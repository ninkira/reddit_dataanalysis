( we \u2019 re all females. idk if that \u2019 s a significant detail or not ). they are both moms and i am not so they came to my home for a night away from the kids. we were chit chatting on my balcony ( approx. 11pm ) while one friend had a smoke and my german neighbor leaned out his window and started yelling at us in german. none of us speak the language unfortunately so we couldn \u2019 t converse with him or even understand what he was saying. one friend picked out the words \u201c americans \u201d and \u201c police \u201d. we used a translator to try to explain we were trying not to be loud but he continued yelling for a bit, then went back inside. we just continued chatting trying to be a little more quiet when he came out again not 10 minutes later yelling the same thing. even though i couldn \u2019 t understand him it was clear he was saying \u201c americans \u201d a lot and \u201c police \u201d a lot. this really put a damper on my mood honestly cuz my social anxiety made me feel like i did something wrong and i genuinely felt bad for making him angry. mind you our landlord lives above us and more of his family lives below us ( three apartments in this house ) and none of them ever said anything about us being too loud. we went back inside to talk and be considerate but the longer the night went on the more angry and upset i got. when i woke up this morning i decided to be petty and painted an american flag on the window facing his house next door as well as put a folded flag we have in the same window. sorry not sorry for being the american neighbors you got next door. could have easily had much less considerate american neighbors. am i the asshole?
