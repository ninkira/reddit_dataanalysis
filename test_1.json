    "title": "AITA for lying to my husband's grandmother about the severity of an injury she caused to my son?",
    "content": "My husband's paternal grandmother has an \"oh don't worry, everything will work out fine\" mentality. I didn't think it extended to *the safety of newborn babies* though, or I never would've let her babysit my 3mo son, even for just 3 hours. About a week and a half ago while she was babysitting, I got a call from her saying my son had \"a bit of a tumble\".\n\nI heard my son *screaming* in the background and my instincts said something was extremely wrong, so I said to get off the phone with me and call an ambulance, then call me back and tell me what happened once the ambulance was on the way. She started handwaving it with \"I don't think we need to bother with an ambulance, babies are tougher than they look you know, basically made of rubber.\"\n\nWhen I said he sounded like he was hurt she admitted he had \"a bit of a scrape and a bruise\" and when I pushed further she said it was on his head. I hung up and called the ambulance myself because I wasn't about to sit there and waste time trying to convince this idiot that a *head injury on a 3mo baby* is a serious thing.\n\nMy absolute hero of a boss drove me to the hospital because I was in no state to drive, and I needed to be on the phone to notify my husband and then get the full story from his grandmother. It turns out she not only dropped my son, she dropped him while walking down the stairs, so he fell onto the second from bottom step and hit his head on the third from bottom step. She then wasted time *calling her son*, who told her she should probably call me or my husband.\n\nAt the hospital she kept being dismissive, saying I was overreacting and my son would be fine, until I made her leave. As it turns out, my son has a minor fracture in his skull, which will heal on its own, though it will take a couple of months. We're so incredibly lucky. The doctor said a fall like that could have easily caused a life threatening brain injury, and my husband's grandmother hesitating to call an ambulance absolutely could have increased his risk of serious disability or death.\n\nI was furious with her, but I felt she should know my son was ok so I called her, but when she answered me call with \"what did I tell you, he's fine, isn't he?\" Her condescending tone and blas\u00e9 attitude to my son's safety pissed me off, so I said \"actually we're still not sure if he's going to make it.\" Then the apologies and the guilt and the distress came out.\n\nMy husband called her later to tell her my son would be fine. My husband's father and grandmother are really mad, they think it was a dirty trick to lie to an old lady about her great grandson's injury, but my husband and I maintain that she deserved to feel bad about what happened to my son, and she obviously wasn't until she thought his life was in danger. I for one will never let her near my son again, but I hope she'll now be more careful about the safety of any other children she has care over.",

I have to wonder if that played a role here. Her actions *after* the fall were stupid, reckless, and dangerous... but people don't just *drop infants down the stairs*. If she is *slipping* physically and/or mentally then everyone else in the family needs to wise up, put their foot down, and \"be careful\" *themselves* instead counting on someone who just can't make those decisions anymore.",

When they hear \"He's fine, thank god, the skull is cracked but will heal, no long-term damage\", they stop listening after *he's fine* and the rest just doesn't matter, even though an infant with a cracked skull, no matter how good the outlook on recovery, is SCARY! If you ask me, this lady needed (and in future needs) to hear a no-nonsense, this-is-were-it's-at \"due to your negligence, when he fell on his head, the skull cracked. this will take at least x months to heal, and \\[...\\]\".
