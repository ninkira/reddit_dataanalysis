[{"title": "AITA for potentially traumatizing my neighbors children after they kept coming onto my property and trying to get into my house?", "content": "Me and my now fiance have lived in this house and neighborhood for a few months now. I have a 1 year old son myself, so I know how kids can be. However, my neighbors have 3 children. A 9, 12, and 14 year old. All of them are boys. At first they weren't too much trouble, I would just seem them running around, throwing sticks, riding scooters across the street. \n\nBut as of recently they had started getting a lot closer to my property. This all started with the oldest one throwing various trash into our yard that my fiance would continually have to pick up. Then, all 3 children started digging holes in our yard, banging on the door, and I even caught them trying to \"lockpick\" my front door with a bobby pin. This had happened 4 to 5 times already. Of course, I brought this up to their mother who has done little about it. They seem to have very little supervision and apparently cps had already been called numerous of times because of how often they seemed to be left alone. \n\nI warned the mother that we have 2 big dogs, whose sole purpose was to protect against intruders. So if their sons happened to actually get into my house they would probably end up hurt. I did not want these little children to end up hurt of course, which was why I was warning her. She brushed it off, saying if anything happened to her boys she would have me promptly arrested and my dogs put down. \n\nSo, I decided to take matters into my own hands, to \"ensure\" the safety of these boys. As expected, the oldest one and his brothers were sneaking around my yard again. I waited until they got closer to the front door. When the second youngest opened the door, I said a command to my dogs and they immediately ran out, barking and growling. \n\nAll the boys screamed and start yelling. They ran and ran all the way until they got to their house, getting wet by the lawn sprinklers on the way. I called my dogs back( they stopped at the end of the lawn like I had trained them to) and we didn't hear much for a few days. Their mother and the police came knocking at the door. She said some stuff about how my dogs bit her children and I was a danger to the neighbors.  But I showed the security footage from my camera to the police and it pretty much died down from there. \n\nShe's still trying to keep the case open, but I feel as if I've done little to no wrong. Her boys don't bother us anymore, and her children aren't hurt and were never going to be.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I did tell the police that they were attempting to break into my house, it was obvious from the video too. I just decided not to press charges considering the only reason they're acting like this is because they have a neglectful mother. From your comments, I've decided to do all I can to get those boys out of there.\n\nLol for those of you saying my dogs are aggressive Maybel can't sleep unless she chews on her stuffie repeatedly and Robbie is scared of spoons.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "OtakuGey", "author_details": {"over_18": true, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 15815, "comment_karma": 7173, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 14900.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p90i38/aita_for_potentially_traumatizing_my_neighbors/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 42, "NTA": 30, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 12}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So my husband and I have separate chores that we've taken on in our relationship and part of mine has always been cleaning the bathrooms. He's never picked up a toilet brush in his life, and I'm usually perfectly fine with doing my part. I cleaned it before we left for dinner tonight and all was well. After dinner, something didn't agree with him and he spent a good 30 minutes in the bathroom (although I could hear him in there playing on his phone for a while). Later, when I went to use it myself, I found that it was destroyed in a way I'm struggling to describe. Dried crap was splattered all over the bowel, all over the bottom of the seat, it was BAD, like I actually gagged.

I said that he needs to clean it, no way am I doing it, especially since I'd just done it hours before. He said so what I'd just done it, that bathroom is my job. He then said that he'd just bought me dinner, and me refusing to clean up his mess made me ungrateful (although he's just come back from a 3 week vacation and I took care of our two kids by myself and the dinner was supposed to be a thank you for that). Things escalated and ended by him shouting \"if you don't clean it that will show me who you really are\" and I don't even know what that means.

So my husband and I have separate chores that we've taken on in our relationship and part of mine has always been cleaning the bathrooms. He's never picked up a toilet brush in his life, and I'm usually perfectly fine with doing my part. I cleaned it before we left for dinner tonight and all was well. After dinner, something didn't agree with him and he spent a good 30 minutes in the bathroom (although I could hear him in there playing on his phone for a while). Later, when I went to use it myself, I found that it was destroyed in a way I'm struggling to describe. Dried crap was splattered all over the bowel, all over the bottom of the seat, it was BAD, like I actually gagged. And I had just cleaned it before we left, so I was especially pissed that he'd made no effort to correct the situation.\n\nWhen I told him I was grossed out, he pretended that he didn't know he'd left it that way, which didn't make sense because he has eyes. I said that he needs to clean it, no way am I doing it, especially since I'd just done it hours before. He said so what I'd just done it, that bathroom is my job. He then said that he'd just bought me dinner, and me refusing to clean up his mess made me ungrateful (although he's just come back from a 3 week vacation and I took care of our two kids by myself and the dinner was supposed to be a thank you for that). Things escalated and ended by him shouting \"if you don't clean it that will show me who you really are\" and I don't even know what that means. All I know is I feel like if the situation were reversed, I wouldn't have left such a mess for him and told him it's his problem to deal with.\n\nSo AITA for not doing a chore I would normally do because of this specific situation? I acknowledge the this is normally my job, but I feel like this is NOT a normal situation!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Decent land between houses, and a lot of forest. \n\nIn between me and my neighbors land there's a decent sized pond. Technically it's all on my land but one side of it is surrounded by neighbor land. There's a dock on it, I upgraded it about 15 years ago so it's somewhat nice. It's right next to the property boundary if that's important. \n\nI go down there somewhat often, I usually am down there for a few hours in the evening with my dog, my work computer, and sometimes a drink. \n\nMy neighbors are in their late 20s/early 30s, moved in a few years ago. They have a pair of young kids, both under ten(I'd guess maybe 5/6 and 8/9). \n\nTheir backyard is not far from where I am in the evening, and neither yard is fenced in. Every few days the kids come outside when I am down by the pond. \n\nI ignore them, but about a week ago my neighbors approached me and asked if I would go inside or somewhere else when their kids were outside. They said I made them feel uncomfortable letting their kids go in the backyard, and that their kids are also scared of my dog. \n\nI do not pay any attention to their kids, I usually am facing away from them, and never directly facing them. I do get why they would not want their kids outside alone with me nearby, as much as it sucks(because this seems to have been misunderstood, I am not on any registry nor do I have any criminal history, however I get that they may feel uneasy about their kids being around a man that they do not know very well). \n\nMy dog is always tied up when he's on the dock with me. He never barks when we're down there usually he naps. He is a fairly large dog(75-80 pounds), but there is almost no chance he could or would hurt them. \n\nThey also expressed concern about me drinking. I do not get anywhere near the point of being intoxicated, it's at most 1 drink when I do have it(and I have it maybe a couple times a month). \n\nI told them that I appreciate them reaching out to me but I'm not going to stop. This week I kept doing it, and I got a somewhat angry letter. \n\nI'm honestly starting to doubt if I should just head inside when they come out. \n\nAITA for not listening to them and WIBTA if I kept doing what I'm doing?\n\nEdit - the pond is basically inaccessible from everywhere except the dock due to plants, so there is almost no chance the kids could fall in", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "Neither_Shape_7455", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 4407, "comment_karma": 1060, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 16038.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p8yldh/aita_neighbor_says_im_making_them_uncomfortable/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 48, "NTA": 35, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 13}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She offered to pay for it since she was proud of my husband for doing what was best for our son, at first we said no because it didn't felt right, but my MIL convinced us saying that she didn't wanted to miss the wedding just as his husband did if we ended up taking too long.\n\nWe made it small and simple because we didn't wanted to take advantage of her and we even let my MIL have her way in some decisions. When the big day came, she's Mindy by her side and my husband and I are confused, my MIL approached us and we asked her what was happening, she said that she'd invited her to the wedding because it was a special day, my husband said that yes, it was a special day for us and that Mindy had no business being there and would appreciate if she left, my MIL looked at me and I said that I would rather that too, but my MIL got angry and said that she paid for the wedding and she could invite anyone she wanted, while we both agree, we said that Mindy wasn't really ''anyone'' and that it was the fact that she didn't told us before rather that inviting her. \n\nShe said that if Mindy had to go she'll follow and my husband said ''then do''. She ended up saying that she's gonna stay but that we had to tell Mindy to leave which my husband gladly did and my MIL spent all the evening mad, after the wedding we offered to pay for half of it or even everything if she wanted but she said that the damaged was already done.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am not on the lease and the utilities are in my boyfriend\u2019s name. We have a 2 bedroom apartment \u2013 the second bedroom used as a combo home office (for me) and music studio (for him).  Then 3 weeks ago his brother moved in. I came home from a weekend trip with my sister and found him there \u2013 no discussion beforehand. I was pissed. My BF swore it was for a week at most until his brother oved in with a friend. So he spent a week on the living room couch.\n\nWell, to no one\u2019s surprise that didn\u2019t happen. The friend decided he didn\u2019t want the brother to move in. Given that the brother doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t clean up after himself and is a general jerk (even my boyfriend admits this about his brother) \u2013 I can\u2019t say I blame the friend. My BF says he can\u2019t kick his brother out when he has no place to go and begged me to give him a couple of months (I had started packing my things). I reluctantly agreed and BF ends up moving my desk into the living room where I have no privacy while I work and his music stuff into a corner of the bedroom where we are basically tripping over it so his brother can have a bedroom. I told BF he has 2 months to get his brother out or I would move out.\n\nIt gets to the time of the month for me to send money to my BF for bills. I send him 25% of the rent and 33% of the utilities instead of 50% for both. BF is upset \u2013 saying that is not what we agreed. I told him I also didn\u2019t agree to live with his brother \u2013 and I\u2019m paying what I feel is fair given that. My thinking is that every apartment I have shared \u2013 you pay rent by bedroom and utilities by person. BF starts freaking out saying that he can\u2019t afford that and that I agreed to his brother staying. I told him that I agreed to not move out \u2013 I did not agree to financially support his brother. He told me that I can\u2019t just change our agreement and I pointed out that he had when he added a third person to the apartment. BF insists he doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay that much (he is short on money and his old roommate moving out is one of the big reasons I moved in). BF says that he will end up having to not pay something and that it will kill his credit which he has been working on rebuilding. He tells me that he is already short because he is having to spend more money on groceries with his brother there (I flatly refused to pay for more groceries). I am refusing to budge.\n\nBF insists that I am trying to hurt him financially because I am angry with him and being petty. I am angry and I know that I can make bad decisions when I am mad. However thinking about it \u2013 I don\u2019t think I should have to support his brother. Living with 2 other people should cost less than living with 1 other person. However I am doubting my own judgment. Am I being petty out of anger? AITA for not paying 50% of the rent?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nThis has come up many times -why didn't I tell BF ahead of time that I wasn't going to pay 50% as normal.  The answer is that I never thought about money until I went to transfer him money for the monthly bills.  That was the first time I realized that I would be financially supporting the brother if I kept paying 50% and I decided I wasn't going to do it.

Sil decided on an upscale restaurant that has sort of \"dress code\" for guests.\nWon't say the name of the restaurant however, *IT'S A WELL KNOWN RESTAURANT IN MEANISOTA!*\nSo, my long term girlfriend *Lauren went shopping and bought stuff that I didn't even look at but I kept reminding her of the dress code rule they had and she said she already found an outfit that goes well with the rule so no worries!\n\nI got ready early and went to the restaurant alone cause Lauren said she'd come later after work. I waited for 20min since Lauren usually takes time to get ready. I texted her to see if everything was ok then she finally arrived and soon as she walked in, suddenly all eyes were on her glittering, bright light dress. She actually showed up in a completely different outfit than the one she showed me which went well with the dress code. But cause she changes her mind about what she wears every 5 min, I wasn't too surprised.\nLauren approached everyone then sat next to me. I whispered \"wtf?, and said that the dress she wore was part of the dress code at all. she shushed me saying no one will notice. Well, everyone did. The head of the staff wanted to have a word with her about it then SIL got involved. I was like, yeah, there's no way this was gunna to end well especially after Lauren and SIL started loudly arguing back and forth.\n\nLauren was asked to leave after she refused to change her dress. She was angry she told me we had to leave. I said not \"we\" but \"she\" since she broke the rule and I didn't. She was shocked by my response and insisted but I said \"Sorry just want to enjoy my brother's engagement\".\nShe complained not having money for an uber and I gave her the key and said she could take my car if she wanted. She walked out eventually and the party continued on. Then I went home and she was waiting for me still angry as hell. She asked why TF I let her go home alone and stayed at the party after the staff &amp; SIL distespected her and kicked her out.\n\nI asked what did she expect after she broke the rule they had. She said she expected to find a way to get around it and my SIL should've sided with her since we're family and also I should've left with her when was asked to leave. She added the dress code was actually very stupid and toooootally not her style anyway. I said she knew she was taking a chance by deciding to ignore the rule and show up like that.\nBut she lashed out saying she tried on over 10 outfits before deciding on this one and there was no way  to change it and I knew that since it's hard to convince her to wear stuff she doesn't like and that I shouldn't let her leave on her own since we're a unit. We've been arguing ever since.\n\n\nETA the dress code consisted of 2 piece outfits for women. Lauren wore a short, bright dress that stood out from the rest of the guests.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "BetterCallSaul7_", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 68, "comment_karma": 25, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 235.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p9bb00/aita_for_not_leaving_my_brothers_engagement_party/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 86, "NTA": 65, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 21}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sil decided on an upscale restaurant that has sort of \"dress code\" for guests.\nWon't say the name of the restaurant however, *IT'S A WELL KNOWN RESTAURANT IN MEANISOTA!*\nSo, my long term girlfriend *Lauren went shopping and bought stuff that I didn't even look at but I kept reminding her of the dress code rule they had and she said she already found an outfit that goes well with the rule so no worries!\n\nI got ready early and went to the restaurant alone cause Lauren said she'd come later after work. I waited for 20min since Lauren usually takes time to get ready. I texted her to see if everything was ok then she finally arrived and soon as she walked in, suddenly all eyes were on her glittering, bright light dress. She actually showed up in a completely different outfit than the one she showed me which went well with the dress code. But cause she changes her mind about what she wears every 5 min, I wasn't too surprised.\nLauren approached everyone then sat next to me. I whispered \"wtf?, and said that the dress she wore was part of the dress code at all. she shushed me saying no one will notice. Well, everyone did. The head of the staff wanted to have a word with her about it then SIL got involved. I was like, yeah, there's no way this was gunna to end well especially after Lauren and SIL started loudly arguing back and forth.\n\nLauren was asked to leave after she refused to change her dress. She was angry she told me we had to leave. I said not \"we\" but \"she\" since she broke the rule and I didn't. She was shocked by my response and insisted but I said \"Sorry just want to enjoy my brother's engagement\".\nShe complained not having money for an uber and I gave her the key and said she could take my car if she wanted. She walked out eventually and the party continued on. Then I went home and she was waiting for me still angry as hell. She asked why TF I let her go home alone and stayed at the party after the staff &amp; SIL distespected her and kicked her out.\n\nI asked what did she expect after she broke the rule they had. She said she expected to find a way to get around it and my SIL should've sided with her since we're family and also I should've left with her when was asked to leave. She added the dress code was actually very stupid and toooootally not her style anyway. I said she knew she was taking a chance by deciding to ignore the rule and show up like that.\nBut she lashed out saying she tried on over 10 outfits before deciding on this one and there was no way  to change it and I knew that since it's hard to convince her to wear stuff she doesn't like and that I shouldn't let her leave on her own since we're a unite. We've been arguing ever since.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's in October. I will be nearing my 8 weeks at that time. My doctor told me in the boot 8 weeks minimum. They know I can remove the brace for short periods of time after 4 weeks and do some weight baring activity. Their response was \"well you can take it off after 4 weeks, so by 8 weeks you can have it off for the wedding It's not that long. It'll ruin pictures and distract from the bride.\" I feel like a complete asshole by not even considering it. I could be healed, or I can always wear a long dress to cover it, but also feel I shouldn't have to do that.

Before we got married, nearly a decade ago, my wife was dating a distant colleague of ours, \"John.\" Their relationship lasted a six months and the breakup was messy. John is utterly brilliant, but he has the neediness of a child. He frequently pestered my wife for \"closure\" after they broke up, even though my wife says the relationship wasn't that serious, and she was uninterested in talking to him. While John was polite to me after my wife and I got together, some of the messages he left for her indicate that he thinks she chose me for my money. (That isn't true).\n\nEventually, John found work in a neighboring city. His attempts to contact my wife became less frequent, and stopped completely a few years ago. She made a point to ignore/block all his calls and messages so as not to encourage him.\n\nRecently, John published some research relating to a current project of mine. I thought it wouldn't hurt to reach out to him and ask for a (socially-distanced) lunch outing, and he could decline if he was uncomfortable. As stated above, John is brilliant, and I really wanted to hear his thoughts on a topic we're both researching. I thought it would be a good opportunity to rebuild a bridge. I complimented his recent work and offered to pay for lunch. He offered nice words in return and agreed to meet me at a caf\u00e9 in the city where I work, which is about two hours away from where he works now.\n\nOn the day of our lunch meeting, my wife decided to join us. She and I found a table at the caf\u00e9 and waited for John. When he arrived, he saw us sitting together, turned around, got back in his car, and drove off.\n\nAfter this happened, I emailed John and told him I was disappointed. He responded by saying that it was rude of me to bring additional guests to lunch without letting him know ahead of time, especially since he drove two hours each way. My wife thinks now that John is still in love with her. According to his social media, he's 40 and unmarried. My wife says that, if he is in love with her still, then we definitely fucked up. But it's been a decade and, personally, I think he should be over it.

Before we got married, nearly a decade ago, my wife was dating a distant colleague of ours, \"John.\" Their relationship lasted a six months and the breakup was messy. John is utterly brilliant, but he has the neediness of a child. He frequently pestered my wife for \"closure\" after they broke up, even though my wife says the relationship wasn't that serious, and she was uninterested in talking to him. While John was polite to me after my wife and I got together, some of the messages he left for her indicate that he thinks she chose me for my money. (That isn't true).\n\nEventually, John found work in a neighboring city. His attempts to contact my wife became less frequent, and stopped completely a few years ago. She made a point to ignore/block all his calls and messages so as not to encourage him.\n\nRecently, John published some research relating to a current project of mine. I thought it wouldn't hurt to reach out to him and ask for a (socially-distanced) lunch outing, and he could decline if he was uncomfortable. As stated above, John is brilliant, and I really wanted to hear his thoughts on a topic we're both researching. I thought it would be a good opportunity to rebuild a bridge. I complimented his recent work and offered to pay for lunch. He offered nice words in return and agreed to meet me at a caf\u00e9 in the city where I work, which is about two hours away from where he works now.\n\nOn the day of our lunch meeting, my wife decided to join us. She and I found a table at the caf\u00e9 and waited for John. When he arrived, he saw us sitting together, turned around, got back in his car, and drove off.\n\nAfter this happened, I emailed John and told him I was disappointed. He responded by saying that it was rude of me to bring additional guests to lunch without letting him know ahead of time, especially since he drove two hours each way. My wife thinks now that John is still in love with her. According to his social media, he's 40 and unmarried. My wife says that, if he is in love with her still, then we definitely fucked up. But it's been a decade and, personally, I think he should be over it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is especially important to me because my 8 month old is eating solids now (baby led weaning) and I give her whatever I\u2019m eating in age appropriate pieces to avoid picky eating and I don\u2019t want her seeing her dad and brother and emulating then. \n\nMy partner was upset that I refused to cook a separate breakfast for him. I stand by my decision to not cook an additional meal and if it\u2019s that much of an issue, either stepson\u2019s mom or my partner needs to prepare his meals themselves to give to me. \n \nI do feel bad because I obviously don\u2019t want my kid to starve but I also don\u2019t want to encourage his picky eating. \n\n(And no, he does not have any kind of sensory issues. He just likes plain foods, sweets and basic fruits.)\n\nETA: I seem to have sparked some confusion with my use of the word \u201csafe food\u201d. I only meant that with every meal, I offer a dish that I know for certain he\u2019ll eat, like mashed potatoes, rice, corn on the cob, pasta.\n\nETA2: Yikes, I hit a lot of nerves with this one. My kid is 3. Our dinner table rule is he needs to take a bite out of everything on the plate. I try to expose him to as much foods as possible just like I do with my daughter. The other adults don\u2019t do this and he literally gets what he wants to eat every time he\u2019s with his mom and his grandma and even my SO when he\u2019s the one cooking. So when he\u2019s used to getting food like cheeseburgers, nuggets and fries or mac and cheese. he doesn\u2019t like eating vegetables or fish or even beef when he\u2019s here. And I guess picky may not have been the right word? I mean, he does eat different stuff when he\u2019s encouraged, but it\u2019s a battle. I\u2019m often sitting at the table feeding him myself. If it\u2019s not food he loves, he goes into \u201cno\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t want it\u201d mode.

I\u2019ve tried to battle it as much as possible by offering him different foods, but it\u2019s so difficult when not every adult is on board. My partner, stepson\u2019s mother and my MIL (who watches stepson while everyones at work) are all picky eaters in some way. MIL and stepson\u2019s mother don\u2019t eat seafood, my partner has a whole list of foods he won\u2019t eat including most cooked vegetables and raw fruits. On the other hand, I grew up eating almost everything. \n\nThis morning, I made some strawberry pancakes for everyone and my stepson didn\u2019t want it. My partner tells me to make him something else instead. This is normally what happens every time we cook, he has to have separate meals made for him. I always make sure we have at least one safe food for him to eat for every meal but I told my partner that I am not going to make a completely separate meal just for him because it just solidifies his picky eating. That he can eat his safe food or if he\u2019s really hungry, eat what everyone else is eating. This is especially important to me because my 8 month old is eating solids now (baby led weaning) and I give her whatever I\u2019m eating in age appropriate pieces to avoid picky eating and I don\u2019t want her seeing her dad and brother and emulating then. \n\nMy partner was upset that I refused to cook a separate breakfast for him. I stand by my decision to not cook an additional meal and if it\u2019s that much of an issue, either stepson\u2019s mom or my partner needs to prepare his meals themselves to give to me. \n \nI do feel bad because I obviously don\u2019t want my kid to starve but I also don\u2019t want to encourage his picky eating. \n\n(And no, he does not have any kind of sensory issues. He just likes plain foods, sweets and basic fruits.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I could also do more small stuff because it was two vs a bunch of them.

We found out his wife lived across the country with her kids and was moving in the day before the wedding. It was a big surprise but what was worse was, apparently, even though I got something for all kids, he was pissed off at me for spending less than I had others years. He said nothing for months. Then his 6 year old stepson's birthday was last week and he confronted me afterward. He said I hadn't spent as much as I usually do, that I financially treated my bio niece/nephew different to my step nieces/nephews and that the birthday gift showed that. I told him that wasn't true and it was unfair for me to increase my budget to include four more kids which would cost me thousands on Christmas alone and for birthday gifts throughout the year. I said I had a budget for each kid at Christmas and had the same plan for birthdays and that yes, it was less individually than others years, but technically I still spent more than I had previously but I adjusted it so I could be both fair and not put myself into debt. He said it was still favoritism and hurt his stepkids because they saw the stuff Kai and Elle got from me other years and what they got from me.

It's a smaller, cheaper wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I want to buy a home in the next year or two and we want the money that could go on a wedding to go on savings for a home together. We're only doing a single bridesmaid/groomsman each. No flower girls or page boys or anything of the sort. Nobody had any issue with this.\n\nThen my niece was excluded from her uncle's wedding in May. So my sister is her mom. My sisters husband/niece's dad comes from a blended family and his half brother chose to include all the kids in the family except my niece who is 6. 8 kids total were included, were flower girls and page boys, but my niece wasn't. They didn't know until they showed up at the wedding. My niece was really upset because the other kids also got a fun day out with the couple as a treat for being in the wedding. My sister and her husband were heartbroken and furious at the same time and cut them out.\n\nNow my sister wants me to make up for it by making a flower girl role for her and giving her that experience. She wants me to pay and says it's not a big expense. But my fianc\u00e9 has a niece and we'd have to include her too so she's not snubbed. And that's more money on us. Money we can't afford to put into the wedding. Not to mention if she wants me to make the role I have a feeling the next thing will be the fun experience. I told her I could not stretch the budget to make it work. She told me it's one expense to make my niece's year and to help make up for the asshole move her in-law's made. She told me a good aunt would do this. That I should think about my niece instead of our budget.\n\nAITA for saying no?\n\nMy sister is furious I am sticking to my no. She thinks I'm making things so much worse. And while I am heartbroken for my niece I just can't spend more money. We had every penny accounted for and now my sister is asking for this. I feel so bad though.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If the toy is abandoned on the ground and nobody's playing with it and the parent hasn't gone to pick it up, sure play with it, otherwise you go and ask and if the kid says no, you gotta move on.\n\nI also don't force my kid to share his toys, I let him decide, I only occasionally control and hide the more expensive toys or those with some sentimental value, otherwise he can decide for himself when and what to share.\n\nEdit to add: however, while I don't think sharing is mandatory, seeing a parent literally chase down somebody else's toddler so they can (rudely) pull the toy from the toddler's hands, leaving them crying, when nobody was even playing with the toy before that, is just ugly and pathetic.

Many adults are incapable of sharing. However, learning to enforce your own boundaries and learning how to say \u201cno\u201d are important skills too. It\u2019s completely reasonable for a kid to not want to share (because they\u2019re using it or it\u2019s a favorite toy). You can\u2019t learn to balance both skills without practice and the park is a perfect place to learn how to share AND how to say no. When another kid says no it\u2019s another learning opportunity to gain skills surrounding coping with disappointment and managing expectations. \n\nI bring toys to the park with the intent to share every time. I even bring extras so that it\u2019s easier to tandem play/share. I often leave toys that we aren\u2019t okay sharing at home with the exception of our balance trike. No kid has so far asked to play with it but my planned response is \u201cI can understand why you would like a turn with this toy but it\u2019s his favorite and it\u2019s not for sharing. I am sorry. How about we find something else to play with instead?\u201d I understand that not every parent is like me and when my kid wants to play with another kids\u2019 toy, we ask if we can play.

We didn\u2019t even make it our first year though when I found out the woman I slept with had my son we didn\u2019t know about.

Had a drunk one night stand then told her what happened. She decided she wanted to work on getting past this betrayal I committed. Two years later we got married, already had our son and daughter (twins). We didn\u2019t even make it our first year though when I found out the woman I slept with had my son we didn\u2019t know about. And that was too much for my ex and we divorced because I wanted to be part of my son\u2019s life. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years now. My ex and I keep it civil for the most part but don\u2019t interact much if we don\u2019t have to. And my kids get along great. My son adores my youngest and they really look up to him. The twins turned 6 a week ago. We had a party at my house to celebrate. Usually we do parties separately but since this year my ex doesn\u2019t have enough money for her own party she wanted to attend the one at my house.\n\nI told her that was fine but gave a heads up my son will be there. She hasn\u2019t seen him at all since we found out about him. My ex wasn\u2019t happy with that. She asked why was it necessary that he be there. I told her like it was obvious because he\u2019s our kids\u2019 brother and what kid doesn\u2019t want to go to a party? She asked me not to bring him because she\u2019d really like to be there for the twins. Didn\u2019t see that as fair to my son since he\u2019s already invited and what happened wasn\u2019t his fault. I told her she could come before his mom drops him off because he\u2019s supposed to spend the night with me after that (we were all gonna go to my parents house the next day). We got into a huge argument because she wants to be there for the kids but I wouldn\u2019t uninvited my son. \n\nShe didn\u2019t end up going. Got told off by her and my ex MIL. Because she wanted to be there for our kids but I wasn\u2019t considerate of how him being there would affect her. And that\u2019s why they think I was an asshole. For not keeping my son from going so that she could spend that time with the kids. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because he is doing an apprenticeship and I'm in college we both don't have much money and are each living with our parents. We have to visit each other on the weekends and stay at our PILs houses.\nHis mother and I don't really get along and I'm not allowed to stay longer than the weekend. \n\nNow the situation :\nMy best friend (20F) who lives in my BFs city called me on a Sunday crying and telling me that a horrible family emergency happend. I asked my BF if I could stay for two weeks at his place because two weeks later was her birthday. He asked his parents and they said it's fine. After her birthday my best friend called me and asked me to stay longer and that I could sleep at her place. I agreed and stayed 3 days at her place, where I got bronchitis. Thursday night my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to come back to his place and I asked if it's okay for his parents. He said he didn't asked them but it will probably be alright so he picked me up and I spend the night there.\n\nWhen I woke up he said his mother wants me gone immediately. I said I can't leave now because my best friend is gone until the next day so I can't stay at her place and I can't drive home because of a rail strike (I don't have a car) . Also I was sick at the moment (literally coughing blood) and had my period. He said his mother didn't care so I left.Outside I started crying and called my sister (16F). She told my mother who said she will pick me up and drove 1,5 hours to get me. \n\nWhen I went to the car, my bf and his mom came out of the house too (MIL allowed me to wait for my mother at their place) and greeted my mother. My mother was angry but kept cool and even shook my MILs hand, but without saying a word. My mother gave me painkillers and food and we drove away. 10 minutes after that I got a message from my bf that he is furious because his mother started crying after we drove away because my mother was so cold to her. He said that I am a terrible human being because I allegedly talked shit about his mother so that my mother would be angry and said I was disrespectful because I was allowed to stay two weeks and I wouldn't respect his parents decisions about not staying longer than weekends. Also the fact that my mother brought me food made it seem like I wouldn't get food there which is also disrespectful according to his mother. My boyfriends whole family is mad that we made my MIL cry and he demanded that I apologize to his mother, while I think she should. \n\nSo AITA because I didn't apologize to my MIL?", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "jaowngap", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 312, "comment_karma": 210, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 495.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p95er0/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_21f_future_mil_58f/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 91, "NTA": 35, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 56}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because he is doing an apprenticeship and I'm in college we both don't have much money and are each living with our parents. We have to visit each other on the weekends and stay at our PILs houses.\nHis mother and I don't really get along and I'm not allowed to stay longer than the weekend. \n\nNow the situation :\nMy best friend (20F) who lives in my BFs city called me on a Sunday crying and telling me that a horrible family emergency happend. I asked my BF if I could stay for two weeks at his place because two weeks later was her birthday. He asked his parents and they said it's fine. After her birthday my best friend called me and asked me to stay longer and that I could sleep at her place. I agreed and stayed 3 days at her place, where I got bronchitis. Thursday night my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to come back to his place and I asked if it's okay for his parents. He said he didn't asked them but it will probably be alright so he picked me up and I spend the night there.\n\nWhen I woke up he said his mother wants me gone immediately. I said I can't leave now because my best friend is gone until the next day so I can't stay at her place and I can't drive home because of a rail strike (I don't have a car) . Also I was sick at the moment (literally coughing blood) and had my period. He said his mother didn't care so I left.Outside I started crying and called my sister (16F). She told my mother who said she will pick me up and drove 1,5 hours to get me. \n\nWhen I went to the car, my bf and his mom came out of the house too (MIL allowed me to wait for my mother at their place) and greeted my mother. My mother was angry but kept cool and even shook my MILs hand, but without saying a word. My mother gave me painkillers and food and we drove away. 10 minutes after that I got a message from my bf that he is furious because his mother started crying after we drove away because my mother was so cold to her. He said that I am a terrible human being because I allegedly talked shit about his mother so that my mother would be angry and said I was disrespectful because I was allowed to stay two weeks and I wouldn't respect his parents decisions about not staying longer than weekends. Also the fact that my mother brought me food made it seem like I wouldn't get food there which is also disrespectful according to his mother. My boyfriends whole family is mad that we made my MIL cry and he demanded that I apologize to his mother, while I think she should. \n\nSo AITA because I didn't apologize to my MIL?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No question there. My own MIL is just as crazy and it's the reason we went no contact with her.  And your bf is equally to blame on that part since he was the one who invited you over without permission and caused the whole mess. If your mother was cold to her I'm not surprised because having to drive about 3 hours round trip without notice would piss me off too. So her reaction after the fact is totally bogus and the fact your bf can't see that makes him not worth the time.\n\nOn the other hand had this been 2019 I would probably say 90% not the a however it's 2021 now. Your future mil allowed you over under the assumption you were coming from your house to her house. You then left her house, stayed with someone else in the middle of a pandemic and came back to her house looking and coughing like the plague without her consent. She has no idea where you had been or who you had been in contact with. Now your bf is a butt, unless he owns the house he should always double check on guests, it's common courtesy especially during a pandemic. But I don't blame future mil for freaking out when as you said you are coughing up blood and probably look like a poster for the plague.

More than likely what happened is he partied hard after the breakup and got hooked on coke and his friends blame you. That\u2019s not your fault and it\u2019s not even a good guilting reason. No one feels bad for anyone who gets hooked on a drug that costs $90 a gram minimum (in case you aren\u2019t aware, marijuana is sold $10-$15 a gram on average).

You\u2019re not a solution or an anti drug. You\u2019re a person. \n\nPart 2, after 7 years of being with this guy through childhood, that\u2019s not how a future MIL acts. Not at all. I\u2019m my boyfriends first serious relationship and he\u2019s also the youngest, when we were trying to move back to the same state as our families (I\u2019m 21 as well btw) she offered to let me stay as long as I needed to find a job or anything I needed because she knew I wasn\u2019t super comfortable staying with my family at the time. She treats me like family and I\u2019ve been with him for far less time than you. I didn\u2019t grow up with him like you did. \n\nPart 3, even if that was one of the problems the main thing is how your boyfriend treated you. That\u2019s just actually disgusting. No one who loves anyone would kick them out and leave them on a curb to figure it out when you\u2019re spewing blood. I wouldn\u2019t even do that to a stranger because it\u2019s just so messed up.

We have been married for a while now. From the start it was pretty much me handling our finances, bills, groceries, even some of our wedding costs. I once even volunteered to pay his rent of 3 months(he lived with his brothers) and paid a few thousand of his loans too. The past year I have been managing everything from bills to rent to groceries, with him occasionally contributing to the rent. The problem with him is that his family used to be loaded and then they hit rock bottom, long story short he\u2019s been used to that kind of life and spending and can\u2019t get out of it. He can\u2019t keep jobs and gets himself fired from pretty much every position. He has invested a lot of money(i had to sell some of my jewellery)in forex and lost every single penny and it all made our situation worse. I was sick of asking my family for money all the time, and was living pay check to pay check. Then I found out I was pregnant so I started saving up money on pretty much everything and made a secret bank account and I am pretty proud of how it looks rn. My husband doesn\u2019t know and he\u2019s recently left his most current job and we\u2019re practically living in poverty.

I then discovered the social media post and how many family and friends thought this house was purchased with our own money. I even have no idea how long this has been going on.\n\nTo start, I want to mention that my wife and my mother (deceased) never had a very strong relationship. Yes, they were cordial to each other but had many disagreements. Mom passed away and left me a one story house as my only inheritance.\nNo one lived in it after she renovated it so it looked fairly new. My wife was happy and excited when we moved in she posted a video on social media and wrote that the house was bought with our money. I didn't know about her saying that until later.\n\n\nHer aunt was visiting from a distance to see the house my wife told her we purchased.\nWe sat to eat and chat a bit and her aunt brought up the house's value asking how we could afford to buy it so suddenly. I was confused as my wife went on about putting money we've saved together towards buying it. I asked what she was talking about and her aunt said my wife told her the house was bought with our money and cost xxx amount. I corrected her sayin this wasn't true because this house belonged to mom and she gave it to me after her passing. I added that no, we're not doing well financially to be able to afford this house.\n\nRoom went radio silence. My wife's aunt said \"what? I'm sorry I didn't know that\" my wife's cousin side eyed her and said \"So isn't this mother inlaw the same mother inlaw you hated for years? Shame she's not here so you can thank her for leaving you this nice house\". My wife was stuned at this point and excused herself to the bathroom.\n\n\nShe didn't come out til they left. Then she blew up at me asking why I told them the house was inheritaned from my mom and making her look like a liar infront of them. I redirected the question at her and asked why she told them otherwise. She said there was no harm in showing off our new property and that people will appreciate us more for saying we bought it with our own money instead of inheritaned it. I argued that this was wrong and unfair for my mom even if they never got along. She argued that I ruined her joy and humiliated her infront of her family and because word got out, now everyone knows and will think she is a liar when I could've simply played along since my mom wouldn't possibly mind it or cause an issue over it now that she's deceased so it won't matter to her.\n\nI stormed out after arguing with her and refusing to admit I messed up by not being part of the lie.\n\nAita?", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "57996A4333", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 3876, "comment_karma": 447, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 15508.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p8ql2y/aita_for_revealing_to_my_wifes_family_we_didnt/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 73, "NTA": 51, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 22}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She'd had cancer for almost 2 years. She knew she was dying and before it happened she wrote a letter telling our stepmom she had never loved her, never wanted her around and that she was not welcome at her funeral as well as other stuff my sister didn't tell me about. I knew the idea of the letter was to let our stepmom know she had never grown to love her. She asked me to give it to her before she died and I did what she asked. I heard nothing about the letter for months. Neither my dad or stepmom showed up to the funeral and my dad was talking to me like normal.\n\nThen a month ago he confronted me over it. He asked what kind of stunt it was and how could I be so cruel to someone who was grieving. I told him she had wanted me to give her the letter, that she wrote it and wanted our stepmom to know. I think he was shocked because he seemed to think I wrote the letter or something, or maybe our mom since she and our stepmom always hated each others guts. My dad was really upset and asked had she always felt that way. I said yeah. He stopped the conversation and went back to his place and it was a week after when he and my stepmom said I was a cruel bastard for doing that to them. That I should have burned the letter and let my sisters last words to my stepmom be something else.\n\nMy dad told me he was done with me. That I had broken his wife's heart, that I had trampled on 13 years of being our stepmom all to help my sisters bitterness be the thing that lived on instead of something else,\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a desperate last resort my uncle reached out to the extended family for financial assistance. Despite being in a position to help, I refuse to, because when the situation was reversed 15 years ago, my uncle chose to do nothing.\n\n**15 years ago \u2014 My family's brush with poverty.**\n\nFifteen years ago my family suffered a series of unfortunate events that forced us on the edge of poverty. Fortunately, through the generosity of our extended family, we managed to make it through to the other end (if just barely). This generosity meant that much more considering that most of my extended family themselves suffered from financial hardship.\n\nThe exception is my uncle. At the time he was several years into his career as an engineer at one of the top engineering firms, and yet entirely ignored my family's plight. While my family struggled, Jeff was flaunting his six figure BMW. Which is his right, of course. Though I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel some resentment, but I understand that this resentment stemmed from a place of entitlement.\n\n**Today \u2014 My uncle's bid for financial assistance**\n\nFast forward 15 years and fortunately my family are in a much better off. I've since graduated, almost a decade into my career, and am in the fortuitous position of being able to ensure that my family never has to worry about money ever again.\n\nIn those same 15 years my uncle has founded his own engineering firm, and was wildly successful until the pandemic forced his business into involuntary administration. The situation is now dire enough that several months ago my uncle begun asking the extended family for financial assistance.\n\nBut what he needed was beyond what the extended family could provided, though the extended family did do the best that they could. I've thus far kept silent. Unfortunately that silence has not gone by unnoticed.\n\n**Am I the asshole?**\n\nMy uncle called me earlier today asking for a $10,000 loan to keep his son enrolled in his son's private school. He tried to sell me some sob story about how disruptive it would be to my cousin's development if he would be forced to change schools in this \"pivotal development period\".\n\nFrankly, I don't see how any of that is my problem.
