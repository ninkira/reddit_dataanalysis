[{"title": "AITA my nephews missed a flight because they wouldn't put their seat belts on?", "content": "My brother is working and he asked me to take his nephews, 13 and 15 year olds to the airport to fly to their grandparents. I picked them up and I drive off, I then got the annoying car notification telling me their seatbelts aren't on. \n\nI told them to put the seatbelts on and they refused. I told them I don't care, it's like a 500 dollar fine to drive a minor without a seat belt on or something in California. They kept being spoiled brats saying they don't need to and dad let's then not wear seatbelts. I said I don't care, I won't drive until they wear their seatbelt. \n\nThey kept whining they're going to miss the flight, I said that's their problem. They called their dad who starts yelling at them telling them to wear it. They do eventually so we drive but we get stuck in traffic and miss the flight. \n\nMy brother is fucking pissed saying it's my fault for just not driving them.

It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been talking about, and when his lease ended he moved into my apartment.\n\nI have a cat, Millie, who is my baby girl that I\u2019ve had since she was a kitten. Back when my BF and I first started dating, he made the joke that if we were ever going to live together, he\u2019d have to \u201cget rid of that cat\u201d, which I dismissed at the time.\n\nWhen he would come over he would ignore Millie, making jokes about how cats are stuck up, how much he\u2019s a dog person. Again, I dismissed this, bc he never acted hostile towards her. I figured it was just a preference.\n\nWhen we started to get serious about moving in, he asked if I would consider giving her away, bc he didn\u2019t like the idea of living with a cat. I almost laughed before realizing he was serious. I told him that under no circumstances would I get rid of my cat. I felt guilty about being unwilling to compromise, but he actually took it well, and reassured me that if she was this important to me, he\u2019d get over it.\n\nFast forward to last night. I don\u2019t think he realized I was in the kitchen when he came home. Millie was on the couch and I heard him go into the room and give this sigh.\n\nBefore I could call out, I heard him say \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking worthless.\u201d\n\nIt terrified me, because I\u2019ve never ever heard him speak with such malice. He sounded like a different person. It was just so cold and hostile that I panicked, and rushed out there to see him looking at Millie.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. I completely freaked out. I was yelling asking what he thought he was doing talking to her like that? He jumped and I scooped Millie up and told him to leave my apartment right now.\n\nHe looked so stunned and started to argue, asking where was he supposed to go? I told him that I don\u2019t care, he just needs to leave.\n\nHe was pissed and said he was going for a drive and slammed the door behind him. I immediately started sobbing and holding Millie. I was shaking and she could tell I was upset and kept cuddling me. She calmed me down, and later when he text asking if he could come back, I said yes.\n\nI put Millie in the bedroom so we could talk. We were both a lot calmer, and I felt awful after he explained his side. I\u2019ll often call Millie little names and he said he was just trying to be playfully mean too and misjudged his tone. But he said it felt awful that I chose a cat over him, and that I called it \u201cmy\u201d apartment when it\u2019s supposed to be our place. He told me he was constantly feeling second best to Millie, who I wouldn\u2019t even consider rehoming, and I had thrown him out over an animal when he\u2019s a person.\n\nI explained to him how much he means to me, and apologized for ever making him feel like this wasn\u2019t his home.\n\nI think I might have overreacted, but I just don\u2019t know. He\u2019s my boyfriend and she\u2019s something I keep refusing to compromise on. But I also don\u2019t believe that he just misjudged his tone.

Ellie loves cookies and takes it very seriously when her cookies go missing. My wife is also pregnant with twins and sometimes loses track of how many cookies she eats. \n\nLast night my wife came to me and said she ate the rest of the cookies. I said no problem and that we'll go to the store today for more. \n\nEllie went to the kitchen for a snack and looked into the cookie jar to find it empty. She ran to me and said that we had an emergency- the cookies were missing! I helped her look for them but after a few minutes, she realized they were really gone. I told her the cookie monster must've snuck in while sleeping and stolen the cookies. Needless to say, she's very mad at the cookie monster right now. \n\nI took her to target and when we were buying cookies, she said we need to get another package to hide in the pantry in case the cookie monster came back. I said that was a good idea and we left with our replacement cookies and our emergency cookies. \n\nWhen we got home, my wife pulled me aside and said that I shouldn't have said the cookie monster stole the cookies when I knew she did it and that I'm implying that she's the cookie monster. \n\nI didn't think it was a big deal but she seemed pretty hurt so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We drew up a contract and have a payment plan in place. We have enough money from the sale to buy the condo we were looking at.\n\nLisa and I were talking today and she asked how selling the house is going and I told her that we're selling it to Henry and Abigail.\n\nShe was enraged when I told her and said that we should've offered to sell our house to her too since she's looking for a bigger place too (she didn't tell us this).

This was 6 years ago in a major metropolis (with a housing market like NYC or San Fran) and the house is worth close to 2 mil now. Buuuut my sister and BIL railroaded them into a house that they liked in the area they wanted. And then proceeded to be rude as hell so my parents (especially my mom) weren\u2019t comfortable living there. They had a big blowout and were going to sell the house but they pouted hard enough and agreed to pay for half the house. So they get to live in a 2 million dollar house for $600000. Me and my younger sister both live in small duplexes that we\u2019ve paid for ourselves. I have 3 kids and my other sisters have one but my younger sister will have more. Older sister is one and done. But they get the five bedroom house and my parents can only visit occasionally for a couple weeks at a time (that\u2019s all they can stand). It\u2019s caused huge strife in my parents marriage to the point where divorce has been brought up - my mom regrets it bitterly because of how unfair it is, my dad refuses to acknowledge the unfairness because he thinks it will shake out evenly in the estate. But get this - the house is in my sisters name so it\u2019s not actually in the estate, it\u2019s current market value will just be the benchmark for the estate when the time comes. My dad refuses to acknowledge the huge advantage they are giving them by allowing them to make that investment and also the fact that they get to live in a house worth more than double what they\u2019re paying for however many years until it supposedly goes into the estate. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have minded if my sister and BIL could have been decent people and their plan had worked out (meaning my parents actually lived there half the year). But that blew up spectacularly so there is a lot of resentment on my end. But I\u2019ve made my peace with it and am just assuming I won\u2019t see a penny from that house.

We can't seem to agree on much of anything, but I am very non-confrontational and try my best to make him proud to avoid arguments. One topic that I have never been willing to compromise on is college, though. I began talking about college during my freshman year of high school, and from the get-go, the topic was unwelcomed. It angered him that I wanted to talk about college and the excuses never stopped: \"I don't have enough confidence in you yet.\" \"You're not ready yet.\" \"You're in too much of a rush to leave me,\" etc.\n\nI felt unsupported, and because of that, I decided that I wouldn't bring up college anymore.\n\nFast forward to 2020-2021: I've graduated salutatorian of my class, got accepted into 13/14 schools applied to, and won 12 scholarships on top of a full ride. Throughout the entirety of my senior year, talking about college was such a hassle. I always felt unsupported in my academic endeavors, so, I made the decision to attend college on my own. I picked a school out of state that offered me a full-ride scholarship, and I broke the news to my stepfather. (At this time, my mom already knew as she was the one who helped me narrow down schools and make the decision.)\n\nHe didn't take the news well. Since May when I told him, every day there has been another argument. I've now been told that I am \"the worst thing that could happen to a man like him,\" and that because I've decided to go to school without his permission, I am doomed to \"be a lesson for my younger siblings about what happens when you don't work together.\" He has even blamed his relationship issues with my mom on me and my decision to go to college!\n\nI feel terrible about it, but I know that it was the only way I could attend school, since no matter what, he would have never supported me. I've tried telling him that I feel this way, but he never seems to listen. Instead, I get the guilt trips of, \"I guess I love you more than you love me,\" and \"Why are you in such a rush to leave like I'm a bad guy?\" I just kind of wish he would be proud of my accomplishments and want me to care about my future as much as I do. \n\nHe says that me going to school is an adult decision that I shouldn't have made alone because it impacts my family. Yet, they aren't paying a dime. In fact, my stepfather says that it is wrong of me to leave only because I would leave more stress on my family because I wouldn't be home to cook, do laundry, and watch my siblings.\n\nAITA for deciding to go to school out of state without his permission?

My parents divorced when I was just two months old and my mom got full custody of me, so I never met my father. All I've ever really known about him is his name and the amount of child support money he transferred into my bank account each month.\n\nNow, in my country, a noncustodial parent is obligated to pay child support up until their child turns 18, but this can be extended for a few more years on the condition that said child decides to pursue a higher education and go to university.\n\nSo as you can already guess, as soon as I turned 18 my father stopped paying child support. But when I graduated highschool and got accepted into an university, I decided to use this extended child support law to my advantage and took him to court. Me and my mom weren't doing all that well financially and I thought the extra money would definitely come in handy.\n\nThe case took quite a few months to get resolved, and the courtroom was the first and last place where I saw my father in person. His reasoning for not wanting to continue paying child support after I turned 18 was that I didn't want to have any sort of relationship with him, so he didn't want to send money to a complete stranger each month anymore. He told the judge he'd agree to continue paying child support on the condition that I agreed to get to know him and talk to him on a regular basis, but I declined. I mean, even if biologically he's my father, this man is nothing more than a stranger to me. I have no real interest in getting to know him and I never did. Wanting to have a relationship with him would be like wanting to have a relationship with the sperm donor who conceived you.\n\nI ended up winning the case, because the law is very clear on the fact that he has to pay child support for as long as I'm in university, regardless of whether I want to actually interact with him or not. Now he has to pay child support every month up until I graduate from university. We ended up getting in a huge argument as soon as the last court hearing was over, and he was really upset because I didn't even want to talk to him for a while and give him a chance but still wanted to \"prey on his money\".\n\nSo from a legal point of view, I'm in the right. But am I in the right from a moral point of view too? Am I an asshole?\n\nI should also add that my father never made any attempts to pursue a relationship with me while I was growing up, and neither did I. My mom never actively tried to get me to meet him, but at the same time she made it clear that she was always open to talk if I wanted to know more about him and ready to answer any questions that I might've had. Except that, well, I never really had any questions to ask her and was never really interested in him. She also never badmouthed my father and never tried to stop us from meeting each other, but neither of us ever made any sort of attempt to do so.\n\nI don't think he's a bad man, but I don't think he's a good man either. He's just a stranger who didn't want to be involved in my life, so I don't want to be involved in his life either. I don't resent him, I have no reason to.

We print artist's work onto merchandise that they can sell or just as high quality prints on fancy paper. We don't have a uniform but we are encouraged to wear tshirts that have been printed at work with art done by ourselves or a colleague (everyone who works here is an artist). \nIt is also important to note that I am autistic.\nOn this day I was wearing a tshirt with my own art on it (a little narcissistic maybe but, I'm proud of my art dang it!). It was a particularly slow day so my colleague left to go get us some soda, leaving me alone in the shop. \nA customer entered (AC), probably late 30s and came straight up to the till. The converstation went as follows:\nMe: 'Hiya! Do you need any help today?'\nAC: 'Ugh, is that really your uniform? I thought you guys printed good stuff'\nMe: 'Sorry? We don't have a uniform but I do like to wear tshirts we print here.'\nAC: 'Well that art is shit, next time you should pick something different'\nMe: (getting annoyed at this point) 'well, art is subjective and I like it so-'\nAC: (interrupting) 'yeah no, art is subjective but that is objectively shit'\nMe: 'Right. Can I help you with anything?'\nAC then orders some of his art to be printed and I had hoped the situation was over with. Nope.\nMe: 'Is that everything for today?'\nAC: 'I still think you should wear some better art next time'\nMe: (completely done) '...This is my art, please stop commenting on it'\nAC blinks at me then holds his hands up, all defensively.\nAC: 'I'm autistic, I can't help but tell the truth! I say it how it is. It's obvious that you didn't go to art school, like I did. You could really learn something...just trying to help'\nNo apology. In that moment, I saw red. I hate when people give other autistic people a bad name just because they never get called out and they never try and learn how to be a decent, fucking, human.\nMe: (sternly, I didn't raise my voice though) 'Being autistic is not an excuse to be shit to someone. Learn some manners. I would like you to leave now.'\nAC sputtered something about calling the manager but there's no cctv and I was too angry to care.\nI know I wont get in trouble but...AITA? Should I have just shrugged it off and let him 'play the autism card'? Should I have not sworn at a customer?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We'll be here for 2 more weeks. I'm fortunate to get along with his family really well.\n\nDuring the course of the visit, I ended up buying myself a specific kind of pillowcase online, to be delivered to me at my in-laws. I have an autoimmune skin condition which is significantly worsened by sleeping on particular fabrics (severe enough to matter; eg, very visible rash + discomfort). The pillowcase was relatively expensive, but I thought it's fine as I could add it into my rotation at home.\n\nMy husband was very upset about my purchase and insisted I shouldn't use it. Context: my family is from a somewhat significantly higher economic bracket than my husband's family. It hasn't really caused tensions before, but my husband thought this pillowcase purchase was 1. flaunting my ability to buy something expensive easily 2. shaming his family for their lesser-quality pillowcases. He suggested I try using some topical medicine if I have an outbreak. I argued that I absolutely would not mind what pillowcase I sleep on, were it not for the skin condition I have, and prefer to use the pillowcase because I find many topical medicines ineffective.\n\nMy husband threw the pillowcase away while I was out with MIL, and on waking the next day my face was red and painful. I bought another pillowcase, intending to keep it hidden and pull it out just at bedtime (to minimize potentially offending his parents, and pissing off husband), but he found this one as well and basically told me I should leave his parents' home if I'm too good to sleep on their pillowcases.\n\nI absolutely do not want to upstage his parents' linens or cause them any offense (I like them a lot). I also can't imagine voluntarily enduring skin outbreaks for the next 2 weeks. I feel like I should be standing my ground in this argument, but I also don't want to ruin this holiday with a relatively petty issue.

We'll be here for 2 more weeks. I'm fortunate to get along with his family really well.  \n\n\nDuring the course of the visit, I ended up buying myself a specific kind of pillowcase online, to be delivered to me at my in-laws. I have an autoimmune skin condition which is significantly worsened by sleeping on particular fabrics (severe enough to matter; eg, very visible rash + discomfort). The pillowcase was relatively expensive, but I thought it's fine as I could add it into my rotation at home.   \n\n\nMy husband was very upset about my purchase and insisted I shouldn't use it. Context: my family is from a somewhat significantly higher economic bracket than my husband's family. It hasn't really caused tensions before, but my husband thought this pillowcase purchase was 1. flaunting my ability to buy something expensive easily 2. shaming his family for their lesser-quality pillowcases. He suggested I try using some topical medicine if I have an outbreak. I argued that I absolutely would not mind what pillowcase I sleep on, were it not for the skin condition I have, and prefer to use the pillowcase because I find many topical medicines ineffective.   \n\n\nMy husband threw the pillowcase away while I was out with MIL, and on waking the next day my face was red and painful. I bought another pillowcase, intending to keep it hidden and pull it out just at bedtime (to minimize potentially offending his parents, and pissing off husband), but he found this one as well and basically told me I should leave his parents' home if I'm too good to sleep on their pillowcases.   \n\n\nI absolutely do not want to upstage his parents' linens or cause them any offense (I like them a lot). I also can't imagine voluntarily enduring skin outbreaks for the next 2 weeks. I feel like I should be standing my ground in this argument, but I also don't want to ruin this holiday with a relatively petty issue.

It\u2019s super confusing how some people r reacting to what I did. Not over the top but still think I was out of line it happened a while back btw. My brother (14) passed away 3 months ago. He had leukemia, getting treatment for it for years. It still hurts and I\u2019m still not in a good place so that why I don\u2019t know if my reaction to my dad was really that bad. I feel like that not even close to what he deserve. He basically deserted us when my bro was 8 and I was 15. It hurt my brother a lot my dad made promises to come pick a us up or visit. None of that actually happened. Then it got to where there was only a phone call maybe once every few months. A year after he left he didn\u2019t even want custody of us when my mom passed so we ended up with my moms parents. For all that shit I was already done with him. But when my brother got sick he wanted my dad around so we communicated. My dad only came to see him once. In the 2 years my brother was sick my dad only came to see him once. \n\nNot even when we knew we had to say goodbye and my brother was asking for my dad. He didn\u2019t wanna go cause it would be too hard. I agree but tough shit it hurt me seeing my brother like that too. Then wasn\u2019t at the funeral either. \n\nReason why they think I\u2019m TA: My dad posted about my brother on his FB. It was a pic of my brother that caught me off guard when I was scrolling and my dad was saying he misses him and couldn\u2019t even attend his own son\u2019s funeral because supposedly he wasn\u2019t  told. It made me so mad I left a long comment on his post not calling him any stuff but saying nobody stopped him from going to his own kid\u2019s funeral (pointed that he knew about it cause he left me on read when I sent him the info) no one stopped him from going to see my brother when he was dying asking where he is because we all told him, and also that nobody stopped him from being a fuckin dad when he walked out on his kids. \n\nIt was kinda cathartic ngl but everything I said was the truth. It just made me angry the way he was talking like he wasn\u2019t given a chance to say goodbye. My dad messaged me privately.

It\u2019s super confusing how some people r reacting to what I did. Not over the top but still think I was out of line it happened a while back btw. My brother (14) passed away 3 months ago. He had leukemia, getting treatment for it for years. It still hurts and I\u2019m still not in a good place so that why I don\u2019t know if my reaction to my dad was really that bad. I feel like that not even close to what he deserve. He basically deserted us when my bro was 8 and I was 15. It hurt my brother a lot my dad made promises to come pick a us up or visit. None of that actually happened. Then it got to where there was only a phone call maybe once every few months. A year after he left he didn\u2019t even want custody of us when my mom passed so we ended up with my moms parents. For all that shit I was already done with him. But when my brother got sick he wanted my dad around so we communicated. My dad only came to see him once. In the 2 years my brother was sick my dad only came to see him once. \n\nNot even when we knew we had to say goodbye and my brother was asking for my dad. He didn\u2019t wanna go cause it would be too hard. I agree but tough shit it hurt me seeing my brother like that too. Then wasn\u2019t at the funeral either. \n\nReason why they think I\u2019m TA: My dad posted about my brother on his FB. It was a pic of my brother that caught me off guard when I was scrolling and my dad was saying he misses him and couldn\u2019t even attend his own son\u2019s funeral because supposedly he wasn\u2019t  told. It made me so mad I left a long comment on his post not calling him any stuff but saying nobody stopped him from going to his own kid\u2019s funeral (pointed that he knew about it cause he left me on read when I sent him the info) no one stopped him from going to see my brother when he was dying asking where he is because we all told him, and also that nobody stopped him from being a fuckin dad when he walked out on his kids. \n\nIt was kinda cathartic ngl but everything I said was the truth. It just made me angry the way he was talking like he wasn\u2019t given a chance to say goodbye. My dad messaged me privately. Mad cause I\u2019m talking shit to him when he only wanted somewhere to vent and he don\u2019t need to be told he\u2019s a shitty dad. My grandma agrees with him and that I should apologize because my dad is a parent grieving the loss of his kid. My grandpa at least on my side but I\u2019ve gotten comments from that post that I should be ashamed of myself. That my dad wasn\u2019t a good dad but he feels guilty for that so I shouldn\u2019t add more to it. Again idk why it so wrong to say that.

I have reasons why I\u2019m uncomfortable crying but there my issues and tbh it\u2019s not normal to be uncomfortable with crying. It is however normal to cry and grieve. I may not like crying but I understand the need to cry and why it\u2019s important for everyone and also important to comfort those in pain.\n\nEmpathy is a trait the large majority of us have. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have this trait. And I\u2019m sorry but he sounds like a narcissist!!

A father is someone you should be able to go to to feel safe, if you have kids they will not feel that way towards him, this is coming from someone raised by a narcissist dad! I never confided in him for nothing and it\u2019s because of him that I find it so hard to show my emotions, I\u2019m 29 years old and although I\u2019m great at rationalising my emotions it\u2019s very rare I actually cry, I\u2019ll cry on the inside but that\u2019s about it.\n\nPlease reconsider your life choices because there are plenty of men out there who will comfort you when your sad and do everything to help you feel better.", "rating": "NTA - Not the asshole", "user_reports": [], "mod_reports": [], "score": 23, "comment_ups": 23}, {"index": 17, "author": "RaymondBeaumont", "content": "NTA.\n\nBullet dodged there. \n\nNow you can find someone human to marry.", "rating": "NTA - Not the asshole", "user_reports": [], "mod_reports": [], "score": 18, "comment_ups": 18}, {"index": 18, "author": "goofberries", "content": "Yeah NTA I think he's not ready for the big leagues yet.", "rating": "Neutral", "user_reports": [], "mod_reports": [], "score": 10, "comment_ups": 10}, {"index": 19, "author": "Down-Right-Mystical", "content": "NTA, and it honestly sounds like you shouldn't be marrying him.

She started doing trying to be an Instagram fitness girl. Then once she got a following she started doing progressively more risqu\u00e9 things to the point where she was literally posting her using toys.\n\nWell eventually I got kinda not okay with it because I didn\u2019t want to date someone who showed her lady parts to any guy with 30 dollars. I asked her if she would stop, she said no, a bunch of arguments ensued and I thought it was best to end out 2 year relationships. \n\nSo a little after the breakup, I\u2019m getting absolute wasted with my friends for the first time in a while since my ex thought I had a drinking problem. And like any guy who just got his heart broken i talk about her. I guess at some point I bring up my ex\u2019s only fans, I don\u2019t remember the night too well. But a few days ago she shows up at my apartment and screams in my face how awful I am. I ask what\u2019s the big deal is and she tells me that my buddy sent her only fans to her dad.\n\nI tell her I know nothing about that.(I literally didn\u2019t) She tells me her parents are going to stop paying for her school and tells me to never speak to her again and storms off.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my friends about it(the ones that didn\u2019t tell her dad), and they didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong. Of course all my girl friends and my sisters thought I was wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He spent the majority of his free time with his friends and I started to feel like I was no longer a priority to him.\n\n2: He started drinking.

We decided to stay friends in order to give our child the best life possible. I grew up without my father and that\u2019s the last thing I wanted for my baby.\n\nAbout a month later I met a really nice guy. We hit it off immediately and started dating not too long after that. He treated me amazing and I was so grateful to have found someone that loved me the way he did.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy my ex was pretty involved.

I was glad to know he cared. \n\nI had planned for him and my sister to be in the delivery room; however, come my delivery day he showed up drunk.\n\nI was pissed.\n\nI made the last minute decision to have my boyfriend in the delivery room instead of my ex. I told him that I did not want someone drunk in with me while I was giving birth and he replied telling me that the alcohol will wear off and he deserves to be in there considering how great he\u2019s been to me my whole pregnancy. \n\nI told him that I wouldn\u2019t change my mind and he proceeded to yell at me saying how it\u2019s just the hormones and I\u2019ll regret having a man I just met in there while I give birth.\n\nOver the past 7 years we\u2019ve been able to maintain a (for the most part) healthy co-parenting relationship. \n\nI am now married to my then boyfriend and I have no regrets having him in there with me but my ex is still sour about me not allowing him to be in the delivery room.

Depending on how drunk he actually was, there was a possibility that he wouldn\u2019t even REMEMBER the birth (obviously this wasn\u2019t the case but it could have happened and you didn\u2019t know at the time) so what was the point of him being in there. \n\n2.) Having someone who is drunk in the delivery room could cause several medical problems. It could range from him distracting doctors from you, who needs their attention in case there\u2019s any complications, to getting into something and harming him or someone else. Which would also take the doctors attention away from you. \n\n3.) Showing up drunk to the delivery of your child shows that he didn\u2019t care as much about the delivery as he says he does. It\u2019s a really important day for the parents. Being drunk reduces your chance of actually remembering the special day. \n\n4.) And finally, the birth of a child is always supposed to focus on the one who is GIVING BIRTH. They are the ones who get to decide who is in that room and who is not. No one has room to talk about that. It is completely up to the person who is giving birth because it is very taxing and painful. The person rightfully gets to decide who will be in there to support them. \n\nYou are 100% NTA here in this situation.

Although I had only just graduated I was so excited to start a family with him. \n\nWhen I told him the news he initially seemed excited but as time went on he grew less and less interested with me and our child.\n\nTwo months into my pregnancy I broke things off with him for two reasons:\n\n1: He was not paying hardly any attention to me. He spent the majority of his free time with his friends and I started to feel like I was no longer a priority to him.\n\n2: He started drinking. He would have a drink here and there but he was never a heavy drinker. He would come home wasted and it was honestly annoying. Taking care of myself was hard enough and taking care of myself and my drunk boyfriend was too much.\n\nTo my knowledge he didn\u2019t take our breakup very hard and I was glad. We decided to stay friends in order to give our child the best life possible. I grew up without my father and that\u2019s the last thing I wanted for my baby.\n\nAbout a month later I met a really nice guy. We hit it off immediately and started dating not too long after that.

I now have a healthy nest egg and am saving and investing along with that. \n\nThen last month they told me I have to pay for my sister\u2019s schooling which was 62k. I don\u2019t think that fair because they only gave me 37k for my schooling and never told them I had to pay them back or pay for my sister at all. They won\u2019t admit it but I think they lost a lot money when my dad was stock trading and doing risky investments since they sold their house right afterwards, saying they wanted to downsize. They also got super bitter and weird with money around our relatives including picking a fight with my uncle who was always wealthy. No one would tell my sister or I what the fight was about but now I assume it\u2019s because my parents lost most of their money and is angry my uncle wouldn\u2019t help. All my cousins had their tuitions paid so it\u2019s embarrassing my sister wouldn\u2019t as well which is my parents are insisting I pay it.\n\nI told them and my sister I would give back 19k which was half the amount for my schooling so it would be like the 37k was split between us. They argued with me that I should be paying for her full schooling as my parents did for me but I don\u2019t think that fair as I\u2019d rather have had 37k in debt to deal with than 62k in debt especially when this was sprung up on me. I told them either take the 19k as half my tuition payment or I wasn\u2019t going to discuss it with them again. \n\nThey then called my bf to accuse him of influencing me to be greedy with my own family when I should be paying for my sister\u2019s full tuition amount. I was furious and told them they accepted the 19k and agreed to never bring up my sister\u2019s loan with me again or I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with this anymore and wouldn\u2019t invite them to the wedding. My mom yelled at me and told me I was an embarrassment to the family.\n\nMy sister came back alone and told me she would take the 19k and have it be enough. I told her she had to tell me in front of our parents that she would accept the 19k and she retracted what she said saying she wasn\u2019t going to do that.

I was able to save up for a house and now 4 years out of school I was able to buy my own condo and my bf and I are planning to get married so I\u2019ve been saving for that. I now have a healthy nest egg and am saving and investing along with that. \n\nThen last month they told me I have to pay for my sister\u2019s schooling which was 62k. I don\u2019t think that fair because they only gave me 37k for my schooling and never told them I had to pay them back or pay for my sister at all. They won\u2019t admit it but I think they lost a lot money when my dad was stock trading and doing risky investments since they sold their house right afterwards, saying they wanted to downsize. They also got super bitter and weird with money around our relatives including picking a fight with my uncle who was always wealthy. No one would tell my sister or I what the fight was about but now I assume it\u2019s because my parents lost most of their money and is angry my uncle wouldn\u2019t help. All my cousins had their tuitions paid so it\u2019s embarrassing my sister wouldn\u2019t as well which is my parents are insisting I pay it.\n\nI told them and my sister I would give back 19k which was half the amount for my schooling so it would be like the 37k was split between us. They argued with me that I should be paying for her full schooling as my parents did for me but I don\u2019t think that fair as I\u2019d rather have had 37k in debt to deal with than 62k in debt especially when this was sprung up on me. I told them either take the 19k as half my tuition payment or I wasn\u2019t going to discuss it with them again. \n\nThey then called my bf to accuse him of influencing me to be greedy with my own family when I should be paying for my sister\u2019s full tuition amount. I was furious and told them they accepted the 19k and agreed to never bring up my sister\u2019s loan with me again or I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with this anymore and wouldn\u2019t invite them to the wedding. My mom yelled at me and told me I was an embarrassment to the family.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A few years ago she went through a horrible break up after 8 years of dating the same dysfunctional guy which left her with nothing but 5 figure credit card debt. When it first happened we were very sympathetic and invited her to hangout with us for a week since we live about 600 miles away. We paid for her going out with us happily, knowing what she was going through. She offered to pay us back and we declined to take her money. My husband and I are both financially literate so when she felt better we went out of our way to help her renegotiate and settle her credit card debts and worked through an entire financial plan with her so she could start to build her retirement nest of eggs. As time goes by, cousin started doing better: she got a much better job in management, and started dating her new, financially secure man (6 figure white collar job and a paid-off house) with the intent to marry.\n\nFast forward to recent months: we just welcomed our first child in April, and sent around our registry at least 3 months ahead of time. We did not have a crazy registry: we have about 30-40 items listed, including some $8-20 stuff like baby towels and books because to us its the thoughts that counted and we made major purchases like car seat and baby furnitures ourselves. However, our registry was ignored by cousin - and she was notably the only family member on either side who didnt do anything with the registry.\n\nAs of a week ago, we received said cousin's wedding registry and I told my husband I did not want to contribute because gift giving seemed to be only one-way in this relationship. My husband was not happy and called me a petty AH \"over $25 baby gifts\" and said I should get over it or forget that his cousin didnt contribute because it is not significant and our baby has everything he might need. He further said for us to not contribute to her wedding registry would be ruining a life-long, sibling like relationship that is so precious. AITA?\n\nETA:  Thank you everyone for your input. It is certainly helpful to hear both YAH and NAH views... and further more, suggestions on what else could have happened (an off-registry gift was sent and lost in the holiday/post-holiday logistics nightmare). I think for my sanity, choosing to believe it is a lost gift is my best way forward here.\n\nETA2: My husband has apologized for calling me petty... since the wedding event is a good few months away, we might take a break and return to this to hash out what we want to do as a family unit. Also, pandemic might change the nature of the wedding event... so most likely, especially if there is no wedding + reception in the traditional sense, we will be flexible towards the newly wed's arrangement but only bring a small gift if we go physically. Thank you again everyone for your views.

So my husband and I have separate chores that we've taken on in our relationship and part of mine has always been cleaning the bathrooms. He's never picked up a toilet brush in his life, and I'm usually perfectly fine with doing my part. I cleaned it before we left for dinner tonight and all was well. After dinner, something didn't agree with him and he spent a good 30 minutes in the bathroom (although I could hear him in there playing on his phone for a while). Later, when I went to use it myself, I found that it was destroyed in a way I'm struggling to describe. Dried crap was splattered all over the bowel, all over the bottom of the seat, it was BAD, like I actually gagged. And I had just cleaned it before we left, so I was especially pissed that he'd made no effort to correct the situation.\n\nWhen I told him I was grossed out, he pretended that he didn't know he'd left it that way, which didn't make sense because he has eyes. I said that he needs to clean it, no way am I doing it, especially since I'd just done it hours before. He said so what I'd just done it, that bathroom is my job. He then said that he'd just bought me dinner, and me refusing to clean up his mess made me ungrateful (although he's just come back from a 3 week vacation and I took care of our two kids by myself and the dinner was supposed to be a thank you for that). Things escalated and ended by him shouting \"if you don't clean it that will show me who you really are\" and I don't even know what that means. All I know is I feel like if the situation were reversed, I wouldn't have left such a mess for him and told him it's his problem to deal with.\n\nSo AITA for not doing a chore I would normally do because of this specific situation? I acknowledge the this is normally my job, but I feel like this is NOT a normal situation!\n\nEDIT: so after reading all the comments and thinking over my husband's patterns of behavior, I have a bigger problem than just a nuclear explosion in the toilet. This is the same man who wanted me to make sure me and the kids didn't get Covid because it would ruin his 3 week trip (not because we could like, DIE, or anything). The same person when he saw me clearly grieving over the loss of a dear friend to covid, called it a buzzkill because I wasn't in the mood for sex. AND the kicker was when he called my dear friend a moron for not getting vaccinated and therefore kind of deserved what he got (my friend left behind 4 little girls who I guess don't deserve a dad?). All this is just a month's worth of incidents where I'm slowly starting to wake up to the fact that's he not really a good person. it's gotten progressively worse in the last month and I'm really not sure who I married anymore.\n\nThis morning the first thing he said to me when he got up (at noon) was \"So are you finally ready to apologize for your behavior last night?\" No, but I am ready to move myself into the guest room (which is close to the toilet that is still usable). There's some changes coming and I can't believe I didn't see this relationship for what it was until a bunch of strangers told me what was up.

I tell him he's a dirty fucking theirf and I got his license plate, I'm calling the cops unless he pays. He walks in acting all tough yelling at me. He puts a 50 on the counter and I put it in. He told me he took 3, 4 dollar sandwiches. I tell him to get the fuck out of the store. He's demanding his change back, I tell him to leave. He says he knows the law what I'm doing is illegal,I tell him to call the cops then. He is acting all tough and gangster but it's pretty cringe and not intimidating, he looks to be in his 30s. He eventually walks out and tries to knock over a crate of beer but fails. \n\nI checked the cameras and found out he actually took 5 of those sandwiches and stole a bottle of tequila as well. I still gained 15 dollars from him, but if I gave him the correct change I would've lost money which is part of the reason why I didn't give him his change back, I was certain he stole something else.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My in laws, well more MIL, have a good friend named \"Mike\" and due to a work commitment my husband had to leave a day early and MIL agreed to give us a ride home (4 hour drive) We ended up in the car with MIL and Mike and FIL drove the other car with SIL and her kids.\n\nI really don't like Mike due to some past interactions, so I was a little on edge. Him and MIL were joking around and the conversation got kind of racist, which I had an issue with. I asked him to stop saying racist things with kids in the car and Mike lost his shit. He said he was not going to have some white girl telling him what to say. He yelled at me about American imperialism and not \"needing to be educated\" and then he pulled off the highway, into a parking lot and told me to get out. MIL asked him to reconsider and he said he would if I apologized. I wasn't going to apologize and set the precedent for my kids that racism is ok, so I got out. I asked MIL if she was coming and she said no, not her problem.\n\nI was shocked and asked if she was really going to stay in the car with him. MIL shrugged and they left. I called an uber which was super expensive and my husband was furious and demanded MIL pay the uber bill. She refused and I said she is a shit grandmother (she honestly is) and she should have gotten out of the car with her family. She called me a dumbass and we currently aren't speaking. Some people think I was TA because it wasn't her fight and I expected too much.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
