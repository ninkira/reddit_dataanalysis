[{"title": "AITA for refusing to give my food to my little niece ?", "content": "My brother Martin (M 36) and his wife Lea (F 32) have a daughter (F 5) Ivy. I have huge problem with food, I am lactose and gluten intolerant and also I am on diet because I have diabetes. \n\nWell, we celebrated my grandpa's (M 75) b-day last weekend and the party included small family circle about 12 people. My grandma cooked lunch and I baked cake and prepared some snack. I also prepared small plate of food for myself and my mum brought me one portion gluten/lactose/sugar free cake. \n\nSo we had a lunch and we put the snack on the table and started to cut the cake and I set mine on plate aside. We were talking laughing and Ivy was running around the table and picking everything she wanted.\n\nShe was picking from my plate of stuff suitable for me, so I took it aside and where she couldn't reach it. She forgot it quite quickly.\n\nWell the problem started when she noticed my cake  has small rose on the top. So she took a fork and started to eat it. I told her I can cut her her own piece of cake from my grandpa's cake but she wanted mine. I told her she cannot have it and she run away crying and went to Lea. Lea came to me and ask me if I could give her the cake and I explained why I couldn't do it. I went to the toilet and when I came back I found Ivy sitting on my brother's lap and him feeding her my cake. I was fuming and told him, she ate my only piece of cake and I have almost nothing left. I was pissed because I told them no and Ieft to the kitchen. Lea followed me and told me to stop making drama out of piece of cake and that I m fucking up the party. She also told me she saw me taking my plate away from Ivy and that I am selfish jerk. \n\nMy mum defended me, but my brother told me I am an asshole because Ivy is small child. So AITA?\n\n\nEdit: the rose couldn't be removed from the cake, it was literally painted on it\n\nThere were 2 cakes. 1. Big 2 floor red velvet for my grandpa because he does not like gluten free cakes. 2. Small expensive one piece cake (15$ per piece) that my mum went to pick up to another town for me. Hope it's clear now.\n\nFuck*n edited to fucking since it's obviously bothering.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "AngelniLT", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 15251, "comment_karma": 9659, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 9901.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p8t71c/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_food_to_my_little/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 69, "NTA": 47, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 22}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am not on the lease and the utilities are in my boyfriend\u2019s name. We have a 2 bedroom apartment \u2013 the second bedroom used as a combo home office (for me) and music studio (for him).  Then 3 weeks ago his brother moved in. I came home from a weekend trip with my sister and found him there \u2013 no discussion beforehand. I was pissed. My BF swore it was for a week at most until his brother oved in with a friend. So he spent a week on the living room couch.\n\nWell, to no one\u2019s surprise that didn\u2019t happen. The friend decided he didn\u2019t want the brother to move in. Given that the brother doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t clean up after himself and is a general jerk (even my boyfriend admits this about his brother) \u2013 I can\u2019t say I blame the friend. My BF says he can\u2019t kick his brother out when he has no place to go and begged me to give him a couple of months (I had started packing my things). I reluctantly agreed and BF ends up moving my desk into the living room where I have no privacy while I work and his music stuff into a corner of the bedroom where we are basically tripping over it so his brother can have a bedroom. I told BF he has 2 months to get his brother out or I would move out.\n\nIt gets to the time of the month for me to send money to my BF for bills. I send him 25% of the rent and 33% of the utilities instead of 50% for both. BF is upset \u2013 saying that is not what we agreed. I told him I also didn\u2019t agree to live with his brother \u2013 and I\u2019m paying what I feel is fair given that. My thinking is that every apartment I have shared \u2013 you pay rent by bedroom and utilities by person. BF starts freaking out saying that he can\u2019t afford that and that I agreed to his brother staying. I told him that I agreed to not move out \u2013 I did not agree to financially support his brother. He told me that I can\u2019t just change our agreement and I pointed out that he had when he added a third person to the apartment. BF insists he doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay that much (he is short on money and his old roommate moving out is one of the big reasons I moved in). BF says that he will end up having to not pay something and that it will kill his credit which he has been working on rebuilding. He tells me that he is already short because he is having to spend more money on groceries with his brother there (I flatly refused to pay for more groceries). I am refusing to budge.\n\nBF insists that I am trying to hurt him financially because I am angry with him and being petty. I am angry and I know that I can make bad decisions when I am mad. However thinking about it \u2013 I don\u2019t think I should have to support his brother. Living with 2 other people should cost less than living with 1 other person. However I am doubting my own judgment. Am I being petty out of anger? AITA for not paying 50% of the rent?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nThis has come up many times -why didn't I tell BF ahead of time that I wasn't going to pay 50% as normal.  The answer is that I never thought about money until I went to transfer him money for the monthly bills.  That was the first time I realized that I would be financially supporting the brother if I kept paying 50% and I decided I wasn't going to do it.

I think youve got these mixed up. You by no means agreed to paying for the brother when you agreed to let him live there, but, to be in a healthy relationship (romantic or just with other people in general) you then needed to bring up your complaints about rent.

As a desperate last resort my uncle reached out to the extended family for financial assistance. Despite being in a position to help, I refuse to, because when the situation was reversed 15 years ago, my uncle chose to do nothing.\n\n**15 years ago \u2014 My family's brush with poverty.**\n\nFifteen years ago my family suffered a series of unfortunate events that forced us on the edge of poverty. Fortunately, through the generosity of our extended family, we managed to make it through to the other end (if just barely). This generosity meant that much more considering that most of my extended family themselves suffered from financial hardship.\n\nThe exception is my uncle. At the time he was several years into his career as an engineer at one of the top engineering firms, and yet entirely ignored my family's plight. While my family struggled, Jeff was flaunting his six figure BMW. Which is his right, of course. Though I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel some resentment, but I understand that this resentment stemmed from a place of entitlement.\n\n**Today \u2014 My uncle's bid for financial assistance**\n\nFast forward 15 years and fortunately my family are in a much better off. I've since graduated, almost a decade into my career, and am in the fortuitous position of being able to ensure that my family never has to worry about money ever again.\n\nIn those same 15 years my uncle has founded his own engineering firm, and was wildly successful until the pandemic forced his business into involuntary administration. The situation is now dire enough that several months ago my uncle begun asking the extended family for financial assistance.\n\nBut what he needed was beyond what the extended family could provided, though the extended family did do the best that they could. I've thus far kept silent. Unfortunately that silence has not gone by unnoticed.\n\n**Am I the asshole?**\n\nMy uncle called me earlier today asking for a $10,000 loan to keep his son enrolled in his son's private school. He tried to sell me some sob story about how disruptive it would be to my cousin's development if he would be forced to change schools in this \"pivotal development period\".\n\nFrankly, I don't see how any of that is my problem. Had my uncle supported my family when we asked him for it, I would have gone to the moon and back for him \u2014 as I have done for the members of my extended family that did help my family.

He said I hadn't spent as much as I usually do, that I financially treated my bio niece/nephew different to my step nieces/nephews and that the birthday gift showed that.

He asked what kind of stunt it was and how could I be so cruel to someone who was grieving. I told him she had wanted me to give her the letter, that she wrote it and wanted our stepmom to know.

She'd had cancer for almost 2 years. She knew she was dying and before it happened she wrote a letter telling our stepmom she had never loved her, never wanted her around and that she was not welcome at her funeral as well as other stuff my sister didn't tell me about. I knew the idea of the letter was to let our stepmom know she had never grown to love her. She asked me to give it to her before she died and I did what she asked. I heard nothing about the letter for months. Neither my dad or stepmom showed up to the funeral and my dad was talking to me like normal.\n\nThen a month ago he confronted me over it. He asked what kind of stunt it was and how could I be so cruel to someone who was grieving. I told him she had wanted me to give her the letter, that she wrote it and wanted our stepmom to know. I think he was shocked because he seemed to think I wrote the letter or something, or maybe our mom since she and our stepmom always hated each others guts. My dad was really upset and asked had she always felt that way. I said yeah. He stopped the conversation and went back to his place and it was a week after when he and my stepmom said I was a cruel bastard for doing that to them. That I should have burned the letter and let my sisters last words to my stepmom be something else.\n\nMy dad told me he was done with me. That I had broken his wife's heart, that I had trampled on 13 years of being our stepmom all to help my sisters bitterness be the thing that lived on instead of something else,\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your sister resented that and the fact that he did not protect sister became the cause of the friction between dad and sister.

She offered to pay for it since she was proud of my husband for doing what was best for our son, at first we said no because it didn't felt right, but my MIL convinced us saying that she didn't wanted to miss the wedding just as his husband did if we ended up taking too long.\n\nWe made it small and simple because we didn't wanted to take advantage of her and we even let my MIL have her way in some decisions. When the big day came, she's Mindy by her side and my husband and I are confused, my MIL approached us and we asked her what was happening, she said that she'd invited her to the wedding because it was a special day, my husband said that yes, it was a special day for us and that Mindy had no business being there and would appreciate if she left, my MIL looked at me and I said that I would rather that too, but my MIL got angry and said that she paid for the wedding and she could invite anyone she wanted, while we both agree, we said that Mindy wasn't really ''anyone'' and that it was the fact that she didn't told us before rather that inviting her. \n\nShe said that if Mindy had to go she'll follow and my husband said ''then do''. She ended up saying that she's gonna stay but that we had to tell Mindy to leave which my husband gladly did and my MIL spent all the evening mad, after the wedding we offered to pay for half of it or even everything if she wanted but she said that the damaged was already done.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My brother helps out financially but he lives further away so he\u2019s not here for the day to day. I like his girlfriend of 2 years a lot but she really does not understand the severity of the situation or even the particulars. She\u2019s tries to give advice that honestly doesn\u2019t apply or are things we or the doctors try. Which wouldn\u2019t be an issue, he\u2019s not her responsibility. However, sometimes I just want to talk to my brother about it alone so we can have a conversation without having to stop every 5 seconds as she derails and compares it to her own father\u2019s illness or another event. Plus, sometimes it\u2019s just nice to talk to my brother alone. Not every time, but just\u2026sometimes. The issue is every time I call or FaceTime him, she appears and starts interjecting. I\u2019ve tried talking to my brother about it and he agrees with me, but says she\u2019s sensitive and doesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings.\n\nThe other day, I FaceTimed my brother to discuss a serious issue regarding our father potentially needing a nurse and all the paperwork behind that, the people we need to talk to, etc. The minute he answered, I saw his girlfriend on the screen. I politely said hello and then asked if I could talk to my brother alone. She asked why and I said it was regarding some serious stuff with our dad. She said she could help and I said it\u2019s a private matter, that really just pertains to the two of us. My brother said he would go in the other room and he did. Everything was going fine and we were working it out. Halfway through, his girlfriend came in the room to ask him something. He answered and asked her to shut the door on her way out. She lingered. I stopped what we were discussing and said again we had a lot to work out. She offered to help and my brother told her it wasn\u2019t necessary. She then saw what my brother was looking at and started talking about something that wasn\u2019t helpful or relevant. I interrupted and said \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re doing, but we already have a plan. We really need to finish this. It\u2019s nothing personal, I\u2019d love to talk to you later.\u201d She started making excuses and I said sometimes I\u2019d like to talk to my brother alone. She ended up leaving and we finished sorting it out, and hung up.\n\nMy brother say she\u2019s hurt and upset. I texted her to apologize but also added I was keeping the boundary that sometimes I will need to speak with my brother without her hovering. She said that she\u2019s in his life, nothing\u2019s a secret. I said I don\u2019t expect secrets, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell her, but for a few minutes, can I just talk with him alone?

My brother helps out financially but he lives further away so he\u2019s not here for the day to day. I like his girlfriend of 2 years a lot but she really does not understand the severity of the situation or even the particulars. She\u2019s tries to give advice that honestly doesn\u2019t apply or are things we or the doctors try. Which wouldn\u2019t be an issue, he\u2019s not her responsibility. However, sometimes I just want to talk to my brother about it alone so we can have a conversation without having to stop every 5 seconds as she derails and compares it to her own father\u2019s illness or another event. Plus, sometimes it\u2019s just nice to talk to my brother alone. Not every time, but just\u2026sometimes. The issue is every time I call or FaceTime him, she appears and starts interjecting. I\u2019ve tried talking to my brother about it and he agrees with me, but says she\u2019s sensitive and doesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings.\n\nThe other day, I FaceTimed my brother to discuss a serious issue regarding our father potentially needing a nurse and all the paperwork behind that, the people we need to talk to, etc. The minute he answered, I saw his girlfriend on the screen. I politely said hello and then asked if I could talk to my brother alone. She asked why and I said it was regarding some serious stuff with our dad. She said she could help and I said it\u2019s a private matter, that really just pertains to the two of us. My brother said he would go in the other room and he did. Everything was going fine and we were working it out. Halfway through, his girlfriend came in the room to ask him something. He answered and asked her to shut the door on her way out. She lingered. I stopped what we were discussing and said again we had a lot to work out. She offered to help and my brother told her it wasn\u2019t necessary. She then saw what my brother was looking at and started talking about something that wasn\u2019t helpful or relevant. I interrupted and said \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re doing, but we already have a plan. We really need to finish this. It\u2019s nothing personal, I\u2019d love to talk to you later.\u201d She started making excuses and I said sometimes I\u2019d like to talk to my brother alone. She ended up leaving and we finished sorting it out, and hung up.\n\nMy brother say she\u2019s hurt and upset. I texted her to apologize but also added I was keeping the boundary that sometimes I will need to speak with my brother without her hovering. She said that she\u2019s in his life, nothing\u2019s a secret. I said I don\u2019t expect secrets, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell her, but for a few minutes, can I just talk with him alone? I can\u2019t ever have quality time with him because she\u2019s with him? \n\nAm I being an ass?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a smaller, cheaper wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I want to buy a home in the next year or two and we want the money that could go on a wedding to go on savings for a home together. We're only doing a single bridesmaid/groomsman each. No flower girls or page boys or anything of the sort. Nobody had any issue with this.\n\nThen my niece was excluded from her uncle's wedding in May. So my sister is her mom. My sisters husband/niece's dad comes from a blended family and his half brother chose to include all the kids in the family except my niece who is 6. 8 kids total were included, were flower girls and page boys, but my niece wasn't. They didn't know until they showed up at the wedding. My niece was really upset because the other kids also got a fun day out with the couple as a treat for being in the wedding. My sister and her husband were heartbroken and furious at the same time and cut them out.\n\nNow my sister wants me to make up for it by making a flower girl role for her and giving her that experience. She wants me to pay and says it's not a big expense. But my fianc\u00e9 has a niece and we'd have to include her too so she's not snubbed. And that's more money on us. Money we can't afford to put into the wedding. Not to mention if she wants me to make the role I have a feeling the next thing will be the fun experience. I told her I could not stretch the budget to make it work. She told me it's one expense to make my niece's year and to help make up for the asshole move her in-law's made. She told me a good aunt would do this. That I should think about my niece instead of our budget.\n\nAITA for saying no?\n\nMy sister is furious I am sticking to my no. She thinks I'm making things so much worse. And while I am heartbroken for my niece I just can't spend more money. We had every penny accounted for and now my sister is asking for this. I feel so bad though.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Before we got married, nearly a decade ago, my wife was dating a distant colleague of ours, \"John.\" Their relationship lasted a six months and the breakup was messy. John is utterly brilliant, but he has the neediness of a child. He frequently pestered my wife for \"closure\" after they broke up, even though my wife says the relationship wasn't that serious, and she was uninterested in talking to him. While John was polite to me after my wife and I got together, some of the messages he left for her indicate that he thinks she chose me for my money. (That isn't true).\n\nEventually, John found work in a neighboring city. His attempts to contact my wife became less frequent, and stopped completely a few years ago. She made a point to ignore/block all his calls and messages so as not to encourage him.\n\nRecently, John published some research relating to a current project of mine. I thought it wouldn't hurt to reach out to him and ask for a (socially-distanced) lunch outing, and he could decline if he was uncomfortable. As stated above, John is brilliant, and I really wanted to hear his thoughts on a topic we're both researching. I thought it would be a good opportunity to rebuild a bridge. I complimented his recent work and offered to pay for lunch. He offered nice words in return and agreed to meet me at a caf\u00e9 in the city where I work, which is about two hours away from where he works now.\n\nOn the day of our lunch meeting, my wife decided to join us. She and I found a table at the caf\u00e9 and waited for John. When he arrived, he saw us sitting together, turned around, got back in his car, and drove off.\n\nAfter this happened, I emailed John and told him I was disappointed. He responded by saying that it was rude of me to bring additional guests to lunch without letting him know ahead of time, especially since he drove two hours each way. My wife thinks now that John is still in love with her. According to his social media, he's 40 and unmarried. My wife says that, if he is in love with her still, then we definitely fucked up.

Before we got married, nearly a decade ago, my wife was dating a distant colleague of ours, \"John.\" Their relationship lasted a six months and the breakup was messy. John is utterly brilliant, but he has the neediness of a child. He frequently pestered my wife for \"closure\" after they broke up, even though my wife says the relationship wasn't that serious, and she was uninterested in talking to him. While John was polite to me after my wife and I got together, some of the messages he left for her indicate that he thinks she chose me for my money. (That isn't true).\n\nEventually, John found work in a neighboring city. His attempts to contact my wife became less frequent, and stopped completely a few years ago. She made a point to ignore/block all his calls and messages so as not to encourage him.\n\nRecently, John published some research relating to a current project of mine. I thought it wouldn't hurt to reach out to him and ask for a (socially-distanced) lunch outing, and he could decline if he was uncomfortable. As stated above, John is brilliant, and I really wanted to hear his thoughts on a topic we're both researching. I thought it would be a good opportunity to rebuild a bridge. I complimented his recent work and offered to pay for lunch. He offered nice words in return and agreed to meet me at a caf\u00e9 in the city where I work, which is about two hours away from where he works now.\n\nOn the day of our lunch meeting, my wife decided to join us. She and I found a table at the caf\u00e9 and waited for John. When he arrived, he saw us sitting together, turned around, got back in his car, and drove off.\n\nAfter this happened, I emailed John and told him I was disappointed. He responded by saying that it was rude of me to bring additional guests to lunch without letting him know ahead of time, especially since he drove two hours each way. My wife thinks now that John is still in love with her. According to his social media, he's 40 and unmarried. My wife says that, if he is in love with her still, then we definitely fucked up. But it's been a decade and, personally, I think he should be over it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It exists, it affects millions of parents and children around the world and it is something that you absolutely cannot just \"train\" out of someone. It's a neurological condition that affects you permanently. You want your kid to not have autism? Brain transplant. Simple as that.

Heck, I'm only a failure because I became a hateful shrew, but you, OP, I'm sure you're compassionate and supportive toward your son, and if he continues to do his best he will absolutely become a fantastic human being.\n\nCut these toxic relatives out of your life, if you ask me. They have no place in dictating what you can say around your son if they well and truly believe autism is merely a myth, and they do not at all deserve to be near your beloved child if they are going to continue with this outrageous attitude.\n\nEDIT: So talking about this with my own mother (lovely woman as far as autism is concerned, always keeps updated on news regarding it), not only does she agree that you're not in the wrong but that you should give yourself a pat on the back for being a FANTASTIC parent to your son.

Especially be wary of programs that claim they can train kids not to be autistic.  That isn't a thing and the training can cross the line into abusive.  Additionally, people (and autistic kids are people) aren't that simple.  \n\nA good example of this is eye contact.  Neurological people find eye contact important.  Many autistic people find it very uncomfortable if not painful.  Forcing eye contact means you're forcing the child to be uncomfortable.  Additionally, autistic kids often can't process information from eye contact and verbal information at the same time. You need to choose - eye contact or listening.  You can't have both. \n\nAnother example is stimming. Stim behavior is something that people do to meet a need.  My not having the same need doesn't make it less of a need.    Physically stopping people from stimming is done by physically preventing it.  Often called behavioral training.  Also abusive.  It is ok to try to replace inappropriate self stim behavior with appropriate ones.  I have had the private vs public  conversation too.\n\nSide note: newer research shows that echolalia and scripting are how some autistic kids learn language. It's a different language acquisition but still valid.

Imagine talking to people and having everyone around you hating you, isolating you because you say weird things that sound logical to you but are socially awkward. That is just a glimpse of what it is like to carry autism and not knowing. You just feel like you are a broken human being that is not working right. All of that goes away if you know how your brain works and your family respects who you actually are.\n  \nJust make sure it is not perceived as a \"problem\" by your child. Lots of people carry autism, just like lots of people are tall or small. There is nothing abnormal about it. It is not a problem, it is just a distinctive trait that will give challenges, true, but will also give him superpowers. He'll probably turn out to be a greater than usual mathematician with very high IQ, for instance. If you frame autism as an issue with your kid that needs solving, then by talking about it again and again, it will become a problem engrained in his brain for him and it will scar him for life. Autism is a superpower. Make your kid love being on the spectrum and not want to be any different.  \n  \nGood luck.", "rating": "NTA - Not the asshole", "user_reports": [], "mod_reports": [], "score": 1, "comment_ups": 1}, {"index": 76, "author": "Greeeeeeeenie", "content": "\u2026 NTA what the fuck.

Things are a bit heated in the household at the moment and I wanted to get an outside opinion.\n\nSome relevant backstory: I moved from South Africa to the UK with my mom when I was 14. My dad still lives in South Africa, but we are still very close. He's had a girlfriend for the past 8 months, and they now live together with her 10 year old daughter. To be completely open, before this took place I wasn't her biggest fan. Apparently all of her exes were 'crazy', and she's in an MLM that makes her enough to pay a quarter of the rent. My dad, who is not wealthy, is expected to pay the rest along with household bills, her daughters school fees etc.\n\nSo, to the case in question. I decided to surprise my dad with a getaway next weekend for us to stay in a game reserve that he's always wanted to go to. I bought one 'hut' with two single beds, with the assumption that it would make for a good dad-daughter bonding trip.\n\nHis girlfriend is furious with this, as it is something she would be interested in too. She called me selfish, said that she couldn't afford to go and that it should be no big deal for me to book a second hut as I'm on a 'UK salary'. Being honest, I could afford it (although I'd have to scrimp the rest of the month). I was taken aback and told her that if she'd had a real job and didn't have to rely on any man in her life to pay for everything, maybe she could afford to get one for her &amp; her daughter. She promptly stormed off and has been in their bedroom ever since.\n\nMy dad ultimately understood where I was coming from, but said it was a bit harsh on her.

Things are a bit heated in the household at the moment and I wanted to get an outside opinion.\n\nSome relevant backstory: I moved from South Africa to the UK with my mom when I was 14. My dad still lives in South Africa, but we are still very close. He's had a girlfriend for the past 8 months, and they now live together with her 10 year old daughter. To be completely open, before this took place I wasn't her biggest fan. Apparently all of her exes were 'crazy', and she's in an MLM that makes her enough to pay a quarter of the rent. My dad, who is not wealthy, is expected to pay the rest along with household bills, her daughters school fees etc.\n\nSo, to the case in question. I decided to surprise my dad with a getaway next weekend for us to stay in a game reserve that he's always wanted to go to. I bought one 'hut' with two single beds, with the assumption that it would make for a good dad-daughter bonding trip.\n\nHis girlfriend is furious with this, as it is something she would be interested in too. She called me selfish, said that she couldn't afford to go and that it should be no big deal for me to book a second hut as I'm on a 'UK salary'. Being honest, I could afford it (although I'd have to scrimp the rest of the month). I was taken aback and told her that if she'd had a real job and didn't have to rely on any man in her life to pay for everything, maybe she could afford to get one for her &amp; her daughter. She promptly stormed off and has been in their bedroom ever since.\n\nMy dad ultimately understood where I was coming from, but said it was a bit harsh on her. I think it was justified, and that telling someone she met a week ago to pay for her trip is rude.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She asked once again this morning and I held my ground with a solid no. She did call me a bad sister, but I told her no means no and then we had to leave. The car ride I just blasted my music and we had light chats, but the dress was not mentioned again. Before we left I made sure the dress was in my hiding spot and locked my door (you do have to have a key to unlock it) and it\u2019s still here. Dropped her off no problem with an I love you. \n\nI (20 F) am refusing to give my sister (24 F) my dress I bought a few days ago for her trip back to California.\n\nI bought this super cute dress off of a website about a week and a half ago and it showed up on Wednesday (August 18 2021) I tried it on and loved it. I went to show my sister and she instantly asked if she could have it. I said no and she again asked because she wanted to wear it to her friends engagement party out in California. I again said no. The dress was $200 and I bought it as a birthday gift for myself.\n\nThis morning (August 21 2021) she once again asked for the dress and even said she would buy it off of me, but I again said no. I really like the dress and I feel really trepidatious to give it to her at all. This is when she started yelling at me that I was a bitch and not a good sister because if it was her she would let me borrow her clothes.\n\nThe reason I am saying no is because I have given her my stuff in the past when she has asked to borrow it and it has either never been returned, come back stained or torn, or it has \"lost\". She has even sold my mothers 14K gold necklace that our great grandmother gave our mom. Knowing her past on how she never returns things or always ruins them I keep refusing.\n\nShe is calling me the worlds biggest bitch and saying that I am not a good sister because I wont give her something of mine. She is saying she has been working all week and that's why she couldn't buy anything for the party. I can see where she is coming from with this, but she has also known for over a month that she was going to be flying out to California so she has had more than enough time for this.\n\nI understand where she\u2019s coming from. She needs something to wear to California and she just wants to borrow it so I do know I seem like I\u2019m being rude for not letting her. \n\nI dislike being in fights with her, but I do not want to give in on this matter because I genuinely like the dress and have not had the opportunity to even wear it yet. I love my sister, but I cannot give her my dress when historically she has always lost or ruined the clothes especially since this one is so expensive. She is now even saying that she is not going to California because I wont give her my dress and is saying it is all my fault.\n\nEdit: She is leaving for California tomorrow morning (August 22) and my whole family is saying I am in the wrong for not letting her borrow the dress. It is really making me think that I am TA for just not letting her borrow it. \n\nSo Am I The Asshole?\n\nTLDR: I (20F) am not giving my sister (24F) my $200 dress (that I just got) for her trip to California when she has historically ruined my clothes or lost them before and she is now super mad at me and is saying she wont go to California because I am not giving her my dress.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "clickersmiles", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 336, "comment_karma": 56, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 1234.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p8vo3d/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_my_dress/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 140, "NTA": 97, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 43}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I went to show my sister and she instantly asked if she could have it. I said no and she again asked because she wanted to wear it to her friends engagement party out in California. I again said no. The dress was $200 and I bought it as a birthday gift for myself.\n\nThis morning (August 21 2021) she once again asked for the dress and even said she would buy it off of me, but I again said no. I really like the dress and I feel really trepidatious to give it to her at all. This is when she started yelling at me that I was a bitch and not a good sister because if it was her she would let me borrow her clothes.\n\nThe reason I am saying no is because I have given her my stuff in the past when she has asked to borrow it and it has either never been returned, come back stained or torn, or it has \"lost\". She has even sold my mothers 14K gold necklace that our great grandmother gave our mom. Knowing her past on how she never returns things or always ruins them I keep refusing.\n\nShe is calling me the worlds biggest bitch and saying that I am not a good sister because I wont give her something of mine. She is saying she has been working all week and that's why she couldn't buy anything for the party. I can see where she is coming from with this, but she has also known for over a month that she was going to be flying out to California so she has had more than enough time for this.\n\nI understand where she\u2019s coming from. She needs something to wear to California and she just wants to borrow it so I do know I seem like I\u2019m being rude for not letting her. \n\nI dislike being in fights with her, but I do not want to give in on this matter because I genuinely like the dress and have not had the opportunity to even wear it yet. I love my sister, but I cannot give her my dress when historically she has always lost or ruined the clothes especially since this one is so expensive. She is now even saying that she is not going to California because I wont give her my dress and is saying it is all my fault.\n\nSo Am I The Asshole?\n\nTLDR: I (20F) am not giving my sister (24F) my $200 dress (that I just got) for her trip to California when she has historically ruined my clothes or lost them before and she is now super mad at me and is saying she wont go to California because I am not giving her my dress.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It'll ruin pictures and distract from the bride.\" I feel like a complete asshole by not even considering it.

I told her she needed to apologize to him right now, or leave. She said I'd been babying him and I didn't know how to raise a son. I snapped back \"I'm not taking advice on raising a son or toilet issues from you. I had to wash your son's underwear when he were married so I know you didn't do a good job.\"\n\nShe left without apologizing to my son.

We instead used a bed liner but obviously my sheets and pants would still get soaked. Your solution is way better.\n\nHere are a couple of ways to help as well: don\u2019t let him drink anything an hour and a half before bed. Then tell him if he both uses the bathroom before going to sleep AND doesn\u2019t wet the bed after x number of nights (choose what is reasonable for his bedwetting frequency) you\u2019ll give him a surprise. If you can afford it than do like $1/$2 per however many nights you chose and after a month he gets to spend it on anything he wants. However if he wets the bed you\u2019ll subtract twice as much. You can introduce this to him after he goes a few nights without wetting and say \u201cthat\u2019s great! I have an idea since you\u2019re saving me money on the undies why don\u2019t we\u2026.\u201d That way he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re doing it to push him out of bedwetting.\n\nAnother method is to encourage him to set an alarm in the middle of the night (1/2 AM) to use the bathroom.

We have been married for a while now. From the start it was pretty much me handling our finances, bills, groceries, even some of our wedding costs. I once even volunteered to pay his rent of 3 months(he lived with his brothers) and paid a few thousand of his loans too. The past year I have been managing everything from bills to rent to groceries, with him occasionally contributing to the rent. The problem with him is that his family used to be loaded and then they hit rock bottom, long story short he\u2019s been used to that kind of life and spending and can\u2019t get out of it. He can\u2019t keep jobs and gets himself fired from pretty much every position. He has invested a lot of money(i had to sell some of my jewellery)in forex and lost every single penny and it all made our situation worse. I was sick of asking my family for money all the time, and was living pay check to pay check. Then I found out I was pregnant so I started saving up money on pretty much everything and made a secret bank account and I am pretty proud of how it looks rn. My husband doesn\u2019t know and he\u2019s recently left his most current job and we\u2019re practically living in poverty.

Not just offer. PROVIDE.** \n\nThe [PPCA](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/02/12/2014-03082/shared-responsibility-for-employers-regarding-health-coverage) regulations state that an employee's election of coverage from a prior year must continue for every succeeding plan year, unless the employee affirmatively elects to opt out of the plan.\n\n&gt; The final regulations clarify that an employee's election of coverage from a prior year that continues for every succeeding plan year unless the employee affirmatively elects to opt out of the plan constitutes an offer of coverage for purposes of section 4980H.\n\n&gt; 26 U.S. Code \u00a7 4980H - Shared responsibility for employers regarding health coverage\n\n**It's *actually illegal* to drop people's coverage and not renew the their health policy just because they did not reconfirm benefit selections during open enrollment.**\n\nThis is why if you opt out of your employer's health coverage, many companies will make you sign a waiver acknowledging that you are consciously doing so. I had to keep signing these at a previous company because I opted out due to having other insurance.\n\nThis is to cover the company's ass so they don't find themselves sued or fined into oblivion over accusations of noncompliance. It's in a company's best interest to receive a hard yes or no to coverage.\n\n**TL:DR;** If you find yourself in OP's situation, you have rights. Your company is hoping that you're not aware of those rights. GO HARASS HR UNTIL THEY REINSTATE YOUR PLAN TO MAKE YOU GO AWAY.\n\n~~** edit: Looks like it depends on the state? All the ones I've lived in have been pretty heavily regulated. I didn't realize there was such a huge difference in legislation.~~\n\n** another edit: Another commenter also confirmed this *is* a federal thing. I guess some companies don't actually give a fuck and expect either people will: \n\n1. Not fight them on it\n2. Leave the issue alone/not report if they allow the person to renew their coverage \n\nThere's a reason why company \"open enrollments\" are much longer than actually advertised.\n\nedit: This post went shiny.

Had a drunk one night stand then told her what happened. She decided she wanted to work on getting past this betrayal I committed. Two years later we got married, already had our son and daughter (twins). We didn\u2019t even make it our first year though when I found out the woman I slept with had my son we didn\u2019t know about. And that was too much for my ex and we divorced because I wanted to be part of my son\u2019s life. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years now. My ex and I keep it civil for the most part but don\u2019t interact much if we don\u2019t have to. And my kids get along great. My son adores my youngest and they really look up to him. The twins turned 6 a week ago. We had a party at my house to celebrate. Usually we do parties separately but since this year my ex doesn\u2019t have enough money for her own party she wanted to attend the one at my house.\n\nI told her that was fine but gave a heads up my son will be there. She hasn\u2019t seen him at all since we found out about him. My ex wasn\u2019t happy with that. She asked why was it necessary that he be there. I told her like it was obvious because he\u2019s our kids\u2019 brother and what kid doesn\u2019t want to go to a party? She asked me not to bring him because she\u2019d really like to be there for the twins. Didn\u2019t see that as fair to my son since he\u2019s already invited and what happened wasn\u2019t his fault. I told her she could come before his mom drops him off because he\u2019s supposed to spend the night with me after that (we were all gonna go to my parents house the next day). We got into a huge argument because she wants to be there for the kids but I wouldn\u2019t uninvited my son. \n\nShe didn\u2019t end up going. Got told off by her and my ex MIL. Because she wanted to be there for our kids but I wasn\u2019t considerate of how him being there would affect her. And that\u2019s why they think I was an asshole. For not keeping my son from going so that she could spend that time with the kids. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019ve tried to battle it as much as possible by offering him different foods, but it\u2019s so difficult when not every adult is on board. My partner, stepson\u2019s mother and my MIL (who watches stepson while everyones at work) are all picky eaters in some way. MIL and stepson\u2019s mother don\u2019t eat seafood, my partner has a whole list of foods he won\u2019t eat including most cooked vegetables and raw fruits. On the other hand, I grew up eating almost everything. \n\nThis morning, I made some strawberry pancakes for everyone and my stepson didn\u2019t want it. My partner tells me to make him something else instead. This is normally what happens every time we cook, he has to have separate meals made for him. I always make sure we have at least one safe food for him to eat for every meal but I told my partner that I am not going to make a completely separate meal just for him because it just solidifies his picky eating. That he can eat his safe food or if he\u2019s really hungry, eat what everyone else is eating. This is especially important to me because my 8 month old is eating solids now (baby led weaning) and I give her whatever I\u2019m eating in age appropriate pieces to avoid picky eating and I don\u2019t want her seeing her dad and brother and emulating then. \n\nMy partner was upset that I refused to cook a separate breakfast for him. I stand by my decision to not cook an additional meal and if it\u2019s that much of an issue, either stepson\u2019s mom or my partner needs to prepare his meals themselves to give to me. \n \nI do feel bad because I obviously don\u2019t want my kid to starve but I also don\u2019t want to encourage his picky eating. \n\n(And no, he does not have any kind of sensory issues. He just likes plain foods, sweets and basic fruits.)\n\nETA: I seem to have sparked some confusion with my use of the word \u201csafe food\u201d. I only meant that with every meal, I offer a dish that I know for certain he\u2019ll eat, like mashed potatoes, rice, corn on the cob, pasta.\n\nETA2: Yikes, I hit a lot of nerves with this one. My kid is 3. Our dinner table rule is he needs to take a bite out of everything on the plate. I try to expose him to as much foods as possible just like I do with my daughter. The other adults don\u2019t do this and he literally gets what he wants to eat every time he\u2019s with his mom and his grandma and even my SO when he\u2019s the one cooking. So when he\u2019s used to getting food like cheeseburgers, nuggets and fries or mac and cheese. he doesn\u2019t like eating vegetables or fish or even beef when he\u2019s here. And I guess picky may not have been the right word? I mean, he does eat different stuff when he\u2019s encouraged, but it\u2019s a battle. I\u2019m often sitting at the table feeding him myself. If it\u2019s not food he loves, he goes into \u201cno\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t want it\u201d mode.

I\u2019ve tried to battle it as much as possible by offering him different foods, but it\u2019s so difficult when not every adult is on board. My partner, stepson\u2019s mother and my MIL (who watches stepson while everyones at work) are all picky eaters in some way. MIL and stepson\u2019s mother don\u2019t eat seafood, my partner has a whole list of foods he won\u2019t eat including most cooked vegetables and raw fruits. On the other hand, I grew up eating almost everything. \n\nThis morning, I made some strawberry pancakes for everyone and my stepson didn\u2019t want it. My partner tells me to make him something else instead. This is normally what happens every time we cook, he has to have separate meals made for him. I always make sure we have at least one safe food for him to eat for every meal but I told my partner that I am not going to make a completely separate meal just for him because it just solidifies his picky eating. That he can eat his safe food or if he\u2019s really hungry, eat what everyone else is eating. This is especially important to me because my 8 month old is eating solids now (baby led weaning) and I give her whatever I\u2019m eating in age appropriate pieces to avoid picky eating and I don\u2019t want her seeing her dad and brother and emulating then. \n\nMy partner was upset that I refused to cook a separate breakfast for him.

I met my husband my senior year of high school (he was 22 and a freshman in college and I was 19, dating for 3 years married for 8) he knew about my spending habits so my husband, like the saint he is got a job at his dads company which he now runs. We are now very well off, but here\u2019s the catch, I am 8 months pregnant and my husband does not want me to spend thousands on our baby, he is very clear on how he doesn\u2019t want our baby to be spoiled and become dependent on us. I was upset at this because I want to give my baby the world, simply because we have the money. We live in the suburbs where everyone and their mama is spoiled rotten and I do not want to make my baby an outcast. We spent about 2k on my baby\u2019s bedroom alone and due to COVID and due to my fear of getting sick we did not hold any special events for my baby which saved us a fortune but I did end up spending about 1k on my baby\u2019s clothes, toys, bottles, formula and diapers. My husband was very upset when he learned I spent nearly 3k on my baby. I explained to him that being a new mother is expensive and we have the money to burn. He then told me that I shouldn\u2019t spoil my baby anymore and that \u201cIt\u2019s not even alive yet.\u201d I got very emotional just thinking about losing my baby, my husband comforted me and apologized for what he said and explain that he just wants our baby to have \u201cThe upbringing we did\u201d which wasn\u2019t even an \u201cupbringing\u201d for him, he grew up upper middle class and I grew up just above poverty.

(I have a really bad habit of spending money when it\u2019s unnecessary or I go a bit overboard) Ever since I was little I loved spending money, just my family never had a lot of it, as time grew I started spending money every chance I got some of it, birthdays, Christmas, etc. I started working at 15 working for a small bakery (which I now Co-own) to pay for my habit. I met my husband my senior year of high school (he was 22 and a freshman in college and I was 19, dating for 3 years married for 8) he knew about my spending habits so my husband, like the saint he is got a job at his dads company which he now runs. We are now very well off, but here\u2019s the catch, I am 8 months pregnant and my husband does not want me to spend thousands on our baby, he is very clear on how he doesn\u2019t want our baby to be spoiled and become dependent on us. I was upset at this because I want to give my baby the world, simply because we have the money. We live in the suburbs where everyone and their mama is spoiled rotten and I do not want to make my baby an outcast. We spent about 2k on my baby\u2019s bedroom alone and due to COVID and due to my fear of getting sick we did not hold any special events for my baby which saved us a fortune but I did end up spending about 1k on my baby\u2019s clothes, toys, bottles, formula and diapers. My husband was very upset when he learned I spent nearly 3k on my baby. I explained to him that being a new mother is expensive and we have the money to burn. He then told me that I shouldn\u2019t spoil my baby anymore and that \u201cIt\u2019s not even alive yet.\u201d I got very emotional just thinking about losing my baby, my husband comforted me and apologized for what he said and explain that he just wants our baby to have \u201cThe upbringing we did\u201d which wasn\u2019t even an \u201cupbringing\u201d for him, he grew up upper middle class and I grew up just above poverty.

I asked if she thought she should call her doctor (not necessarily because I thought she was pregnant but just out of concern for her health in general). She said no &amp; figured it was allergies or her period was supposed to start.\n\nHer period is very regular, I mean I can damn near track it. She's said that she's always been this way &amp; has rarely been more than a day or 2 off. So when she was supposed to start earlier this month &amp; didn't she seemed a bit concerned. When she was a week late I pointed out that she hadn't been feeling herself &amp; maybe she should take a pregnancy test. She said there was no way she was pregnant &amp; she was probably just re-regulating or something like that. I said taking a test wouldn't hurt just to be sure but she wasn't having it so I dropped it.\n\nShe has a lot of fears &amp; phobias, one of them being emetophobia which is the fear of vomit. It's something she's struggled with since she was a kid. Usually even someone around her saying they feel sick will send her into full blown panic mode.\n\nThursday night she was supposed to visit her grandmother so when I came home after work I was surprised to see her laying on the couch. I said you're home early &amp; she told me she didn't go. When I asked why she told me that while she was driving home she felt nauseous &amp; decided to not go.\n\nI asked if she was okay &amp; questioned the nausea. She told me it was nothing, probably something she ate. Being nauseous for any reason would normally cause her to freak out &amp; now she's being so nonchalant about it.She again blew it off like it was nothing.\n\nI again mentioned taking a pregnancy test, she has all these symptoms, why not just take a test &amp; find out. If she is, she is, if she's not, she's not, &amp; then we can put our minds at ease. We went back &amp; forth a little bit basically her argument is that she's not pregnant, there's no way she's pregnant, &amp; she wishes that I would just drop it.

This is probably the worst argument we've ever had &amp; I don't know what to do. Do I apologize?\n\nI didn't think I was doing anything wrong but maybe I should've just kept my mouth shut. I'm not trying to push her, I'm just worried. If she is pregnant then she has to get the proper care. If she's not then there's something else going on health wise that she should get checked.\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend has common pregnancy symptoms, I kept mentioning taking a test, &amp; she kept refusing.

I think she's pregnant. I keep encouraging her to take a test &amp; she refuses.\n\nFor the past month or so she's been saying that she doesn't feel good. She's been extremely tired/fatigued, complaining of back pain and headaches, feeling bloated, &amp; overall just not feeling well. I asked if she thought she should call her doctor (not necessarily because I thought she was pregnant but just out of concern for her health in general). She said no &amp; figured it was allergies or her period was supposed to start.\n\nHer period is very regular, I mean I can damn near track it. She's said that she's always been this way &amp; has rarely been more than a day or 2 off. So when she was supposed to start earlier this month &amp; didn't she seemed a bit concerned. When she was a week late I pointed out that she hadn't been feeling herself &amp; maybe she should take a pregnancy test. She said there was no way she was pregnant &amp; she was probably just re-regulating or something like that. I said taking a test wouldn't hurt just to be sure but she wasn't having it so I dropped it.\n\nShe has a lot of fears &amp; phobias, one of them being emetophobia which is the fear of vomit. It's something she's struggled with since she was a kid. Usually even someone around her saying they feel sick will send her into full blown panic mode.\n\nThursday night she was supposed to visit her grandmother so when I came home after work I was surprised to see her laying on the couch. I said you're home early &amp; she told me she didn't go. When I asked why she told me that while she was driving home she felt nauseous &amp; decided to not go.\n\nI asked if she was okay &amp; questioned the nausea. She told me it was nothing, probably something she ate. Being nauseous for any reason would normally cause her to freak out &amp; now she's being so nonchalant about it.She again blew it off like it was nothing.\n\nI again mentioned taking a pregnancy test, she has all these symptoms, why not just take a test &amp; find out. If she is, she is, if she's not, she's not, &amp; then we can put our minds at ease. We went back &amp; forth a little bit basically her argument is that she's not pregnant, there's no way she's pregnant, &amp; she wishes that I would just drop it. She stormed off to bed, I slept in the guest room, &amp; that was that.\n\nShe has been giving me the cold shoulder since Thursday night. We're usually great about communication. This is probably the worst argument we've ever had &amp; I don't know what to do. Do I apologize?\n\nI didn't think I was doing anything wrong but maybe I should've just kept my mouth shut. I'm not trying to push her, I'm just worried. If she is pregnant then she has to get the proper care. If she's not then there's something else going on health wise that she should get checked.\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend has common pregnancy symptoms, I kept mentioning taking a test, &amp; she kept refusing. We argued about it and now she's giving me the cold shoulder. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So my husband and I have separate chores that we've taken on in our relationship and part of mine has always been cleaning the bathrooms. He's never picked up a toilet brush in his life, and I'm usually perfectly fine with doing my part. I cleaned it before we left for dinner tonight and all was well. After dinner, something didn't agree with him and he spent a good 30 minutes in the bathroom (although I could hear him in there playing on his phone for a while). Later, when I went to use it myself, I found that it was destroyed in a way I'm struggling to describe. Dried crap was splattered all over the bowel, all over the bottom of the seat, it was BAD, like I actually gagged. And I had just cleaned it before we left, so I was especially pissed that he'd made no effort to correct the situation.\n\nWhen I told him I was grossed out, he pretended that he didn't know he'd left it that way, which didn't make sense because he has eyes. I said that he needs to clean it, no way am I doing it, especially since I'd just done it hours before. He said so what I'd just done it, that bathroom is my job. He then said that he'd just bought me dinner, and me refusing to clean up his mess made me ungrateful (although he's just come back from a 3 week vacation and I took care of our two kids by myself and the dinner was supposed to be a thank you for that). Things escalated and ended by him shouting \"if you don't clean it that will show me who you really are\" and I don't even know what that means. All I know is I feel like if the situation were reversed, I wouldn't have left such a mess for him and told him it's his problem to deal with.\n\nSo AITA for not doing a chore I would normally do because of this specific situation?

So my husband and I have separate chores that we've taken on in our relationship and part of mine has always been cleaning the bathrooms. He's never picked up a toilet brush in his life, and I'm usually perfectly fine with doing my part. I cleaned it before we left for dinner tonight and all was well. After dinner, something didn't agree with him and he spent a good 30 minutes in the bathroom (although I could hear him in there playing on his phone for a while). Later, when I went to use it myself, I found that it was destroyed in a way I'm struggling to describe. Dried crap was splattered all over the bowel, all over the bottom of the seat, it was BAD, like I actually gagged. And I had just cleaned it before we left, so I was especially pissed that he'd made no effort to correct the situation.\n\nWhen I told him I was grossed out, he pretended that he didn't know he'd left it that way, which didn't make sense because he has eyes. I said that he needs to clean it, no way am I doing it, especially since I'd just done it hours before. He said so what I'd just done it, that bathroom is my job. He then said that he'd just bought me dinner, and me refusing to clean up his mess made me ungrateful (although he's just come back from a 3 week vacation and I took care of our two kids by myself and the dinner was supposed to be a thank you for that). Things escalated and ended by him shouting \"if you don't clean it that will show me who you really are\" and I don't even know what that means. All I know is I feel like if the situation were reversed, I wouldn't have left such a mess for him and told him it's his problem to deal with.\n\nSo AITA for not doing a chore I would normally do because of this specific situation? I acknowledge the this is normally my job, but I feel like this is NOT a normal situation!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In his mind, men are meant to provide and protect, and women are to nurture children.  He\u2019s been unemployed for months now and was recently evicted from his apartment. \n\nDiane has a very close relationship with my nephew, \u201cIsaac.\u201d Isaac is a sweet kid, who according to his father is \u201ctoo girly.\u201d He\u2019s expressed to us that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around Moses because of his traditional views and past behaviour. Diane and I both try to support him as much as possible. When we learned about Moses\u2019 situation, we invited the both of them to stay with us until Moses had a steady source of income. \n\nOverall, Moses has been a decent houseguest. He\u2019s been respectful, cleaned up after himself and has not made a big fuss. The living arrangements were working.\n\nOne evening, Diane was helping Isaac with his math homework and Moses started making \u201csubtle\u201d comments about how she should wait for me to teach him the \u201cproper way,\u201d or how she should wait for the \u201csmart, real mathematician\u201d to come home. Diane tries to tell him to stop, but he doesn\u2019t listen.\n\nWithin the minute of me walking through my door, Moses asks me to help Isaac with his math homework. I agreed, because I was under the impression that Isaac needed/wanted my help. In the dining room, I can clearly see Diane and Isaac working through math problems - not needing my help, so I decide to leave them alone and go start preparing dinner. \n\nI guess Moses was annoyed that Diane was still helping him, because he starts to complain about how \u201cDiane is doing the homework wrong,\u201d and is \u201ccausing Isaac to fail his homework,\u201d and \u201cthat I need to double-check the homework because she doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s doing.\u201d To be fair, I found his reasoning to be quite funny, so I laughed and kept repeating that I wouldn\u2019t help Isaac.  Diane is very good at math, and though she isn\u2019t a \u201creal mathematician,\u201d by Moses\u2019 standard, I can guarantee you that she can handle some highschool level math problems. \n\nMy laughter and refusal to help only angered Moses. \n\nHe\u2019s become very disrespectful towards Diane. He\u2019s started to make comments about how, \u201cthere\u2019s now way a pretty girl like you can understand complex problems,\u201d or how she should be working on finishing her \u201ceasy doctorate,\u201d before trying to understand mine. I\u2019ve called him out every single time he\u2019s made those comments, but I feel a bit guilty. I don\u2019t care what he says about me, but I do care about what he says to Diane. I don\u2019t want him to be a pain in the ass because I handled a situation wrong or felt I had to prove a point.  Diane says that my laughter could be seen as a dismissal for his feelings, which would only anger him more. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be the reason Diane (and Isaac) are being harassed/made uncomfortable.\n\nEDIT: Of course I\u2019m not just standing there and letting Moses insult Diane.

In his mind, men are meant to provide and protect, and women are to nurture children.  He\u2019s been unemployed for months now and was recently evicted from his apartment. \n\nDiane has a very close relationship with my nephew, \u201cIsaac.\u201d Isaac is a sweet kid, who according to his father is \u201ctoo girly.\u201d He\u2019s expressed to us that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around Moses because of his traditional views and past behaviour. Diane and I both try to support him as much as possible. When we learned about Moses\u2019 situation, we invited the both of them to stay with us until Moses had a steady source of income. \n\nOverall, Moses has been a decent houseguest. He\u2019s been respectful, cleaned up after himself and has not made a big fuss. The living arrangements were working.\n\nOne evening, Diane was helping Isaac with his math homework and Moses started making \u201csubtle\u201d comments about how she should wait for me to teach him the \u201cproper way,\u201d or how she should wait for the \u201csmart, real mathematician\u201d to come home. Diane tries to tell him to stop, but he doesn\u2019t listen.\n\nWithin the minute of me walking through my door, Moses asks me to help Isaac with his math homework. I agreed, because I was under the impression that Isaac needed/wanted my help. In the dining room, I can clearly see Diane and Isaac working through math problems - not needing my help, so I decide to leave them alone and go start preparing dinner. \n\nI guess Moses was annoyed that Diane was still helping him, because he starts to complain about how \u201cDiane is doing the homework wrong,\u201d and is \u201ccausing Isaac to fail his homework,\u201d and \u201cthat I need to double-check the homework because she doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s doing.\u201d To be fair, I found his reasoning to be quite funny, so I laughed and kept repeating that I wouldn\u2019t help Isaac.  Diane is very good at math, and though she isn\u2019t a \u201creal mathematician,\u201d by Moses\u2019 standard, I can guarantee you that she can handle some highschool level math problems. \n\nMy laughter and refusal to help only angered Moses. \n\nHe\u2019s become very disrespectful towards Diane. He\u2019s started to make comments about how, \u201cthere\u2019s now way a pretty girl like you can understand complex problems,\u201d or how she should be working on finishing her \u201ceasy doctorate,\u201d before trying to understand mine. I\u2019ve called him out every single time he\u2019s made those comments, but I feel a bit guilty. I don\u2019t care what he says about me, but I do care about what he says to Diane. I don\u2019t want him to be a pain in the ass because I handled a situation wrong or felt I had to prove a point.  Diane says that my laughter could be seen as a dismissal for his feelings, which would only anger him more. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be the reason Diane (and Isaac) are being harassed/made uncomfortable.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I recently moved to a city about 7 hours away from my hometown to start a new job and not long after that my sister came to visit. She brought her cat, which she had adopted about six weeks prior. She asked me if they could stay for a couple days as her friend would be picking her up to do a cross country road trip. I told her she was welcome to but was reluctant to let the cat stay as I\u2019m allergic to cat hair and just don\u2019t really like cats in general. She told me it would only be a few days and I relented.\n\nFast forward a couple days, my sister left early in the morning and when I woke up I realized she had left me with her cat. When I called her she said there wasn\u2019t room for the cat in the van and asked me to look after it for a month while she was gone. I told her there was no way I would survive a month with this cat as my allergies were already pretty bad over the last couple days. She pleaded with me to just watch the cat for a few more days and she would get a friend to come pick it up. I said fine but after a few days no one showed. My sister was no longer answering my texts or calls and after a week I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Since I had just moved here I don\u2019t really know anyone who would be willing to just take this cat off my hands so I gave the cat away to the local animal shelter. I did consider a pet hotel or paying someone to watch it but when I looked it up the rates were far too expensive and I know my sister wouldn't have the money to pay me back.\n\nMy sister got back from her trip yesterday and when I told her what happened she ran straight to the animal shelter but it wasn\u2019t there anymore. She bawled her eyes out and now is refusing to speak to me. I didn\u2019t think she would be this upset as she only had this cat for a few weeks but she\u2019s really upset and I feel pretty bad now.

I recently moved to a city about 7 hours away from my hometown to start a new job and not long after that my sister came to visit. She brought her cat, which she had adopted about six weeks prior. She asked me if they could stay for a couple days as her friend would be picking her up to do a cross country road trip. I told her she was welcome to but was reluctant to let the cat stay as I\u2019m allergic to cat hair and just don\u2019t really like cats in general. She told me it would only be a few days and I relented.\n\nFast forward a couple days, my sister left early in the morning and when I woke up I realized she had left me with her cat. When I called her she said there wasn\u2019t room for the cat in the van and asked me to look after it for a month while she was gone. I told her there was no way I would survive a month with this cat as my allergies were already pretty bad over the last couple days. She pleaded with me to just watch the cat for a few more days and she would get a friend to come pick it up. I said fine but after a few days no one showed. My sister was no longer answering my texts or calls and after a week I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Since I had just moved here I don\u2019t really know anyone who would be willing to just take this cat off my hands so I gave the cat away to the local animal shelter. I did consider a pet hotel or paying someone to watch it but when I looked it up the rates were far too expensive and I know my sister wouldn't have the money to pay me back.\n\nMy sister got back from her trip yesterday and when I told her what happened she ran straight to the animal shelter but it wasn\u2019t there anymore. She bawled her eyes out and now is refusing to speak to me. I didn\u2019t think she would be this upset as she only had this cat for a few weeks but she\u2019s really upset and I feel pretty bad now.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, your sister was totally TA for leaving her pet and putting you in a situation where your health was suffering. But it sounds like you belittled the attachment between your sister and her pet to make yourself feel better about giving the cat away in the end, but having only had a pet a few weeks doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love them as part of your life. I\u2019ve never had a pet I wasn\u2019t completely attached too pretty much immediately and most animal lovers will tell you the same, so to me the fact she\u2019d only had the cat briefly is a poor excuse and one that I think you are using to make yourself feel better about how much it upset her. I think you were wrong to convince yourself that she wouldn\u2019t be upset, and even more wrong to simply give away her cat without telling her that\u2019s what you would have to do if she didn\u2019t take responsibility. Hindsight is a wonderful thing of course, but I think it would have been better not to relent the second time, and to tell her at that point the cat would have to go to a shelter if she didn\u2019t arrange to pick it up. When you didn\u2019t do this, you took a risk she would flake out a second time, which she did and put her even more in the wrong. At that point, you could still maybe have found a boarder that just takes a deposit up front, and told your sister when she returned that she would need to settle the fees and reimburse you to get the cat back. You could even have talked to the shelter you left the cat with more about your situation to see if they could do anything to help. They might have been prepared to look after the cat for a short while to avoid needing to rehome it. Then there are animal welfare charities that could have done something similar. Ultimately though, keeping the cat and risking your health was never an option, and I don\u2019t think you realised how awful it would be for your sister to lose her cat.

This is my first time doing a Reddit post so please bear with me. Let me just do a quick background thing and we\u2019ll get into the actual story. \n\nOP: 17DG(demigirl) I\u2019m student body Vice President, AP student, and have always put grades in front of everything else because of my mother.\n\nMother: 37F, had me at 17, got into drugs and lost custody of me when I was 8 so I went to my grandparents till I was 16, and I\u2019ve been living with her for a year. She also NEVER sent me a card, visited me, etc. (also I was forced to take care of myself and her when I turned six. I had to drag her ass back into our apartment because she was drunk, I had to make dinners for both of us, I had to walk to school.)\n\nWe were at a family reunion yesterday and my mother was bragging to our relatives about how smart I was and that I got my brains from her so I interjected. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been in my life for years. All my smarts came from me.\u201d And I walked away before she could respond. Once we got into the car she started screaming at me about how I embarrassed her. I told her \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t lie if you don\u2019t want to be embarrassed.\u201d Then she went on a rant about how she was a good mother. I said \u201cif I could, I\u2019d go back to my grandparents.\u201d And then she went silent and drove us to Wendy\u2019s. She got me my favorite meal from when I was little and apologized. I feel so conflicted because it\u2019s been years maybe she has changed but I don\u2019t know. I feel like an asshole but my cousins keep telling me \u201cshe didn\u2019t fight to get custody back till you were almost a legal adult.\u201d \n\nSo AITA for embarrassing my mother at a family reunion.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your mom might not want to talk about it much with you because it might be really hard and embarrassing for her. But if you both want to start earning each other's respect and rebond, then you NEED to have the talk...multiple, in fact. Talk about why she never sent you cards. Why she never visited.

My parents split when I was young...maybe 3rd grade? It was hard on my mom. But I never knew the kind of sh\\*t she was dealing with at the time until she told me when I was about 19 or so. She always put up a strong front, even when I knew she was suffering... Apparently there was a time she almost committed suicide and I never knew until she told me. \n\n  \nSo...I can only imagine what your mom had to go through and continues to go through.

And being a single parent as a teen...man I don't even want to think about how hard that is.\n\nNow, Im not defending your mom and how she was messed up at your young age.

But holy shit. \n\nOur building is all mostly retirees and college kids but our neighbors next door that sound like Jerry Springer 24/7. They moved in about 10 months ago and I have no idea how many people live there. Because the apartments are studios or 1br, our lease says 3 people max. \n\nSo far I think there are 4 women in their late teens, early 20s, all of them are pregnant and have at least one kid, an elderly woman in a wheelchair on oxygen, two men who I think are baby daddies. One of them is a huge creep. He took my bikini bottoms off our patio railing and smiled at me while he sniffed them. I hate being home when my husband isn\u2019t. There\u2019s also a teen boy who sleeps on the patio and comes and goes. There\u2019s a pet limit to one dog per unit they have 5. There\u2019s dogshit everywhere, mostly on our patio where it connects to ours. I\u2019ve reported them to the property manager who says she can\u2019t do anything because of the pandemic but she was sending all the complaints about them to a woman at the corporate office. \n\nYesterday was just the kids all screaming and crying and weed smoke and dogs barking all night and day and setting off fire crackers. Some straight up juggalo bullshit. We didn\u2019t sleep at all. We\u2019d move but everything in our price range had a waiting list when we checked last month.\n\nThe property manager from the corporate office called this morning to tell us they raised our rent starting next month from 900$ to $1350. I snapped when she told me the price change and blurted out everything  especially since we can\u2019t use our patio or sleep or have any kind of peace, we\u2019re not paying the rent increase. She didn\u2019t know about the complaints so I told her all of it: from the potentially 12 people living there to the homeless teen boy, the poor old woman who I only see from the window some time and all the dogs. Turns out none of the complaints got forwarded to her. She said she\u2019d handle it. \n\nNow a LOT of cops are here, an ambulance, and I think CPS. It\u2019s bananas. I feel awful because it looks like some of them are getting arrested, even two of the women. My other neighbors said the older woman got loaded into the ambulance. \n\nA few of my friends in the other buildings say everyone is struggling right now and I shouldn\u2019t have complained and that I\u2019m being a Karen \u201cgetting people arrested just because\u201d.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "Swampgoblin85", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 121, "comment_karma": 0, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 502.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p91t4e/aita_for_getting_my_neighbors_evicted/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 79, "NTA": 54, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 25}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because he is doing an apprenticeship and I'm in college we both don't have much money and are each living with our parents. We have to visit each other on the weekends and stay at our PILs houses.\nHis mother and I don't really get along and I'm not allowed to stay longer than the weekend. \n\nNow the situation :\nMy best friend (20F) who lives in my BFs city called me on a Sunday crying and telling me that a horrible family emergency happend. I asked my BF if I could stay for two weeks at his place because two weeks later was her birthday. He asked his parents and they said it's fine. After her birthday my best friend called me and asked me to stay longer and that I could sleep at her place. I agreed and stayed 3 days at her place, where I got bronchitis. Thursday night my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to come back to his place and I asked if it's okay for his parents. He said he didn't asked them but it will probably be alright so he picked me up and I spend the night there.\n\nWhen I woke up he said his mother wants me gone immediately. I said I can't leave now because my best friend is gone until the next day so I can't stay at her place and I can't drive home because of a rail strike (I don't have a car) . Also I was sick at the moment (literally coughing blood) and had my period. He said his mother didn't care so I left.Outside I started crying and called my sister (16F). She told my mother who said she will pick me up and drove 1,5 hours to get me. \n\nWhen I went to the car, my bf and his mom came out of the house too (MIL allowed me to wait for my mother at their place) and greeted my mother. My mother was angry but kept cool and even shook my MILs hand, but without saying a word. My mother gave me painkillers and food and we drove away. 10 minutes after that I got a message from my bf that he is furious because his mother started crying after we drove away because my mother was so cold to her. He said that I am a terrible human being because I allegedly talked shit about his mother so that my mother would be angry and said I was disrespectful because I was allowed to stay two weeks and I wouldn't respect his parents decisions about not staying longer than weekends. Also the fact that my mother brought me food made it seem like I wouldn't get food there which is also disrespectful according to his mother.

My MIL doesn't want to talk to me and thinks I'm an asshole because she allegedly was always nice to me. \n\nReasons why I don't think I'm the asshole:\nMy boyfriend picked me up and wanted me to stay at his place without his parents permission (his only defence to that was that \"he didn't expect that it would end like this\"), so it was partly his fault that I stayed there.

Because he is doing an apprenticeship and I'm in college we both don't have much money and are each living with our parents. We have to visit each other on the weekends and stay at our PILs houses.\nHis mother and I don't really get along and I'm not allowed to stay longer than the weekend. \n\nNow the situation :\nMy best friend (20F) who lives in my BFs city called me on a Sunday crying and telling me that a horrible family emergency happend. I asked my BF if I could stay for two weeks at his place because two weeks later was her birthday. He asked his parents and they said it's fine. After her birthday my best friend called me and asked me to stay longer and that I could sleep at her place. I agreed and stayed 3 days at her place, where I got bronchitis. Thursday night my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to come back to his place and I asked if it's okay for his parents. He said he didn't asked them but it will probably be alright so he picked me up and I spend the night there.\n\nWhen I woke up he said his mother wants me gone immediately. I said I can't leave now because my best friend is gone until the next day so I can't stay at her place and I can't drive home because of a rail strike (I don't have a car) . Also I was sick at the moment (literally coughing blood) and had my period. He said his mother didn't care so I left.Outside I started crying and called my sister (16F). She told my mother who said she will pick me up and drove 1,5 hours to get me. \n\nWhen I went to the car, my bf and his mom came out of the house too (MIL allowed me to wait for my mother at their place) and greeted my mother. My mother was angry but kept cool and even shook my MILs hand, but without saying a word. My mother gave me painkillers and food and we drove away. 10 minutes after that I got a message from my bf that he is furious because his mother started crying after we drove away because my mother was so cold to her. He said that I am a terrible human being because I allegedly talked shit about his mother so that my mother would be angry and said I was disrespectful because I was allowed to stay two weeks and I wouldn't respect his parents decisions about not staying longer than weekends. Also the fact that my mother brought me food made it seem like I wouldn't get food there which is also disrespectful according to his mother. My boyfriends whole family is mad that we made my MIL cry and he demanded that I apologize to his mother, while I think she should. \n\nSo AITA because I didn't apologize to my MIL?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You said he got addicted to coke after you left? Coke is a really weird thing to get hooked on unless you\u2019re in a party scene. More than likely what happened is he partied hard after the breakup and got hooked on coke and his friends blame you. That\u2019s not your fault and it\u2019s not even a good guilting reason. No one feels bad for anyone who gets hooked on a drug that costs $90 a gram minimum (in case you aren\u2019t aware, marijuana is sold $10-$15 a gram on average). It\u2019s hell for your wallet but don\u2019t let them make it out like he was suffering. And even if he was, you don\u2019t get back with someone to push away their personal problems. You\u2019re not a solution or an anti drug. You\u2019re a person. \n\nPart 2, after 7 years of being with this guy through childhood, that\u2019s not how a future MIL acts. Not at all. I\u2019m my boyfriends first serious relationship and he\u2019s also the youngest, when we were trying to move back to the same state as our families (I\u2019m 21 as well btw) she offered to let me stay as long as I needed to find a job or anything I needed because she knew I wasn\u2019t super comfortable staying with my family at the time. She treats me like family and I\u2019ve been with him for far less time than you. I didn\u2019t grow up with him like you did. \n\nPart 3, even if that was one of the problems the main thing is how your boyfriend treated you. That\u2019s just actually disgusting. No one who loves anyone would kick them out and leave them on a curb to figure it out when you\u2019re spewing blood. I wouldn\u2019t even do that to a stranger because it\u2019s just so messed up. Of course your mom was upset, she expects your boyfriend to take care of you and protect you and instead he leaves you coughing up blood on the curb. And then he GETS MAD AT YOU FOR YOUR MOMS REACTION! Not even yours! A whole separate person you can\u2019t control! But if the tables were turned and it was YOUR mom upset, his mom wouldn\u2019t have had the politeness to stay silent and he still would\u2019ve been mad at you. \n\nHe\u2019s awful and you\u2019re young. 7 years through childhood is a lot. Break it off and be single for at least a year. Figure out what you want in a guy by listing out what you didn\u2019t like in this one. Dating is a trial and error, I never tried to take it seriously until I found someone who made me take it seriously, and I encourage you to have the same mindset.

I had to go home cause I had work the next morning at 11.\n\nWhen I got home he told me we should hang out from six or seven until I had to go to work and I told him I would probably be asleep, but would still consider it. \n\nWell, I did fall asleep, and around 6:30 someone started lightly knocking on my bedroom window. It barely woke me up so I ignored it but then they started banging it so I raised the blinds and it was my boyfriend. He told me he tried to call but I didn't answer so he came to wake me up this way. \n\nI told him to go home because I was barely awake and he told me I shouldn't be so tired cause I had slept when I got home and he stayed awake at his house. I told him that that wasn't my fault and that he shouldn't have come when I didn't tell him to. Not to mention waking me up and potentially waking my parents.\n\nHe started complaining that he drove thirty minutes to see me and how all he wanted was ten minutes to talk and hug and kiss and stuff. I told him no and shut the window but he kept banging on it so I told him he was a psycho and that I would call the police if he didn't go home. He claimed I was just trying to push him away, but he did leave and we made up on FaceTime. \n\nBut today he told me he was still upset that he drove thirty minutes to see me and I couldn't spare him ten minutes, but I never told him to do that and it should've been obvious that I was asleep. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So let me explain. I (21M) got an apartment and my old roommate (27M) graduated early and moved back to Georgia to be with his wife. That wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was he wasn\u2019t paying his half of the rent. So I needed someone who was going to pay the rent. I have spoken about this with him and he was okay with it as long as I found someone. So here\u2019s where I am now, my ad for my apartment went out but I have only been attracting females for it even though I posted on my ad, prefer a male roommate. I called my college housing and they are completely booked. So this girl (we\u2019ll call her Harley), Harley messages me and says she\u2019s interested. Her and I used to do a sport together so I was comfortable with her moving in. However my girlfriend (22F) is a little uncomfortable with the fact of her moving in even though this is my last option (other than just staying there by myself). Now my girlfriend actually wanted to move in with me and pay half of the rent when we first started having problems with my old roommate. At the time I believed that only two people could be on the lease since it\u2019s a two bedroom apartment. In addition I didn\u2019t want to put her parents in the spot I was in which is paying for a place that she wouldn\u2019t have even been in because she would have to go back to culinary school in a few months. Plus I thought it would be way to much hassle to be constantly changing leases and people. This was about a year ago. However, this past week, she went with me to the leasing office meeting where we both heard that three people could be on the lease. She was not happy about this and with us both now going back on campus, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay. Now Harley has confirmed with me she really likes the apartment and wants to move in. I\u2019m okay with it, my parents are okay with it, my girlfriend says she\u2019s okay with it but I can tell she\u2019s still very uncomfortable about this. I will say my girlfriend does suffer from PTSD and has had men cheat on her before the relationship with me. She says she trusts me but I can tell she\u2019s more anxious now that it\u2019s getting closer to the time Harley is supposed to move in. She\u2019s also been dealing with a lot of stuff in her life that has triggered her anxiety and PTSD. So I\u2019m very confused as my girlfriend has said that even if she wasn\u2019t there, she\u2019d still pay half as we could use that apartment later if I decided to stay here for med school. But I don\u2019t want to live in this apartment by myself for the school year, so AITA? \n\nTLDR: current roommate doesn\u2019t pay half rent. Need new roommate. Only option is a girl. GF is upset.

So let me explain. I (21M) got an apartment and my old roommate (27M) graduated early and moved back to Georgia to be with his wife. That wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was he wasn\u2019t paying his half of the rent. So I needed someone who was going to pay the rent. I have spoken about this with him and he was okay with it as long as I found someone. So here\u2019s where I am now, my ad for my apartment went out but I have only been attracting females for it even though I posted on my ad, prefer a male roommate. I called my college housing and they are completely booked. So this girl (we\u2019ll call her Harley), Harley messages me and says she\u2019s interested. Her and I used to do a sport together so I was comfortable with her moving in. However my girlfriend (22F) is a little uncomfortable with the fact of her moving in even though this is my last option (other than just staying there by myself). Now my girlfriend actually wanted to move in with me and pay half of the rent when we first started having problems with my old roommate. At the time I believed that only two people could be on the lease since it\u2019s a two bedroom apartment. In addition I didn\u2019t want to put her parents in the spot I was in which is paying for a place that she wouldn\u2019t have even been in because she would have to go back to culinary school in a few months. Plus I thought it would be way to much hassle to be constantly changing leases and people. This was about a year ago. However, this past week, she went with me to the leasing office meeting where we both heard that three people could be on the lease. She was not happy about this and with us both now going back on campus, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay. Now Harley has confirmed with me she really likes the apartment and wants to move in. I\u2019m okay with it, my parents are okay with it, my girlfriend says she\u2019s okay with it but I can tell she\u2019s still very uncomfortable about this. I will say my girlfriend does suffer from PTSD and has had men cheat on her before the relationship with me. She says she trusts me but I can tell she\u2019s more anxious now that it\u2019s getting closer to the time Harley is supposed to move in.

She tries to get the other hostess to start doing it for a while. So this past week I guess some there was some news on OF saying they were gonna shut down the sexually explicit stuff so she was more vocal about onlyfans stuff at work than usual. I overheard that she goes by her first name on onlyfans which is pretty unique.\n\nOut of curiosity I did a search for her name and was able to find it and I subbed. I don't know how she found out, like if they can see subscribers names or something but the today she asked me if I subbed to her OF and I was like yeah. She told me that's not cool and I am invading her privacy. I'm like okay I can cancel my sub. Then she tells me to delete any pics and videos I saved. And I was like no I paid for those. So she says she'll give me my money back and I'm like okay then. But now she wants to come to my house to make sure I delete the stuff. And I'm like no just take my word for it. But she is insisting on coming to my place. She says I am an asshole for all this but I think she's an asshole for making such a big deal about this. It's not like I've ever made any creepy comments in person or commented on any of her OF stuff. I was like dude who TF cares if I know what your butthole looks like, hundreds of people know what it looks like.\n\nAITA?\n\ntldr: subbed to my co workers OF when she makes it no secret that she is a sexworker part time. she says it's creepy, I say she's overreacting\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And my wife quickly assumed splitting the kids 3 ways so 33.3% each. Which at face value I would agree with. However my step kids parents make a ridiculous amount of money. The ex-husband probably makes 1m+ a year running his own business and his wife was initially a client of his business who makes a similar amount? I'm not really sure.\n\nAnyways my concern is that I imagine if we split three ways that my step kids will also get a sizable inheritance from their father and/or his wife. At the end of the day our daughter will only get inheritance from us so she should get a larger share. I suggested 50% and her previous kids get 25% each. My wife responded with no way I love each of my kids equally and I'm not splitting up in that way.\n\nI told her that it doesn't mean that you love any of the kids more or less than the other. I was trying to break it down in a monetary way and that I didn't want our daughter to get the short end of the stick so to speak. She also said what her ex-husband makes isn't part of the conversation and we shouldn't take it into consideration.\n\nI think it's absolutely relevant. Assuming we do 33% for each kid and they get 1m each. And the step kids get 50% each from the ex-husband they'd get an extra 1m but realistically with their income it's most likely so, so, much more by the time any inheritance transpires.\n\nAnyways AITA?\n\nEdit: I have no relationship with my step-children. Beyond being invited to birthday parties as an extension of my wife. I do not love them any less because I know how much they mean to my wife which makes them just as important to me. \n\nWe're just in a situation where the step-sibling are taken care of and then some financially already and from an inevitable inheritance will receive a sizable fortune. I just want to be able to provide a similar boon for our daughter.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "Annual-Training-1601", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 423, "comment_karma": 363, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 294.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p8zlik/aita_for_wanting_to_give_our_daughter_a_larger/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 51, "NTA": 13, "YTA": 5, "Neutral": 33}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We have tried talking to him multiple times, with a verbal altercation breaking out the other day, in which he stormed off and left the house barely five minutes in.\n\nI asked him for one good reason why he can't share the bathroom in the master bedroom with my mother, stating it's for \"privacy\" despite them being together for 17 years, and my mother saying she has no problem with however early he may be awake, or if he is playing music. He went on to say \"I've lived here for 17 years, and I want to use that bathroom!\" going on to tell me to get my own place (which we are unable to as both me and my girlfriend are trying to balance work, school, and internships), despite me also living in the house longer than him and his children which have since moved out who we also shared the bathroom with. He was acting as if I don't live there anymore due to me sometimes spending time at my girlfriend's family home a few days out of the week so she can see her extended family when they are in town. Her home is only twenty minutes from my own. \n\nThe upstairs bathroom has one sink, and and average size tub with a newer shower head and his portable speaker, along with other toiletries of his. Their bathroom has a jack and jill sink, with a much nicer shower head and bigger tub as well. He complains about the sink getting dirty in our bathroom from toothpaste which me and my girlfriend clean, and hairs on the floor which aren't just my own and I also clean. He knows that my girlfriend does not like him at all but hasn't done anything to attempt and learn why or correct his behavior, instead doubling down on all of his actions like now. It's gotten to the point where I am unsure if I am still welcome in my home, as my mother wants no part of this either, saying she's done all she can. Others have said that since it's been the way it is for long, we're just disrupting everything and the conflict is my fault in the end. I feel as if maybe I'm not understanding something and just imposing what I feel is fair for me and my girlfriend sometimes, so AITA?", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "Fakeyfakersons", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 263, "comment_karma": 213, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 277.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p8wg74/aita_for_wanting_my_step_dad_to_use_the_bathroom/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 68, "NTA": 20, "YTA": 12, "Neutral": 36}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As soon as he wakes every morning up, he leaves his room and goes upstairs to the bathroom, with the amount of time spent in there typically anywhere from an hour and a half to over two hours. The bathroom is close enough to my room we can hear the water running whenever someone is in the shower, but not connected by a wall. We have tried talking to him multiple times, with a verbal altercation breaking out the other day, in which he stormed off and left the house barely five minutes in.\n\nI asked him for one good reason why he can't share the bathroom in the master bedroom with my mother, stating it's for \"privacy\" despite them being together for 17 years, and my mother saying she has no problem with however early he may be awake, or if he is playing music. He went on to say \"I've lived here for 17 years, and I want to use that bathroom!\" going on to tell me to get my own place (which we are unable to as both me and my girlfriend are trying to balance work, school, and internships), despite me also living in the house longer than him and his children which have since moved out who we also shared the bathroom with. He was acting as if I don't live there anymore due to me sometimes spending time at my girlfriend's family home a few days out of the week so she can see her extended family when they are in town. Her home is only twenty minutes from my own. \n\nThe upstairs bathroom has one sink, and and average size tub with a newer shower head and his portable speaker, along with other toiletries of his. Their bathroom has a jack and jill sink, with a much nicer shower head and bigger tub as well. He complains about the sink getting dirty in our bathroom from toothpaste which me and my girlfriend clean, and hairs on the floor which aren't just my own and I also clean. He knows that my girlfriend does not like him at all but hasn't done anything to attempt and learn why or correct his behavior, instead doubling down on all of his actions like now. It's gotten to the point where I am unsure if I am still welcome in my home, as my mother wants no part of this either, saying she's done all she can. Others have said that since it's been the way it is for long, we're just disrupting everything and the conflict is my fault in the end. I feel as if maybe I'm not understanding something and just imposing what I feel is fair for me and my girlfriend sometimes, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But what would we get? \n\n* Achievement Flairs:\n   * Top Karma \n   * Top Poster \n   * Top Awarded\n   * Powerups Supporters \n* Custom emojis\n   * Uploaded by the mods. But we would hold a \u2018contest\u2019 for users to create custom emojis for the sub \n* Animated Reddit emojis (\u201cSnoomojis\u201d) \n* A \u201cPowerups Community Heroes list\u201d (users that applied a powerup)\n* ~~GIF replies in comments~~ \n   * It\u2019s part of Reddit\u2019s Powerups options, but we wouldn\u2019t turn this on.

She has two older children (Luc and Larry) who are 19 and 21. \n\nI have a son from my previous relationship (DJ) who is 11. \n\nWe have no children together and have no plans. I has a vasectomy when DJ was born, because I didn't want any more children. \n\nGwen got upset because last week I told someone I only had a son. They asked how many kids I had and I said \"my son DJ, he turned 11.\" \n\nShe finally brought it up and said I should be saying, \"I have three kids, but one still lives at home.\" \n\nI told her that I understand she feels like DJ is one of her kids. He was still pretty young when we got married and we have him full time. But her sons were adults when we married, live with their Dad/on their own and have never thought of me as a dad. They don't even like me saying they are my step-sons. I have been introduced as \"Mom's husband Mike.\" \n\nShe said I was making her feel weird. \n\nI told her it was weird to try to force a parental roll on an adult man. And that I would likely never view her children as my children, because they have a father, don't want me to be \"dad\" and are grown. \n\nShe then said, what if I didn't see DJ as mine?  \n\n\nI told her I wouldn't be hurt if she never felt that way. DJ had a Mom, has never called her Mom, and really its up to the kids who they view in each row. She then asked if DJ saw her as a parent and I said, \"I don't know. If he has an issue with it, he can talk to me about it. He has never said he doesn't like you, but he doesn't call you Mom. Because he has a Mom.\" \n\nShe spent the night with her sister and I have been at home with DJ. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But if it doesn't and I get charged, you have to pay for it\" and she agreed. Fast forward, the red and purple dye stained the entire bathroom. Towels, curtains, etc. I got a charge today for $400 for incidental fees so I passed that charge over to her. She refused to pay it, saying: \"I don't have money or a job anymore\" so then I lost it. I went to my mother who has a small savings account for her college (she's going to hair school, if that matters) and my mom said she will pull it out of that. My stepdad chimed in and said he would pay for the entire fee. My sister, being the youngest and growing up as an only child (I grew up with my dad and stepmom) she got everything handed to her on a silver platter. I lost my shit once again. I told my stepdad that she needed to pay from it from her OWN money because she was the one that chose to dye our friends's hair and she needs to realize that she can't always have them paying for everything. I only agreed on the sole statement that she can get everything out and she agreed she would be responsible for any damages. He insisted, and I said that if they paid for it in any way and I found out, I would no longer visit them and cease all contact. They agreed and my sister lost $400 which nearly drained most her savings that my mom had for her. She is extremely pissed at me because it was school money and now she has to wait to start school. I do feel bad, but, she refused to pay me herself, so it needed to come from somewhere that was her money. AITA?\n\nEdit: I was an asshole for threatening my parents. I apologized a few days later to them because I know that wasn't okay. I know I said it at the heat of the moment of anger. I could never cut contact with them, I love them to death and I can't imagine my life without them. What I said was stupid and immature.\n\nEdit2: I'm going to try and make things right. I was a huge asshole. I'll see if my parents will return the $400 to her account. If by chance they won't, I'll take $400 from my savings account and put it back, count my losses, and move on.\n\nEdit3: she still will go to hair school, so to everyone that's implying she missed out on school completely, don't worry!

My sister wanted to dye their hair in the hotel room. I was very against it until she promised she can get all the dye out. I told her: \"alright, fine. But if it doesn't and I get charged, you have to pay for it\" and she agreed. Fast forward, the red and purple dye stained the entire bathroom. Towels, curtains, etc. I got a charge today for $400 for incidental fees so I passed that charge over to her. She refused to pay it, saying: \"I don't have money or a job anymore\" so then I lost it. I went to my mother who has a small savings account for her college (she's going to hair school, if that matters) and my mom said she will pull it out of that. My stepdad chimed in and said he would pay for the entire fee. My sister, being the youngest and growing up as an only child (I grew up with my dad and stepmom) she got everything handed to her on a silver platter. I lost my shit once again. I told my stepdad that she needed to pay from it from her OWN money because she was the one that chose to dye our friends's hair and she needs to realize that she can't always have them paying for everything. I only agreed on the sole statement that she can get everything out and she agreed she would be responsible for any damages. He insisted, and I said that if they paid for it in any way and I found out, I would no longer visit them and cease all contact. They agreed and my sister lost $400 which nearly drained most her savings that my mom had for her. She is extremely pissed at me because it was school money and now she has to wait to start school. I do feel bad, but, she refused to pay me herself, so it needed to come from somewhere that was her money. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She\u2019s Asian and went to a mostly white, Republican high school in the south. She is extremely woke and very active on social media. She posts constantly about politics and preaches about every woke issue all over her page.\n\nI\u2019m liberal, but I\u2019m not into wokeism at all and only skim over her page because I find it very annoying. Whenever she rants about race or being a woman in America and how she believes she\u2019s oppressed, I just internally roll my eyes and change the subject to keep the peace. She doesn\u2019t actually know any of my political opinions and I think she assumes our opinions are the same.\n\nLately, she constantly complains about how all her classmates from high school are \u201crevealing their hidden racism\u201d because, according to the app she uses to track followers, most of them have unfollowed her. She texted me in the middle of the night to rage about it.\n\nShe\u2019s talked before about how all her classmates were racist in high school, yet when I ask her what they did or said to make her think so, she can\u2019t actually name a single thing anyone has ever done. I woke up and saw her text, which was a rant about how all her classmates unfollowed her because they\u2019re racist, how women of color are oppressed and victimized, and how the reason she was never elected to leadership positions in high school is because of her classmates covert racism. She also said she was in beauty pageants her whole childhood, so the reason she never won prom queen is due to their her classmates\u2019 racism.\n\nI decided to finally speak my mind. I texted her that the reason her classmates unfollowed her is because she\u2019s insufferable and no one wants to see her political preaching all over their feed. I\u2019m a liberal and can\u2019t stand it, so why would her Republican classmates want to see her exhausting rants. I also said speak for yourself because I\u2019m a woman of color too, and I\u2019m sure as hell not oppressed or a victim. I went to a 90% white high school and I never had any trouble getting elected to tons of leadership positions or getting on the prom court. I told her she\u2019s just unlikeable and irritating to most people.\n\nShe responded that she never knew I have so much internalized hate and that I hate myself and am taking my rage out on her. I said no, I love myself and my physical appearance; she\u2019s just incredibly annoying.\n\nAITA for being rude to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's not that she's always careless but she has broken a crap ton of stuff before. It's both because she's very temperamental and so electronics can frustrate her and she stops taking care of things. She tore my PS2 controller clean off the cable when she was playing one of my Simpsons games with her friend and her friend won. Another time she was walking around with my laptop because our parents wouldn't buy her one and she dropped it. That was May 2020. She broke several phones (her own), she broke her friends gaming laptop.\n\nI moved out for college a couple of weeks ago and she wanted me to leave my new PS5 at home for her to play. I said hell no. She bugged me and bugged me and my parents said if I couldn't play it, which I can't, it shouldn't be too big of a deal to leave it for her to use so it's not \"gathering dust\" to quote them. My sister told me it's a dick move to take something I can't use when she could use it. I told her she won't get access to any of my valuable things anymore because I do not trust her and I am not spending money on nice things for her to use, I want to use them too and whenever she's using it I can almost guarantee it'll end up broken.\n\nShe told me I was so mean and it was cruel to make it seem like she can't be trusted with anything or like I'll never let her touch any of my stuff again.

She was my first girlfriend. We lived in the same dorm and had immediate chemistry with each other. She was shy with her feelings, so she would often communicate with me by passing small notes or sliding them under my door. I thought it was cute and started doing the same. It wasn't long before we were together and in our honeymoon phase. During this time, she would frequently write long letters to me; often waxing lyrical about our relationship and including poems. She would describe her past relationships, how I was different, how much I meant to her, and what our future might look like together. I very much appreciated them and we stayed together throughout college. I kept all these notes and letters in an envelope. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI moved away after I graduated. Months passed and it was clear that we were becoming frustrated at not being close together. We agreed that having a long-distance relationship was too difficult and we decided to break up. We were both still very much in love when it ended, but we knew that the distance would make us bitter. The choice was to preserve the memories we had of our time together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had relationships after her. These never amounted to much. Whenever they started to get too serious, I would compare my feelings to those I had with my first love and they never lived up to that standard. It would drive me mad. Years had passed and I figured I would never move on. After my third failed relationship, I decided I needed to remove every trace of my first love and forget about her completely if I ever wanted to be happy in love. As a symbol of this, I took the envelope of all her letters and notes and burned them in a fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 6 years ago, my first love reached out over social media. We discovered we were working in the same city and we went for dinner. We immediately fell back to where we left off. For once, a relationship felt right and a year later, we were married. Recently, my wife dusted off her college things and found all the notes and letters I had written her. We had a wonderful night laughing about them. She then asked me to go get hers. I admitted I burned them because I couldn't get over her. She reacted very badly to this. She is a very sentimental person and felt hurt that I tried to erase her, as if she never existed. She explained that she hoped to show her children those letters to show them what real love felt like. She detailed how long she spent trying to capture all her emotions in words. After that night, the atmosphere between us has been tense and she has completely emotionally withdrawn\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel awful that I destroyed something so important to us and our story, but at the same time, I never expected us to reunite.

We were both still very much in love when it ended, but we knew that the distance would make us bitter. The choice was to preserve the memories we had of our time together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had relationships after her. These never amounted to much. Whenever they started to get too serious, I would compare my feelings to those I had with my first love and they never lived up to that standard. It would drive me mad. Years had passed and I figured I would never move on. After my third failed relationship, I decided I needed to remove every trace of my first love and forget about her completely if I ever wanted to be happy in love. As a symbol of this, I took the envelope of all her letters and notes and burned them in a fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 6 years ago, my first love reached out over social media. We discovered we were working in the same city and we went for dinner. We immediately fell back to where we left off. For once, a relationship felt right and a year later, we were married. Recently, my wife dusted off her college things and found all the notes and letters I had written her. We had a wonderful night laughing about them. She then asked me to go get hers. I admitted I burned them because I couldn't get over her. She reacted very badly to this. She is a very sentimental person and felt hurt that I tried to erase her, as if she never existed. She explained that she hoped to show her children those letters to show them what real love felt like. She detailed how long she spent trying to capture all her emotions in words. After that night, the atmosphere between us has been tense and she has completely emotionally withdrawn\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel awful that I destroyed something so important to us and our story, but at the same time, I never expected us to reunite. I felt burning them would be the only way I'd ever get closure. AITA for burning my wife's love letters?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sil decided on an upscale restaurant that has sort of \"dress code\" for guests.\nWon't say the name of the restaurant however, *IT'S A WELL KNOWN RESTAURANT IN MEANISOTA!*\nSo, my long term girlfriend *Lauren went shopping and bought stuff that I didn't even look at but I kept reminding her of the dress code rule they had and she said she already found an outfit that goes well with the rule so no worries!\n\nI got ready early and went to the restaurant alone cause Lauren said she'd come later after work. I waited for 20min since Lauren usually takes time to get ready. I texted her to see if everything was ok then she finally arrived and soon as she walked in, suddenly all eyes were on her glittering, bright light dress. She actually showed up in a completely different outfit than the one she showed me which went well with the dress code. But cause she changes her mind about what she wears every 5 min, I wasn't too surprised.\nLauren approached everyone then sat next to me. I whispered \"wtf?, and said that the dress she wore was part of the dress code at all. she shushed me saying no one will notice. Well, everyone did. The head of the staff wanted to have a word with her about it then SIL got involved. I was like, yeah, there's no way this was gunna to end well especially after Lauren and SIL started loudly arguing back and forth.\n\nLauren was asked to leave after she refused to change her dress. She was angry she told me we had to leave. I said not \"we\" but \"she\" since she broke the rule and I didn't. She was shocked by my response and insisted but I said \"Sorry just want to enjoy my brother's engagement\".\nShe complained not having money for an uber and I gave her the key and said she could take my car if she wanted. She walked out eventually and the party continued on. Then I went home and she was waiting for me still angry as hell. She asked why TF I let her go home alone and stayed at the party after the staff &amp; SIL distespected her and kicked her out.\n\nI asked what did she expect after she broke the rule they had. She said she expected to find a way to get around it and my SIL should've sided with her since we're family and also I should've left with her when was asked to leave. She added the dress code was actually very stupid and toooootally not her style anyway. I said she knew she was taking a chance by deciding to ignore the rule and show up like that.\nBut she lashed out saying she tried on over 10 outfits before deciding on this one and there was no way  to change it and I knew that since it's hard to convince her to wear stuff she doesn't like and that I shouldn't let her leave on her own since we're a unit. We've been arguing ever since.\n\n\nETA the dress code consisted of 2 piece outfits for women. Lauren wore a short, bright dress that stood out from the rest of the guests.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "BetterCallSaul7_", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 135, "comment_karma": 46, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 377.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p9bb00/aita_for_not_leaving_my_brothers_engagement_party/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 113, "NTA": 80, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 33}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sil decided on an upscale restaurant that has sort of \"dress code\" for guests.\nWon't say the name of the restaurant however, *IT'S A WELL KNOWN RESTAURANT IN MEANISOTA!*\nSo, my long term girlfriend *Lauren went shopping and bought stuff that I didn't even look at but I kept reminding her of the dress code rule they had and she said she already found an outfit that goes well with the rule so no worries!\n\nI got ready early and went to the restaurant alone cause Lauren said she'd come later after work. I waited for 20min since Lauren usually takes time to get ready. I texted her to see if everything was ok then she finally arrived and soon as she walked in, suddenly all eyes were on her glittering, bright light dress. She actually showed up in a completely different outfit than the one she showed me which went well with the dress code. But cause she changes her mind about what she wears every 5 min, I wasn't too surprised.\nLauren approached everyone then sat next to me. I whispered \"wtf?, and said that the dress she wore was part of the dress code at all. she shushed me saying no one will notice. Well, everyone did. The head of the staff wanted to have a word with her about it then SIL got involved. I was like, yeah, there's no way this was gunna to end well especially after Lauren and SIL started loudly arguing back and forth.\n\nLauren was asked to leave after she refused to change her dress. She was angry she told me we had to leave. I said not \"we\" but \"she\" since she broke the rule and I didn't. She was shocked by my response and insisted but I said \"Sorry just want to enjoy my brother's engagement\".\nShe complained not having money for an uber and I gave her the key and said she could take my car if she wanted. She walked out eventually and the party continued on. Then I went home and she was waiting for me still angry as hell. She asked why TF I let her go home alone and stayed at the party after the staff &amp; SIL distespected her and kicked her out.\n\nI asked what did she expect after she broke the rule they had. She said she expected to find a way to get around it and my SIL should've sided with her since we're family and also I should've left with her when was asked to leave. She added the dress code was actually very stupid and toooootally not her style anyway. I said she knew she was taking a chance by deciding to ignore the rule and show up like that.\nBut she lashed out saying she tried on over 10 outfits before deciding on this one and there was no way  to change it and I knew that since it's hard to convince her to wear stuff she doesn't like and that I shouldn't let her leave on her own since we're a unite. We've been arguing ever since.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But eh, maybe he had an excuse they bought, maybe they knew but didn't want to make me uncomfortable. \n\nBut it was like this for everything - \"so R tells us you're vegetarian!\" \"Uh yeah, WE are\" \"Oh, you didn't tell us she doesn't let you eat meat!\" (He says he started over a year before moving out) \u2014 \"are you planning to move to London with R when you graduate?\" \"We're moving to Germany\"\n\nWhen we got home I asked him about it, he told me he was neglected as a kid.

Went to local hole in the wall sports bar for dinner with pre-teen daughter.  No host, 1 bartender, 2-3 wait staff.  Told to seat ourselves and I ask if there is outdoor seating available.  Bartender says I think so, go check and see.  Nope, full.  Come back inside and find a table.  Sit there for 15+ minutes and no one swings by with menus or for drink orders despite serving tables adjacent to us.  I get up and walk up to bar and ask for menus ... a little irritated, but not especially rude to anyone.  Drinks and menus dropped to us a few minutes later.  Sit for another 25 minutes with no one asking to take our order, again despite service to other tables around us, including one that was seated and placed order within 5 minutes of coming in.  I flag bartender down as he cashes out the table next to us and ask for our check for the two drinks because we would like to go eat dinner somewhere else since we've been here 45 minutes and it doesn't seem like they really want us to eat here.  He says sure, comes back a couple minutes later and offers dinner \"on the house\".  I explain to him that I am not looking for a free meal, I am happy to pay, have been to this place many times with no issues and I don't understand why the service is so poor.  I just want to be treated like everyone else that seems like a regular around here.  He apologizes a couple of times and I am admittedly still a little hot, explaining to him why I am upset and why it isn't right.  Lady at the table behind us shouts to me \"He apologized, get over it\", I said \"excuse me\", she repeats and then I tell her to \"mind your fucking business.\"  At that point, so as to not cause further scene, we get up and walk out and drive down the street to another establishment where we are seated, served, and cash out in less than the time we sat waiting to order at the first stop.  Roast me if I'm out of line.  Genuinely curious.\n\nEdit:  For clarity, the interaction of explaining my disappointment lasted about 45 seconds before the other customer chimed in.  Also for clarity, I interacted with one restaurant employee on each of the steps of this interaction.  No manager.  The guy that told us to sit was the same guy that I asked for menus, was the same guy that I asked to close out with, was the same guy that then came back without my check and offered the free meal.  \n\nEdit+:  I feel bad about losing my cool.

Went to local hole in the wall sports bar for dinner with pre-teen daughter.  No host, 1 bartender, 2-3 wait staff.  Told to seat ourselves and I ask if there is outdoor seating available.  Bartender says I think so, go check and see.  Nope, full.  Come back inside and find a table.  Sit there for 15+ minutes and no one swings by with menus or for drink orders despite serving tables adjacent to us.  I get up and walk up to bar and ask for menus ... a little irritated, but not especially rude to anyone.  Drinks and menus dropped to us a few minutes later.  Sit for another 25 minutes with no one asking to take our order, again despite service to other tables around us, including one that was seated and placed order within 5 minutes of coming in.  I flag bartender down as he cashes out the table next to us and ask for our check for the two drinks because we would like to go eat dinner somewhere else since we've been here 45 minutes and it doesn't seem like they really want us to eat here.  He says sure, comes back a couple minutes later and offers dinner \"on the house\".  I explain to him that I am not looking for a free meal, I am happy to pay, have been to this place many times with no issues and I don't understand why the service is so poor.  I just want to be treated like everyone else that seems like a regular around here.  He apologizes a couple of times and I am admittedly still a little hot, explaining to him why I am upset and why it isn't right.  Lady at the table behind us shouts to me \"He apologized, get over it\", I said \"excuse me\", she repeats and then I tell her to \"mind your fucking business.\"  At that point, so as to not cause further scene, we get up and walk out and drive down the street to another establishment where we are seated, served, and cash out in less than the time we sat waiting to order at the first stop.  Roast me if I'm out of line.  Genuinely curious.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My aunt paid property taxes on the house but my mom paid utilities, etc. \n\nRecently, heard the tail end conversation of my mom and aunt's conversation. Mom said that she wants the whole house to go to my brother and not 50-50. I was furious. That is not fair. How could my mother do this to me? We have a good relationship. When I asked her about it, she said how since its passed from your grandfather to my dad, then it should go to my dad to his son. Very traditional asian way of thinking. I've graduated university and will have a full time job. He is still in school (2 yrs older than me) and doesn't have a job. So its more likely that he would stay at the house longer than me.\n\nWe had a family dinner. After dinner, I see that my 3 aunts and my brother were no longer with the rest of the gang. I realize that they went away to a private room to sign papers that the house will eventually get put in his name after a year or so (since he has no money right now to pay property taxes, repairs if it comes up, etc). That's so shady. My aunts still have not talked to me about their reason for doing that. I just want them to communicate with me. Once they came back, then they ask to have a chat with me. Right then, I start crying so much. They said it was a collective decision with them and my mom. They respect what my mom wants to do and that family is very important to them.

I am forever thankful for them because they didn't have to do that. I have never asked anything more of them. However, now that there is a house being fully passed to my brother, I find it very unfair. They say shift my perspective and think about why my mom would want to do this. I am hurt that I am treated this way. I find out my mom was afraid I would just sell the house and leave my brother and mom with nothing. I would never just leave my mom with no place to stay.\n\nWas I being too greedy for asking the house to be in both mine and my brothers name? Was I being too emotional about it? With my mother, deep down I still love her, its just her decision is hard to accept. It was very hard for her to raise 2 children on her own. I know that. I respect and appreciate her very much.

Just mom, brother and me. The house we live in was my dads. After he died, it went into my aunts (dad's sister) name. My family continued to live there rent free. My aunt paid property taxes on the house but my mom paid utilities, etc. \n\nRecently, heard the tail end conversation of my mom and aunt's conversation. Mom said that she wants the whole house to go to my brother and not 50-50. I was furious. That is not fair. How could my mother do this to me? We have a good relationship. When I asked her about it, she said how since its passed from your grandfather to my dad, then it should go to my dad to his son. Very traditional asian way of thinking. I've graduated university and will have a full time job. He is still in school (2 yrs older than me) and doesn't have a job. So its more likely that he would stay at the house longer than me.\n\nWe had a family dinner. After dinner, I see that my 3 aunts and my brother were no longer with the rest of the gang. I realize that they went away to a private room to sign papers that the house will eventually get put in his name after a year or so (since he has no money right now to pay property taxes, repairs if it comes up, etc). That's so shady. My aunts still have not talked to me about their reason for doing that. I just want them to communicate with me. Once they came back, then they ask to have a chat with me. Right then, I start crying so much. They said it was a collective decision with them and my mom. They respect what my mom wants to do and that family is very important to them. I say that it is very traditional and outdated way of thinking that it should be passed down only to the son. I plead with them that it is unfair how I have worked hard up until now with barely any guidance from either parents (mom was present, but no parental guidance), and my brother has not done much and he gets an asset.

Roommate let my baby Bear out the door... he's gone. She asked me where Bear was before leaving for DND, I thought it was weird cuz she's never asked about the ferrets location before. She'd been in and out the house multiple times that day, I figured he fell asleep somewhere. An hour later when he still wasn't around, I called him and he didn't come which wasn't like him. I worried he slipped out when she had the door open, but had no proof. Well at 10:30pm my neighbor comes running to me, he had spotted my ferret in the bushes. I spent 2 hours outside searching for him to no avail. I told my roommate not to come home cuz I didn't want to go off on her. She said she didn't do it on purpose, I told her I know that but I was having a breakdown and it was for our safety. She agreed and asked me to put her kitten in the carrier so her older cat didn't harm it cuz they don't get along, I said yeah and thought that's it. She then asked if the kitten was okay. I almost lost it, her kitten was inside, safe while my ferret was outside in danger.

That I knew it was an accident but there's a difference between an accident that couldn't be avoided and an accident that was caused from carelessness. She knew the ferrets were out and didn't watch so she was at fault and therefore it was necessary to cover the cost. She's lucky that's all I ask of her cuz my animals are a huge source of my mental health. She needs to find a job and that she has caused me stress for the last 4 months and I can't do it, I can't support us both on a part time payroll, and she would be very unlikely to find anyone else that would have allowed her to stay rent free for as long as I have. She needs to get a job by the first of the month or that's it.

She'd been in and out the house multiple times that day, I figured he fell asleep somewhere. An hour later when he still wasn't around, I called him and he didn't come which wasn't like him. I worried he slipped out when she had the door open, but had no proof. Well at 10:30pm my neighbor comes running to me, he had spotted my ferret in the bushes. I spent 2 hours outside searching for him to no avail. I told my roommate not to come home cuz I didn't want to go off on her. She said she didn't do it on purpose, I told her I know that but I was having a breakdown and it was for our safety. She agreed and asked me to put her kitten in the carrier so her older cat didn't harm it cuz they don't get along, I said yeah and thought that's it. She then asked if the kitten was okay. I almost lost it, her kitten was inside, safe while my ferret was outside in danger. I told her \"Now is not the time to be asking about your kitten when my ferret could die cuz you didn't watch the door when you knew they were out. I am sure she's fine.\" I blocked her cuz she always to get the last word in.\n\nI have no hope that my baby is okay. If something wild didn't get him the dogs my neighbors let out will grab him first. I went to my roommate who stayed at my Uncle's house. I said that I expected her to pay the cost of my ferret (230$), I didn't want to hear any grief or apologies about the ferret from her cuz her comment last night made it clear she had no remorse. That I knew it was an accident but there's a difference between an accident that couldn't be avoided and an accident that was caused from carelessness. She knew the ferrets were out and didn't watch so she was at fault and therefore it was necessary to cover the cost. She's lucky that's all I ask of her cuz my animals are a huge source of my mental health. She needs to find a job and that she has caused me stress for the last 4 months and I can't do it, I can't support us both on a part time payroll, and she would be very unlikely to find anyone else that would have allowed her to stay rent free for as long as I have. She needs to get a job by the first of the month or that's it. When she started getting checks she could pay her phone time, her bills and pet supplies but every other part of her check needs to come to me until I'm paid off. I went without money now it's her turn. She said she was getting a new phone not just time, I just said okay. She owes me over 1k$ right now, I'm going to write it down and expect her to sign it. I said she could be mad but considering the situation I have been civil and mature.\n\nShe didn't say anything but I could tell she was angry. I'm starting to feel guilty for demanding her to give me all of her checks until I'm paid off. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My father is severely mentally ill, and has been divorced from my mother for decades. \n\nI have been fulfilling a lot of the emotional and intellectual care needs of my siblings and parents since I was myself a young child.

The breakdown of my siblings and their circumstances is as follows: \n\n1. Eldest brother - passed away. \n2. Eldest sister - no care needs. \n3. Myself - physically and mentally ill and disabled. \n4. Younger brother - no care needs.\n5. Youngest brother - ASD and severely mentally ill.\n6. Youngest sister - ASD and pregnant.\n\nMy mother herself has recently self diagnosed as Autistic. My father is severely mentally ill, and has been divorced from my mother for decades. \n\nI have been fulfilling a lot of the emotional and intellectual care needs of my siblings and parents since I was myself a young child. However, since my mother self diagnosed as ASD earlier this year, she has declined to help with anything intellectual such as form filling or making phonecalls in regards to appointments, or benefits etc and has asked that I do so as I am \"better at it\". This is not just for herself, but for my youngest siblings. This has left me having to do all of this care for both siblings, my mother, and continue the care that I already have been doing for my father. \n\nToday I had a breakdown and told her I am struggling to cope with having to care for so many people, on top of being unwell myself, on top of also working full time. She had a meltdown and told me she can't work and be a carer, despite clearly expecting that I can do the same. My illness is triggered and worsened by stress and of course over the past year I have been under a lot of stress so have faced a physical decline. I myself also have an OCD diagnosis, and my intrusive thoughts are also triggered by stress and anxiety so my mental health has also declined. \n\nShe's told me that I am selfish for putting my needs above my siblings and ableist for not understanding that she is disabled and can't care for people in this specific way. I've tried hard to explain that it's all just too much and something has to give. I understand that she too has limitations, but I haven't had a single day of rest in months and I am at breaking point. Plus, they are her children, she chose to have a family, I did not. \n\nSo now I'm stuck wondering if my expectations are realistic or if I am really just being the arsehole here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have not been asking for special treatment in my house (i.e. turn the TV down, turn off the volume on video games, stop pestering our son so he stops squealing/screaming) except a couple times when all three where happening at the same time. Yes I feel like crap but that's not their fault and I don't think their entertainment and general daily activities should have to suffer with me.. Especially since there are a variety of things I can do to make myself less miserable including going to our room yo take a break from the noise. This morning I had my 3rd doc. app. where I finally got some antibiotics (was there from 10 am to 3 pm so I've been gone much of today.)\n\nWhen I got home from said appointment, my husband was laying on the couch cuddling with our son, and he mentioned having a sinus headache. All was fine until our son wanted to get up and play. Everytime he came into the living room/kitchen area and said anything loud enough that I could hear, my husband would sternly tell our son to go play in his room because he was being too loud but my husband has no problem with the loud fight scenes/gun fire on the tv. I mentioned that I can barely hear our son and his response was, \"well, I've been telling him to be quiet and I'm only telling him to go play when he makes my head hurt.\" After that he went from sternly telling him to yelling at him to go to his room. \n\nSince I got home our son has spent MAYBE an hour and a half in the living room in like 5 minute intervals. He has yelled once or twice since I've been home but not nearly as many times as my husband has told him to go to his room. \n\nI understand sinus headaches suck and my husband has taken 1 naproxen tablet (that a lot for him, he doesn't like taking pills,) and taken 1 hot shower to try and relieve the pressure. Didn't do anything for it before I got home, hasn't tried using our NettiPot, won't go to a doctor, and is insisting all lights be off except our sons light and the phone and TV he is currently glued to. Plus, he has a history of exaggerating his pain level to either get out of stuff or \"one-up\" me.

She made it worse for herself and you by deflecting to focus on the TV. When you told the joke, it cut deep because she's spoiled with material things and, instead of being honest with you, she put up a front to hide behind.\n\nNeither of you meant to hurt each other, or tried to hurt each other. There are just things happening that led to upset. Society puts a premium on material wealth. Yes, wealth matters because it provides freedom. Your family has enough wealth that you can all sit around and enjoy a family night in. Some families don't have enough wealth for parents to do that. Her family has enough wealth to buy her things others don't get. Enough that it's easy to dehumanize her with the poor little rich girl trope. But that's what happened.

Classes start 8/30. I noticed a few of my courses on Blackboard opened up yesterday and for my writing class, I finally saw the teacher I have. She is a grad student and clearly very young (like mid 20s probably). Which I guess is a thing with gen ed classes. No big deal. However, I also noticed that we have absolutely NOTHING up on the blackboard site for the class. No syllabus. No schedule. No assignments. So while I was hoping to get organized for the semester, I'm still waiting on this one class. This is a Tuesday and Thursday class so we start 8/31 but have no info for books, assignments, due dates, which is extremely stressful. \n\nSo, I emailed the teacher and asked her when we would be getting the basic information for the course. She said (I'm copy and pasting here): \"Hi OP, thanks for reaching out! I'm looking forward to meeting you and everyone else on the first day. I'm still working on the syllabus and schedule for this class--the same time my name popped up for you on Blackboard and the student services page is the same time I found out what classes I'm teaching and at what times. I'm hoping to have everything done by next weekend. In the meantime I can at least tell you that we won't be using any textbooks--we're reading articles that I'll be uploading PDFs of to Blackboard, so you don't need to worry about finding a book. See you on the 31st! - Teacher\"\n\nThis stressed me out even more because now I just have to wait until next weekend, literally just a few days before class to see what's going on. None of my other instructors who are full professors are having this issue, they have all of their stuff up already. So I'm guessing this is because she is a grad student. However even though I know it's probably not all her fault (though I can't believe she didn't at least have a faint idea of what she was teaching so she could prepare ahead of time), I would prefer to deal with a professor who is more organized. I emailed her back asking if she could recommend a full professor who's class I can switch to. She then said she doesn't know who is teaching what and what classes are open, and that I could look on the registration website, but it would be unlikely to find an open section. She also said she hopes I decide to stay in the class. I saw another class that is full on the site so I can't register for it myself, so I contacted the department to see if I can get into that class instead of this one and listed my concerns about this teacher. The head of the department who I emailed said to wait until the first week of classes when people usually move around a lot. But that they would talk to the teacher and see what was going on. I emailed the teacher back and said I would be staying in the class for now and sorry for the trouble but she isn't responding.

Bear in mind that in everything I write below, I assume you're at a school with many graduate students.  Some of what I say applies to small liberal arts colleges, but not everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, you make the assumption that a graduate student simply by virtue of being a graduate student is likely to be a worse writing teacher than a 'full professor.'  You're only 18 and have no experience with higher education, so I'll chalk this up to naivety.  Professors typically get hired as 'assistant professors.'  After a probationary time (3-7 years depending on the institution), the person is either promoted to 'associate professor,' a permanent position, or let go.  This promotion is called getting tenure, and it is based in \\*part\\* on teaching observations and evaluations, but overwhelmingly on the quality and quantity of the person's scholarly publications.  Once they have tenure, they can choose to pursue a further promotion to 'full professor,' but most either don't pursue it or don't achieve it, because this is exceptionally difficult.  Unlike being granted tenure, becoming a full professor usually doesn't involve any evaluation of one's teaching at all, but rather is based on a combination of 'service,' which is basically how useful someone is to the department and to the school in general (serving on various committees, bringing in grants, being a prominent public face, etc.) and, again, publications.  You need to show that you're someone the institution can't afford to lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing: because promotions have almost nothing to do with the quality of one's teaching and because teaching well takes an amazing amount of energy and time, the higher up a person gets in the academic ladder, the less teaching they tend to do.  Moreover, since their focus in on their research, they also are incentivized to put very little effort into designing their courses and trying out new pedagogical methods.  Graduate students, on the other hand, usually have intensely studied cutting-edge in instructional design and learning strategies.  Where the subject matter is something like writing, you have a much higher likelihood of getting an outstanding teacher if you take a course taught by a graduate student than if you take a course taught by a full professor.  Indeed, it would be extremely unusual for a full professor to be teaching such a low-level course.  In most cases, the courses taught by full professors will be upper-level ones, designed for juniors and seniors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, you assume that your courses should be fully designed and completely available before the term starts -- ten days before it starts!  There's no reason to expect this.  The term starts on the 31st.  That's when the course will be available.  If other instructors make their courses visible on Blackboard before then, that's their business, but it certainly is not necessarily.  Moreover, as you can see in the email you quote from your teacher, she only found out she was teaching the course a day or two before you contacted her.  On the basis of her email, you say 'I can't believe she didn't at least have a faint idea of what she was teaching so she could prepare ahead of time' and that 'I would prefer to deal with a professor who is more organized.'  What about her email makes you think she is lying or disorganized?  I see no indication from what you quoted that she is anything less than a total professional, taking in stride what must be, for her, a very stressful situation.  I've been in her position before, many times in fact.  Once, I was assigned a course literally the night before it was to meet for the first time and had less than twelve hours to prepare for it.  Shit happens.  Maybe the person originally scheduled to teach the section got sick.  Maybe more students enrolled in the writing courses and her boss (could be department chair, director of first-year writing, director of undergraduate studies, etc.) decided to create a new section.  You don't know why she only found out a few days ago, and, frankly, it's none of your business why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(On a side note, if you think this is being disorganized, you're in for quite a rude awakening once you start taking upper level courses.  More than once as an undergrad and as a graduate student I took courses from BIG NAME professors, luminaries in their fields, and didn't see a syllabus at all until halfway through the term.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, there's more than a hint of sexist bias in what you write.  You don't say why you think your instructor is 'clearly very young,' but since that statement comes directly after you identify her as female.  Would you have sent an email to her department chair if the instructor were a male grad student?  Would you have implied a male grad student was disorganized and unprofessional if they'd sent that email?  Realize that women get called unprofessional all the time, every day, for doing and saying things that would be unremarkable if a man had done or said them.  Realize that women get judged to be inexperienced and untrustworthy for doing and saying the same things that men get judged to be energetic and passionate about for doing and saying.  Are you freaking out about this instructor for reasons that make sense, that \\*actually\\* give you cause for alarm?  Or is part of your upset here deriving from an unconscious bias that predisposes you to hold women to a different standard than men?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource for all I'm saying: 14 years teaching in higher education.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s.

I understand you're fresh out of hs so you don't know how academia works. So here's a quick rundown:\n\n1) No, grad students  don't even have a 'faint idea' what they'll be teaching. They list 6-7 courses they could teach, and two weeks before class they get an email 'you've been assigned to course X' -- which often is NOT their area of research, and they have to scramble to figure out how to put together a good class. (Does this sound crazy? IT IS. Plenty unis see grad students as just cheap minions to be used to make professors' lives easier.)  \n\n2) The reason full professors 'have all of their stuff up already' is because they've taught the same courses for years, so it takes 1 minute to change the syllabus year and throw it up on Blackboard. Also, 'full professor' means something other than what you think it means. Be shocking beyond belief if even one of your freshman intro courses was taught by a full prof. You're probably getting assistant profs or adjuncts, and I guarantee you they're all recycling their old courses because no one likes to spend time on this sh\\*t\n\n2.2) First year teaching a class comes with a HEAP of overhead work, so it's not surprising at all it's taking this woman a while to figure out the syllabus. You should be encouraged by the fact that she's putting thought into it; it'll make for a much better experience.\n\n3) YTA for reporting her to the department head before even STARTING FRESHMAN YEAR omg. I promise you that your name is now bandied about the department as a ridiculously entitled problem-student. Don't do that again. Your instructors job isn't to set themselves on fire to make your life more convenient; most have been struggling with teaching in three different formats for the past year and a half, and having some random kid show up demanding the syllabus weeks in advance isn't helpful. Remember they are also people and teaching is NOT their main responsibility. \n\n4) Literally, unlike in hs, most of your instructors in college were NOT hired to teach. Profs were hired to do research and write grants. Grad students were hired to learn how to do research and write grants and dissertations. Teaching is waaay low on the priority list. (Unless this is a teaching-focused college, but those are unlikely to have grad students teaching). \n\nTLDR: YTA.

Classes start 8/30. I noticed a few of my courses on Blackboard opened up yesterday and for my writing class, I finally saw the teacher I have. She is a grad student and clearly very young (like mid 20s probably). Which I guess is a thing with gen ed classes. No big deal. However, I also noticed that we have absolutely NOTHING up on the blackboard site for the class. No syllabus. No schedule. No assignments. So while I was hoping to get organized for the semester, I'm still waiting on this one class. This is a Tuesday and Thursday class so we start 8/31 but have no info for books, assignments, due dates, which is extremely stressful. \n\nSo, I emailed the teacher and asked her when we would be getting the basic information for the course. She said (I'm copy and pasting here): \"Hi OP, thanks for reaching out! I'm looking forward to meeting you and everyone else on the first day. I'm still working on the syllabus and schedule for this class--the same time my name popped up for you on Blackboard and the student services page is the same time I found out what classes I'm teaching and at what times. I'm hoping to have everything done by next weekend. In the meantime I can at least tell you that we won't be using any textbooks--we're reading articles that I'll be uploading PDFs of to Blackboard, so you don't need to worry about finding a book. See you on the 31st! - Teacher\"\n\nThis stressed me out even more because now I just have to wait until next weekend, literally just a few days before class to see what's going on. None of my other instructors who are full professors are having this issue, they have all of their stuff up already. So I'm guessing this is because she is a grad student. However even though I know it's probably not all her fault (though I can't believe she didn't at least have a faint idea of what she was teaching so she could prepare ahead of time), I would prefer to deal with a professor who is more organized. I emailed her back asking if she could recommend a full professor who's class I can switch to. She then said she doesn't know who is teaching what and what classes are open, and that I could look on the registration website, but it would be unlikely to find an open section. She also said she hopes I decide to stay in the class. I saw another class that is full on the site so I can't register for it myself, so I contacted the department to see if I can get into that class instead of this one and listed my concerns about this teacher. The head of the department who I emailed said to wait until the first week of classes when people usually move around a lot. But that they would talk to the teacher and see what was going on. I emailed the teacher back and said I would be staying in the class for now and sorry for the trouble but she isn't responding. My parents said \"way to go, you probably got her in trouble\" and now I'm wondering if that was an AH move or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I generally get along with everybody and we go back a long time. \n\nOne of the group\u2019s members Jake has anxiety and pretty severe insecurity problems. He\u2019s not a bad guy by any means, but he does tend to project his insecurities pretty often. For example, he\u2019ll often complain that every time he feels excluded when he\u2019s the one isolating himself, or bring others down when they\u2019re complimented in public. At his worst he\u2019ll be openly disrespectful to people who aren\u2019t really talking to him or about him- and that\u2019s when I draw the line. \n\nRecently Jake and my other friend, Ben had an argument. And whenever Jake has even a slight disagreement with you he has a nasty habit of raising his voice to the point of eventually yelling. Ben didn\u2019t appreciate this and matched Jake\u2019s level of hostility although half-jokingly. Then Jake proceeded to make a joke concerning Ben\u2019s height (or lack of) and Ben replied with \u201cbut if I mention your weight you\u2019ll get salty\u201d and Jake left the call and left a message saying that his mental health was not good and he needed a little bit of time to sort it out. \n\nThen later we all got on to talk about it. I was surprised to see most of the attention turned to Ben and what he could\u2019ve done to not set off Jake rather than instead focusing on Jake\u2019s habitual toxic patterns. \n\nMy view was that no matter what mental health struggles you might have- you don\u2019t get a pass to disrespect others. In a similar vain, you also can\u2019t roast others and not expect similar roasts back. If you are willing to joke about someone\u2019s bodily dimensions- you should expect one about yours. \n\nMy friends countered with saying that Jake\u2019s weight was something that triggered him, and shouldn\u2019t be joked about. So when he roasts Ben\u2019s height, it\u2019s more appropriate to joke about something else that Jake is comfortable with. \n\nEventually most of the group agreed with me, with two holdouts vehemently arguing that despite Jake being in the wrong, jokes shouldn\u2019t be made toward him about topics he doesn\u2019t like, because fat jokes are his \u201ctrigger.\u201d which I found unbelievably offensive to people who actually have a history of triggers like childhood abuse or PTSD- not just being a bit of a fatty.\n\nBut whatever I can agree to that- as long as he doesn\u2019t joke about those topics himself. I\u2019m a bigger lad myself and I don\u2019t mind fat jokes, and Jake sends plenty of them my way. And I often look the other way. But at any moment when he does that he can reasonably expect a similar joke directed his way. \n\nWe didn\u2019t ever agree, dropped the topic, but nothing was accomplished. Ben still felt slighted and I felt as if our entire discussion was spent on what Ben could\u2019ve dome to not set off Jake when in reality it\u2019s Jake who acted in bad faith. It felt like we were quietly siding with the abuser by focusing on what the person who reacted to said abuse could\u2019ve said better, and this has been a consistent problem we\u2019ve had. \n\nTL:DR; Friend wants the luxury of making jokes at other\u2019s expense but can\u2019t take jokes directed at him.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "PrecariousAchiuwa", "author_details": {"over_18": false, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 15036, "comment_karma": 6637, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 54.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p93pqy/aita_for_thinking_you_shouldnt_joke_about_topics/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 12, "NTA": 9, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 3}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I generally get along with everybody and we go back a long time. \n\nOne of the group\u2019s members Jake has anxiety and pretty severe insecurity problems. He\u2019s not a bad guy by any means, but he does tend to project his insecurities pretty often. For example, he\u2019ll often complain that every time he feels excluded when he\u2019s the one isolating himself, or bring others down when they\u2019re complimented in public.  \n\nRecently Jake and my other friend, Ben had an argument. And whenever Jake has even a slight disagreement with you he has a nasty habit of raising his voice to the point of eventually yelling. Ben didn\u2019t appreciate this and matched Jake\u2019s level of hostility although half-jokingly. Then Jake proceeded to make a joke concerning Ben\u2019s height (or lack of) and Ben replied with \u201cbut if I mention your weight you\u2019ll get salty\u201d and Jake left the call and left a message saying that his mental health was not good and he needed a little bit of time to sort it out. \n\nThen later we all got on to talk about it. I was surprised to see most of the attention turned to Ben and what he could\u2019ve done to not set off Jake rather than instead focusing on Jake\u2019s habitual toxic patterns. \n\nEventually most of the group agreed with me, with two holdouts vehemently arguing that despite Jake being in the wrong, jokes shouldn\u2019t be made toward him about topics he doesn\u2019t like, because fat jokes are his \u201ctrigger.\u201d which I found unbelievably offensive to people who actually have a history of triggers like childhood abuse or PTSD- not just being a bit of a fatty.\n\nBut whatever I can agree to that- as long as he doesn\u2019t joke about those topics himself. I\u2019m a bigger lad myself and I don\u2019t mind fat jokes, and Jake sends plenty of them my way. And I look the other way. But at any moment when he does that he can reasonably expect a similar joke directed his way. If you can\u2019t take it, don\u2019t dish it. \n\nWe didn\u2019t ever agree, dropped the topic, but nothing was accomplished. The group has a de-facto leader that plans everything and sets boundaries and Jake purposefully tried to get on his good side to secure discord mod rights and that ensures that his behavior will continue to be tolerated. \n\nTL:DR; \u201cfriend\u201d wants the luxury of making jokes at other\u2019s expense but can\u2019t take jokes directed at him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She\u2019s an alcoholic and made my childhood miserable because of it. She regularly harasses me for money to the point that I\u2019ve had to block her number and social media accounts. She doesn\u2019t have a place of her own, and constantly moves around with my little sister (9f) to live with whatever guy she\u2019s dating at the time. I really can\u2019t stand being around her and she knows that. \n\nI recently found out that my mom submitted an application at my workplace. She knows that I work there, and I feel like that\u2019s the only reason she applied. I have a pretty good relationship with my boss and he came to me about it first. I was truthful and told him that I\u2019m not comfortable being around her, and that she has a history of being fired for drinking on the job. As a result, my mom didn\u2019t get the job. I admitted what I did to some family members, and my aunt (mom\u2019s sister) went off on me and told me that I\u2019m a POS for interfering like that, that my mom really needs this job so she can support herself and my little sister, and I took that away when there aren\u2019t many other opportunities. Hearing this made me feel guilty because now feel like I put my comfort above my little sister. AITA for what I did?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Every \u201cset of 2\u201d shares an entranceway and on the top, shares a staircase. So I live on the second floor, therefore I share a staircase and entranceway with my neighbor. He\u2019s a friendly guy and we\u2019ve talked a handful of times. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem: he likes to sit at the top of the staircase and smoke weed. I truly don\u2019t care about what he\u2019s smoking, but he ALWAYS leaves his rillo wrappers and other paraphernalia littered on our shared entranceway. He plays music pretty loud and sometimes has a friend join him. I can hear his music through my door and his voice if he\u2019s talking, even at a \u201cconversational level\u201d. \n\nI should also mention that we are very lucky to have massive balconies. I\u2019m talking that for our floor plan, the measurements are 9ftx5ft and that\u2019s not including a closet that can either have W/D or be used as storage. On my balcony, I\u2019m able to fit a small table with 2 chairs, and still have enough room for my 120lb dog to stretch out comfortably. Some people have entire couches. So yeah, the balcony is one of the best amenities in this particular complex. \n\nSo here\u2019s the problem. Not only can I hear his music and see his trash, but my dog is getting older and his vision isn\u2019t that great. Sometimes when I open my door to walk him, my neighbor will be there and he catches my dog offguard. As mentioned earlier, the dog is big. He has a deep and intimidating bark. He only barks once and it scares the shit out of my neighbor. After he barks my neighbor always says \u201cdamn he hates me\u201d and then goes back into his apartment. Sometimes I have to ask him to move off the stairs so I can go down them. \n\nI also have a 3 month old puppy. Like most puppies, he puts everything into his mouth. Meaning that 10/10times, whatever trash my neighbor leaves ends up in the puppies mouth. \n\nIt might be worth nothing that the view from our balconies is a nice little patch of grass, and one of the tennis courts and a pool. The pool and court is far away enough that we can\u2019t hear the people using them. From the times I\u2019ve walked my dogs on that patch of grass, I can see that my neighbors balcony is completely empty. No lawn chair, nothing. It makes me wonder if his apartment is the same and that\u2019s why he has to use the stairs to sit /s. \n\nAnyway, I know my big dog would never bite him but I do always hold him by the collar now when I open the door because I don\u2019t want to risk anything. But I\u2019m sick of the loud noises, the trash, the smell of whatever he\u2019s been smoking, and him just being in the way. \n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I asked/suggested that he make use of his balcony? \n\nTL;DR: Even with a big balcony, my neighbor used our shared staircase to just chill and leaves a mess.", "label": 1.0, "community_ranking": "Not an Asshole", "author_fullname": "Throwaway1285bye", "author_details": {"over_18": true, "user_is_banned": false, "free_from_reports": true, "total_karma": 148, "comment_karma": 16, "is_mod": false, "is_employee": false}, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "downvotes": 0.0, "upvotes": 47.0, "reports_total": null, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/p8u02e/wibta_if_i_asked_my_neighbor_to_use_his_balcony/", "comment_rating": {"total_comments": 12, "NTA": 9, "YTA": 0, "Neutral": 3}, "comment_details": [{"index": 0, "author": "Judgement_Bot_AITA", "content": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every \u201cset of 2\u201d shares an entranceway and on the top, shares a staircase. So I live on the second floor, therefore I share a staircase and entranceway with my neighbor. He\u2019s a friendly guy and we\u2019ve talked a handful of times. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem: he likes to sit at the top of the staircase and smoke weed. I truly don\u2019t care about what he\u2019s smoking, but he ALWAYS leaves his rillo wrappers and other paraphernalia littered on our shared entranceway. He plays music pretty loud and sometimes has a friend join him. I can hear his music through my door and his voice if he\u2019s talking, even at a \u201cconversational level\u201d. \n\nI should also mention that we are very lucky to have massive balconies. I\u2019m talking that for our floor plan, the measurements are 9ftx5ft and that\u2019s not including a closet that can either have W/D or be used as storage. On my balcony, I\u2019m able to fit a small table with 2 chairs, and still have enough room for my 120lb dog to stretch out comfortably. Some people have entire couches. So yeah, the balcony is one of the best amenities in this particular complex. \n\nSo here\u2019s the problem. Not only can I hear his music and see his trash, but my dog is getting older and his vision isn\u2019t that great. Sometimes when I open my door to walk him, my neighbor will be there and he catches my dog offguard. As mentioned earlier, the dog is big. He has a deep and intimidating bark. He only barks once and it scares the shit out of my neighbor. After he barks my neighbor always says \u201cdamn he hates me\u201d and then goes back into his apartment. Sometimes I have to ask him to move off the stairs so I can go down them. \n\nI also have a 3 month old puppy. Like most puppies, he puts everything into his mouth. Meaning that 10/10times, whatever trash my neighbor leaves ends up in the puppies mouth. \n\nIt might be worth nothing that the view from our balconies is a nice little patch of grass, and one of the tennis courts and a pool. The pool and court is far away enough that we can\u2019t hear the people using them. From the times I\u2019ve walked my dogs on that patch of grass, I can see that my neighbors balcony is completely empty. No lawn chair, nothing. It makes me wonder if his apartment is the same and that\u2019s why he has to use the stairs to sit /s. \n\nAnyway, I know my big dog would never bite him but I do always hold him by the collar now when I open the door because I don\u2019t want to risk anything. But I\u2019m sick of the loud noises, the trash, the smell of whatever he\u2019s been smoking, and him just being in the way. \n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I asked/suggested that he make use of his balcony? \n\nTL;DR: Even with a big balcony, my neighbor used our shared staircase to just chill and leaves a mess.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They went from not caring about what I do at night to wanting to put apps on my phone that reveal my location and restrict certain apps etc. \n\n\nRight now the rule I am most upset about is the rule where my phone has to go downstairs at 10 pm every night and I\u2019ll get it back in the morning. This is a problem for some reasons like I need my phone for my alarm and I need it to help me fall asleep otherwise I\u2019ll have a hard time sleeping. They said this was to \u201cmake sure I focus on school\u201d which I think is total bs and here\u2019s why. \n\nI\u2019ve always gotten good grades and I\u2019m on my way to becoming valedictorian so they don\u2019t have to worry about grades. They never had this rule before and I think it has something to do with my new boyfriend who they just don\u2019t want me to talk to at night. I turn 18 in about 6 months and I\u2019m treated like a child. My older sister was never treated this way and I\u2019m sure my younger brother won\u2019t be either. \n\nAnyway WIBTA If I told them this rule is really unfair?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Don\u2019t complain about it being unfair which it is.  You are almost an adult so be an adult and treat this like a negotiation.  Make the case that as an almost adult who is probably? Going to college next year, you need to take on more responsibility at managing your time.  This is the time for you to make some slip ups while still at home so that you learn.  Allow them to track you with location services so that they have the piece of mind of being able to see that you are where you said you would be.  Allow the, to see your grades online (they probably already have this access as most middle school and high schools have online access for parents).  By seeing your grades they will know that you are getting the grades that you say you are getting.  In return, you want your phone 7x24 so that you can use it for music and alarm functions.  If they notice issues, they should ask for a sit down meeting to discuss it with you.  No texting you while you are out saying why are you at the mall or no flipping out on every grade.  You are at the age where they need to assist you in becoming an adult as you are almost an adult.  You have to be able to focus on school and manage your distractions on your own, and senior year is your practice run at doing that before you go off into the world as an adult.  In 6 months when you turn 18, you are a legal adult where you can establish your own bank account, control your medical information, etc.  this needs to be in your own words, and you are asking for their help.  You should still have a curfew (it\u2019s their house) and some household rules, but managing your devices or even time with your boyfriend is only going to cause resentment because you are trying to become an adult.", "rating": "NTA - Not the asshole", "user_reports": [], "mod_reports": [], "score": 2, "comment_ups": 2}, {"index": 14, "author": "AggravatingPatient18", "content": "NTA it's your phone, you pay for it.

Female wondering she should stay or go after the lease is up in a year.  \nMy partner (42M) and I (30f) have been dating for about 8 years now. He knows I want to get married and have a kid, he has yet to propose. I\u2019ve brought up many times just eloping but, not I find myself feeling like I\u2019m just being used. He seems to be less and less interested in me. Everytime we have the same conversation he changes for a few weeks then goes back. He said it\u2019s not fair to keep pointing out that I\u2019ve sacrificed a lot for him ( moving across the country, taking on more than one job, help paying for his cat\u2019s chemo). He\u2019s acknowledged that it\u2019s eating me up that he hasn\u2019t proposed.\n\nhe says stupid shit like \u201cit\u2019s beneath me to pick up a second job\u201c or \u201cI\u2019ll leave that for you to do when you have more energy\u201c. he says he\u2019s joking and has in past conversations acknowledged how the comments come off as hurtful. Meanwhile I have two shit paying jobs because I have to start my field over with making connection. Our place is a mess constantly, he feels does most of the house work\u2026 which I think over the week might be true, but I work two jobs and go to grad school now. I try to clean but after I clean the bedroom for example he throws his dirty clothes on the floor. he says I\u2019m a hoarder but I swear most of the stuff we moved are his. He He does pay rent and there are moments when I see glimpses of the man I love. He does things like make me coffee in the morning and makes sure I take my morning meds. He takes care of the animals. He will make food(but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because he loves me or if it\u2019s because I have a weird disconnect when it comes to cooking and he\u2019d rather not have accidental food poisoning).   \nI know he\u2019s under stress too from going up for tenure and finally finishing his research.

By this time, my MIL had already gotten a new boyfriend and moved him and his three boys (twin 6 YOs and and 8 YO) into her house. She constantly brags to my husband and his 21yo brother about her \u201cnew family\u201d and her \u201c5 beautiful kids\u201d (her exact words) This kind of wording has upset my husband and BIL since the beginning but they kept brushing it off.

She would always make comments about us \u201cnot wanting her to be happy\u201d when we told her we felt too pressured and everything felt so fast and forced. \n   Well, now that my daughter is old enough to start understanding who people are, my MIL started referring to her BF as \u201cPapa *his last name*\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t like it when she first did it, so she switched it to \u201cGrandpa\u201d because she \u201cthought it was an issue with the word papa\u201d She also started referring to the other boys as my daughters \u201cuncles\u201d\n    It kept happening and finally we told her that our daughter has two grandpas and her BF is not her grandpa.

He has a brother who is 21, and then a 13 YO brother and 10 YO sister. His parents had been together for 25 years, and got divorced in August of 2020. In October of 2020 we had our first child! By this time, my MIL had already gotten a new boyfriend and moved him and his three boys (twin 6 YOs and and 8 YO) into her house. She constantly brags to my husband and his 21yo brother about her \u201cnew family\u201d and her \u201c5 beautiful kids\u201d (her exact words) This kind of wording has upset my husband and BIL since the beginning but they kept brushing it off. The entire beginning of her relationship we felt pressured to meet her new BF and accept him. We took it at our own pace, but always felt forced and rushed by how she acted about it . She would always make comments about us \u201cnot wanting her to be happy\u201d when we told her we felt too pressured and everything felt so fast and forced. \n   Well, now that my daughter is old enough to start understanding who people are, my MIL started referring to her BF as \u201cPapa *his last name*\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t like it when she first did it, so she switched it to \u201cGrandpa\u201d because she \u201cthought it was an issue with the word papa\u201d She also started referring to the other boys as my daughters \u201cuncles\u201d\n    It kept happening and finally we told her that our daughter has two grandpas and her BF is not her grandpa. We explained that if she grows up calling him grandpa on her own then we will support it, but we didn\u2019t agree that it needed to be pushed into her. And same for the boys being called uncles. \n   My MIL was very upset and accused us of trying to ruin her happiness. She says she wasn\u2019t forcing or pushing anything- rather just giving him a title for the time being. I understand she is happy, and he really is a nice guy that we get along with well. \n   She said \u201cif she is going to call him grandpa anyways why does it matter?\u201d She also says we should have said something sooner rather than waiting and that because we waited we are just trying to pick a fight. I feel like it\u2019s the principle of it all and I fear if we give an inch she will take a mile. I\u2019ve always had boundary issues with her, so I wonder if this is me over reacting?

Long story short is that my dad split from my stepmother (I was about 12, so my memories are a bit fuzzy, I think he cheated and then split, but could be the other way around) and got a woman pregnant. \n\nBefore she had given birth they split up and my dad went back to my stepmother (who I love and care for deeply, to be clear). For about a year we saw the baby, but one day my dad spoke to me and my brother (37m now) and said that the woman's new partner wanted to adopt the baby and he wanted our opinions. Being kids we didn't even consider the financial aspect and wanted to keep contact. To explain that, we were a fairly poor family (UK Northern mining town in the 1980s and very early 1990s),  and my dad thought the new dad to be would be able to give the baby a better life than he could manage.\n\nSo, that was that for years. \n\nThen in about 2009 I asked my dad for the babies surname, I knew his first name obviously. I said I didn't want to contact him, but with social media being such a big thing I figured I could look him up and just see how he was doing. Just so I knew he was happy, you know?\n\nAfter a few weeks my dad got back to me to say he had spoken to my stepmum and agreed to give me that information, but should it  have an affect on his marriage he wouldn't ever forgive me nor speak to me again. He said it was hard enough having to tell my half siblings with my stepmum about the baby, which I never asked him to do! Me and my brother had agreed to never mention it unless it had been brought up first.\n\nAnyhow. Having found out me and my brother looked up the baby (not so baby now) and saw his life was going well. We were happy.\n\nBut in the last few years I have felt a hole in my life, I want to know him. I want to go for a coffee or a pint and chat with him. But I also don't want to hurt my half siblings or my stepmum (I don't want to hurt my dad either, but the others are innocent in the scenario). \n\nI know the baby, when the adoption went through, had a letter from my dad put in his file so if he wanted to contact him he could. What I don't know is if he tried and my dad just ignored it for the sake of maintaining the peace with my stepmum.\n\nWith all that in mind. Would I be an asshole if I made contact?

Long story short is that my dad split from my stepmother (I was about 12, so my memories are a bit fuzzy, I think he cheated and then split, but could be the other way around) and got a woman pregnant. \n\nBefore she had given birth they split up and my dad went back to my stepmother (who I love and care for deeply, to be clear). For about a year we saw the baby, but one day my dad spoke to me and my brother (37m now) and said that the woman's new partner wanted to adopt the baby and he wanted our opinions. Being kids we didn't even consider the financial aspect and wanted to keep contact. To explain that, we were a fairly poor family (UK Northern mining town in the 1980s and very early 1990s),  and my dad thought the new dad to be would be able to give the baby a better life than he could manage.\n\nSo, that was that for years. \n\nThen in about 2009 I asked my dad for the babies surname, I knew his first name obviously. I said I didn't want to contact him, but with social media being such a big thing I figured I could look him up and just see how he was doing. Just so I knew he was happy, you know?\n\nAfter a few weeks my dad got back to me to say he had spoken to my stepmum and agreed to give me that information, but should it  have an affect on his marriage he wouldn't ever forgive me nor speak to me again. He said it was hard enough having to tell my half siblings with my stepmum about the baby, which I never asked him to do! Me and my brother had agreed to never mention it unless it had been brought up first.\n\nAnyhow. Having found out me and my brother looked up the baby (not so baby now) and saw his life was going well. We were happy.\n\nBut in the last few years I have felt a hole in my life, I want to know him. I want to go for a coffee or a pint and chat with him. But I also don't want to hurt my half siblings or my stepmum (I don't want to hurt my dad either, but the others are innocent in the scenario). \n\nI know the baby, when the adoption went through, had a letter from my dad put in his file so if he wanted to contact him he could. What I don't know is if he tried and my dad just ignored it for the sake of maintaining the peace with my stepmum.\n\nWith all that in mind. Would I be an asshole if I made contact? Do I have the right to maybe ruin people's life's just because I want to meet my brother? I don't know his life, I don't know if he knows he's adopted. Can I make that step? Is it wrong if I do? \n\nI think I would probably be TA, but I'm often hard on myself so I wanted someone else to judge. \n\nCheers all.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was kinda drunk the other day during a hangout session with some friends and I and was trying to roast a bunch of people. He got to me and he was obviously trying to hard and make it too personal with me. Tried making fun of me for being short and started saying my gf\u2019s ex was much taller than me and shit like that. He was tipsy and my gf\u2019s brother so I let it slide, begrudgingly, until one if the others guys egged me on to say something back. Well the combination of gf\u2019s brothers shit talk and getting egged in tipped me over.  \n\n\nSo I said\u201dI don\u2019t really need to say anything here. My short self is gonna be clapping his sisters big,fat asscheeks later tonight so I guess being short ain\u2019t all bad.\u201d And clap her big,fat asscheeks later that night I did. Well gf\u2019s brother did not like me saying that one bit and started yelling at me and all that shit. I told him if he couldn\u2019t handle the fire then he should stay out of the kitchen. Some more yelling from him ensued while I remained cool and calm. I didn\u2019t want to stick around any longer so I left.\n\nDidn\u2019t want tell my gf what happened and neither did her brother, for obvious reasons.

So here it is:\n\n20 years ago when I still had roommates I lived with three other guys and as you can guess it was a mad house. We stole each other\u2019s food constantly, place was a mess but overall we got along ok. One of our roommates however was definitely the \u201cpsycho\u201d of the group and when he drank it could get really bad. \n\nAs mentioned we stole each others food all the time, and usually locked any good stuff in our own locked cabinets or in our rooms. Well one week I forgot to lock my cabinet, and Psycho roommate gets in and eats several items of mine. I got pissed, he thought it was funny, and I (quietly) vowed revenge. A week passes, and Psycho comes home with Chinese take out, as I would later find out. I was in my room so he didn\u2019t know I was home.  I could hear he had a bag of something, and could smell  Chinese food. I then heard him go in his room and then he left the house. I found out later he went out drinking. \n\nSeeing my opportunity, I went into his room, which he left unlocked. I saw the food, ate all the orange chicken and left only the rice. I then went out for the night.  \n\nFast forward to the next morning.  I come home and find out that the Psycho came home drunk, blamed our other roommate for stealing his food, things escalated, and Psycho shot our roommate in the leg!  None of us knew he even had a gun!  Long story short, he was arrested, and my roommate spent 3 weeks in the hospital, but was ok. Psycho escaped an attempted murder charge but had to do 6 months for aggravated assault and discharge of a firearm in city limits. \n\nDuring this time, I moved out and never admitted to others that it was me that ate his food.

So here it is:\n\n20 years ago when I still had roommates I lived with three other guys and as you can guess it was a mad house. We stole each other\u2019s food constantly, place was a mess but overall we got along ok. One of our roommates however was definitely the \u201cpsycho\u201d of the group and when he drank it could get really bad. \n\nAs mentioned we stole each others food all the time, and usually locked any good stuff in our own locked cabinets or in our rooms. Well one week I forgot to lock my cabinet, and Psycho roommate gets in and eats several items of mine. I got pissed, he thought it was funny, and I (quietly) vowed revenge. A week passes, and Psycho comes home with Chinese take out, as I would later find out. I was in my room so he didn\u2019t know I was home.  I could hear he had a bag of something, and could smell  Chinese food. I then heard him go in his room and then he left the house. I found out later he went out drinking. \n\nSeeing my opportunity, I went into his room, which he left unlocked. I saw the food, ate all the orange chicken and left only the rice. I then went out for the night.  \n\nFast forward to the next morning.  I come home and find out that the Psycho came home drunk, blamed our other roommate for stealing his food, things escalated, and Psycho shot our roommate in the leg!  None of us knew he even had a gun!  Long story short, he was arrested, and my roommate spent 3 weeks in the hospital, but was ok. Psycho escaped an attempted murder charge but had to do 6 months for aggravated assault and discharge of a firearm in city limits. \n\nDuring this time, I moved out and never admitted to others that it was me that ate his food. To be honest I was actually afraid of what Psychos reaction would be and didn\u2019t think it was worth the risk. \n\nIt\u2019s 20 years later, I\u2019m in a different country, but actually still keep in touch with the roommate that was shot. I never told him the truth either and he still knows some people that know Psycho.

I got a fence put in for my dog and (for geological reasons) I purposely had them put the fenceline about 6 feet into my property. The neighbor behind me seized the back corner space as a garden, despite it being my property. I thought, whatever I dont have to trim the brush back there and the old lady gets a little more space.. cool.\nExcept turns out she's mean! She flagged me down and  said I was \"driving her FUCKING CRAZY\" with the grass from my fenceline creeping into her garden.. I was kind of shocked and apologized. I cleaned it up and try to keep it a little extra nice in the corner by her yard. Today she went off on me again about the fence line so I I got kind of passive aggressive and said \"sorry I'll take care of it\". I revved up the weed whacker and completely buzzed 1 foot of either side my fence.. this included 1 foot into her garden.  She hasn't said anything and has just mean mugged me when we are both outside. I feel like I could have handled that better but at the end of the day I pay for that property.\n\n Since I actually bought this house these are long term neighbors so idk how far I should go to make peace. I want to be a good neighbor but I also will not be bullied. AITA here??\n\nTLDR: my old neighbor grows a garden on what is clearly my property and I cut down a bunch of it because they complained about how I was maintaining my land.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My previous administrator was my grandmother, but she and I rarely interacted and she never handled any of my work reviews or speaking to me about anything related to my work on the floor. \n\nOur new Admin who was the floor manager pulled me aside and offered me a new position to assist our Resident Care Manager (RCM) in getting some of those duties done and having someone else get trained (our RCM is getting older and is viable for retirement soon). \n\nI asked to look over the duties and took home a job description. I looked it over and spoke with a few of my coworkers who I really trust about the position.

They are furious that they were not offered the position and that the M/NA didn't advertise - at least 4 of my coworkers have complained to me that they didn't have a chance to apply - but at the same time, everyone who has spoken to me has said they didn't want the job. \n\nAITA for taking the position that was offered to me?

I have worked in the medical field previously, but with minimal training (small towns = a lot of on the job training). \n\nThere have been a lot of shifting going on internally with administration, and there are duties being left open by there no longer being a floor mananger. My previous administrator was my grandmother, but she and I rarely interacted and she never handled any of my work reviews or speaking to me about anything related to my work on the floor. \n\nOur new Admin who was the floor manager pulled me aside and offered me a new position to assist our Resident Care Manager (RCM) in getting some of those duties done and having someone else get trained (our RCM is getting older and is viable for retirement soon). \n\nI asked to look over the duties and took home a job description. I looked it over and spoke with a few of my coworkers who I really trust about the position. I heard from them that there were multiple coworkers who were VERY upset that they were not offered the job. \n\nI spoke with the manager/new admin(M/NA) about if my taking the position would cause any issues or be a problem, as I didn't want to step on any toes. My M/NA told me that it would be fine and they wanted me to help as I had expressed interest and paid attention to detail (my bosses can read the notes I write about residents for state funding). \n\nI agreed to take the job and signed the paperwork, and set up when I would start training once the RCM got settled again (she had been out for a while). \n\nFlash to now - several weeks after I signed paperwork, I've heard several coworkers talking about quitting, and have cited the fact that I got offered the position as a major reason they want to leave the facility. They are furious that they were not offered the position and that the M/NA didn't advertise - at least 4 of my coworkers have complained to me that they didn't have a chance to apply - but at the same time, everyone who has spoken to me has said they didn't want the job. \n\nAITA for taking the position that was offered to me? I feel very guilty and am contemplating going to my       M/NA and telling her that I recind my acceptance and she needs to offer it to everyone in the facility. I want to work in this position, I think its interesting and very important, but I don't want there to be a mass exodus from the facility. Many of the people we care for have lived in this town their entire life and would not fair well in another facility. \n\nI feel like I could be the asshole because I accepted the job without telling my boss to let the others apply first. I also feel like I could be the asshole because at the time my grandmother was still acting as advising admin for the M/NA and there's talk of my name coming up only due to nepotism.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
