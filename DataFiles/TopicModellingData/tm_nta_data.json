Because of this, ive had INTENSE back pain, shoulder pain, etc growing up. \\n\\nStarting a few months ago, the pain had only gotten worse and worse- It seemed i couldnt go an hour without having to dramatically crack my back and swallow ibuprofen and still have to suffer pain. Ive tried yoga, stretching, exercising, and everything to try to eliminate back pain (i hoped that with a stronger core or something I'd be able to support my own chest), buy I've only found that it makes it worse.\\n\\nSo i did some research and found that a breast reduction was just what i needed- I thought about going down to a C cup or even a B. I wanted my back pain to be COMPLETELY gone. So, about a week ago, I brought up with my boyfriend (28M), thinking he'd take it well (he's always been supportive of me, so i trusted him) and he was PISSED. He told me that i was throwing away my body and \\\"caving in\\\" to \\\"societal pressure\\\". He said there was no reason to change my tit size, and that if i did, he wouldn't be attracted to me anymore. We argued about it for a good 2 hours before he tried to \\\"compromise\\\" with me and say he was alright with it as long as i didnt go below a D cup, because anything smaller than that was \\\"childish\\\". He also called me egotistical and self absorbed, asking me why i didnt talk to him about it sooner, or think he would care about it. I told him I didnt think he'd care so much about me changing MY body, and he stormed out of the room and has been passive aggressively ignoring me ever since, even to the extent that he wont say i love you back, or sleep in the same bed as me. \\n\\nSo, Reddit, i just need to know.

I told her that I am fine with anything as long there are vegetarian options available or at least chicken.\\n\\nThey brought their daughter Stef(15) to the dinner and she is a sweet little girl. Now Stef was really interested in me and she kept on asking me questions about how I look the way I look.

Plus I have a plant-based diet and home cooked meals so that helps and I also lift weights. Now Melissa overheard our conversation partially. She pulled me aside and told me that Stef was recovering from eating disorder so she encouraged me to be honest with her and not lie to her and not to order anything that screams \\u201cdiet!\\u201d\\n\\nWhen I saw the menu, there were little to no vegetarian options available. It didn\\u2019t have anything for me. I was very disappointed and made a comment that oh wow there are no vegetarian options. Melissa chimed in and said that eating meat once in a while won\\u2019t affect my weight. Now, when I say plant-based diet it\\u2019s not that I don\\u2019t eat meat but I only eat chicken maybe once a week as a side dish and certain types of fish occasionally but other than that I mostly eat vegetarian dishes.

It has nothing to do with my weight. \\n\\nWhen the waiter came in, I was still glued to my menu when all the others had already ordered. Melissa said that oh she will have the duck too and I interrupted and said that no I will have the garden salad(I hate salads but there were no other veg options). \\nMelissa got quiet.\\n\\nAfter a few mins she told me that I shouldn\\u2019t have lied and lead on her daughter if I was going to order a \\u201cskinny\\u201d salad and starve myself. She said that I am just like those IG influencers who lie to impressionable young girls about their food habits and bodies and I just proved that by ordering a salad after giving her daughter a \\u201cdon\\u2019t restrict yourself\\u201d speech and I probably triggered her eating disorder.\\n\\nI tried to explain that I only ordered a salad cuz there was no other option in the menu for me but then she said that I should have just sucked up and eaten the damn duck as it isn\\u2019t going to affect my weight but then again I corrected that it is a religious thing and not a diet thing.

His parents are from Osaka. He kind of sort of half speaks Japanese, mostly sentences he has memorized\\/greetings, and his parents speak great English. \\n\\nOn the other hand, I lived in Japan for three years, so I am conversationally pretty good. I have studied hard to get to the level I'm at, and I have passed level 2 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (not great, but not bad).\\n\\nLately, my husband is super into me calling him *goshujin sama*, which can be translated to \\\"my honored husband.\\\" It's extremely unusual to call your own husband this, as it is usually reserved for other people's husbands as a respectful term, but it's kind of an anime\\/Japanese geek culture thing. I was OK with it in private because it makes him happy.\\n\\nLast week went to his parents' house for dinner, and on the way over he asked if I could call him *goshujin sama* all evening. I immediately shot his idea down with a firm \\\"no,\\\" because that would be SUPER embarrassing. His parents are native Japanese speakers in their 60s. I'm not going to subject them to what you'd pay a waitress in a maid cafe $20 for a cup of coffee to call you. To be honest, I don't think my husband really gets how the phrase is properly used, despite his insistence.\\n\\nHe kept trying to convince me, reminding me that he is Japanese and knows what is proper (despite the fact that I speak better Japanese than him), but I was having none of it. I just shut down and tuned him out.\\n\\nWe got there, and some time into the night I called his name to ask if he wanted a drink. Despite him being in hearing range, he ignored me. I said it again, and this time he looked at me, gave me this pleading shrug, and then turned back to the TV. I didn't get him a drink and just got myself one.\\n\\nA while later, I said his name again, and he audibly sighed. He told me that he wanted me to call him what I call him at home, to which I responded I would most certainly not be calling him what I call him at home. This was ALL in front of his parents by the way.\\n\\nOn the car drive home, I told him that I wasn't going to call him *goshujin sama* anymore because he can't draw the line between fun playful couple stuff and his parents. He has sulked for the past week and I don't even know what to do. Normally I would not even consider the possibility that I was wrong here, but he's normally a very rational, reasonable, and respectful person. I feel like I'm being gaslighted and don't know what to do.\\n\\n**Edit:** thank you all for the comments. I haven't been responding but I have read almost all of them, and have taken your opinions to heart. With that said, I have determined that I was the asshole in this case. As some posters have noted, I am not ethnically Japanese, and it is wrong of me to assume I know more about Japan, Japanese marriages, and the Japanese language because of it. \\n\\nI talked to my husband and we agreed that I would continue calling him *goshujin-sama*. I told him I would need time and request his patience for doing it in public and in front of other people.

He wanted to hire someone else, but I begged him to hire her.\\n\\nI know how people are sometimes hurt but then they say \\\"..but I'm truly happy for you\\\". I honest to god don't think they mean it and when I say I'm happy for someone, I want to mean it. I'm not happy for my friend. I just am not. I can't make myself be. I told her as such and told her to stop contacting me. She's now blowing up my emails and DMs because she's so \\\"hurt\\\" by what I said to her.\\n\\nMy dad said that I should've just kept this to myself since I know my best friend is a sensitive person and is hurt. But what about me? Am I given a sensitivity pass because I've looked after my friend for so long. Do my feelings just stop mattering at some point?\\n\\nEDIT: My conversation with my best friend went as followed: She called me with the news and said that she didn't know how to tell me (didn't apologize FYI) and then she followed it up with how she's finally doing well and doesn't have to rely on my for money since she has a nice job and also a nice boyfriend. I told her I was not happy for her. I reminded her that I got her the job (she knew and was fine with it) and that I've done so much for her over the years and she thanks me by backstabbing me and getting with my ex. She knew that it would hurt me and if she'd done it when I was well-over him or with my permission, I'd feel differently. Then, I told her to not contact me again because clearly I'm her friend but she was never my friend and I want to stick with people who are supportive toward me and reciprocate my friendship. Then, I ended the call. \"},{\"index\":720,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I feel kind of bad, but I have a friend who thinks of herself as a highly popular mom influencer (she's in her 40s), and she has a habit of taking other people's posts, memes, etc and reposting them as her own.\\n\\nShe even steals personal, heartfelt words from other bloggers and Instagrammers about their struggles with body image, depression, etc and slightly changes them to repost as her own.

Haha\\n\\nEdit 2: Just to clarify - I had no idea she was going to post it. The whole point was that the photo didn't even have a cat in it... It was a joke. She posted it with a whole fake story AND tried to make people find the non-existent cat in the photo, which added hugely to her embarrassment. After she got mad, I even tried to help by suggesting she simply tell people she accidentally posted the wrong photo or even say it was a joke, but she locked down her profiles, which obviously made her look bad. None of our friends blame me, but she is seriously upset and is refusing to speak to me.

My husband got a call from her in the middle of the night and asked him if he could drop her at the hospital her brother was at (an hour away from us) since she was too scared to drive. My husband agreed, told me quickly while I was half-asleep and rushed out. \\n\\nA few hours later, I had contractions and called my husband. He didn't pick up after multiple tries so I gave up and called my Dad, who drove me to the local hospital (12 minutes away). I was so scared of giving birth alone since I've had about 3 miscarriages and 1 stillborn. \\n\\nMy husband promised me that no matter what, he'd be there for me. Guess what? He wasn't. We called multiple times while I was in labor and when he finally picked up my Dad's call when I was giving birth, saying that he'd misplaced his phone in the chaos, my Dad informed him that no matter how fast he drives anymore, he's going to miss the birth of his child. \\n\\nWell, my husband took that as \\\"he's already screwed up, so it doesn't matter when he shows up at this point\\\" so when he FINALLY came, our daughter was about 5 hours old and I'd already moved to the maternity ward. \\n\\nWhen he came, I refused to let him see our baby (edit: did let husband hold and play with baby after discharge) because I was so high on emotions and was shaking when I saw him and didn't want it negatively affect my time with the baby. I wanted her birth to be a happy time and I was already struggling to feed her. \\n\\nMy husband was in a bad state and told me to please let him see her, so I told him to stand by the window and held the baby up so he could see her. I told him to then leave and he'll be allowed to interact with the baby at my father's home when we're both well and out of the hospital and that I was most likely divorcing him. \\n\\nHe starting bawling and apologizing and defended himself by saying that Anna's brother was in serious critical condition and although he's fine, Anna needed him. Though Anna's parents were there, she's not that close with them and she was in an unbearable state. \\n\\nI told him that I didn't care and that his daughter has already come second to him and all she did was be born. I'm putting my daughter's and my health first and won't let her be sidelined. My husband agreed and left. However, Anna called me later and said that I was being controlling and she'd never met someone as cruel as me for not letting a father see his baby. I told her that my husband made his decision and that this was his doing not mine. \\n\\nBut now, I can't help feel cruel in my actions and feel like I'm depriving my baby of both her parents being together. My husband sees her a few hours each day now. AITA?\\n\\nEdit: I feel like this is useful information and could explain why I was so mad. \\n\\nAnna\\u2019s brother was not in a life\\/death situation. He had serious injuries, but most were concentrated on his legs and arm. He did have a concussion but gained consciousness soon. Anna was there along with both her parents who managed all the hospital stuff. My husband was there as a emotional support for Anna. \\n\\nI did let my husband see our baby, right after I got discharged (Edit: husband saw baby, husband held baby, husband played with baby). I wanted a couple days of rest and bonding with the baby since my emotions were so high and I was afraid if my husband was a continuous presence, I\\u2019d get stressed and something bad would happen. I told him as such. They spend time together, but I\\u2019m still cold with him. \\n\\nI may still be the asshole, I don\\u2019t know, but I\\u2019m still so mad at him and it\\u2019s not the first time he put Anna before me. I can forgive the other times since I could handle it but this time was the straw. I was so scared to hold my baby because I was paranoid the minute I touch her, something would happen to her and no one was there to comfort me. I only had my dad but he wasn\\u2019t in the delivery room which is why i\\u2019m not too keen on forgiving my husband.\\n\\nAlso, we both knew the baby was due anytime now so I don\\u2019t understand why my husband didn\\u2019t have his phone on him. We even tried reaching out to Anna and she didn\\u2019t pick up either.\\n\\nAfter he learned I was giving birth, they already knew that Anna\\u2019s brother was going to be alright. He spent that time making sure that Anna was okay and feeding her and then waiting for the brother to regain consciousness. He could\\u2019ve come back after seeing his daughter to talk with the brother. He would\\u2019ve made it back in time.\\n\\nEdit: So many of you got it wrong. I\\u2019m not preventing him from EVER seeing his baby, that is stupid and unreasonable. He literally saw her about a day later when we were discharged and safely at my dads home. He already didn\\u2019t see her for 5 hours on purpose and put Anna first, I didn\\u2019t think an additional day would make much of a difference. And it wasn\\u2019t to him, he was happy to see the baby and he spends time with her all the time. She\\u2019s two months now.\\n\\nAnd also, I\\u2019m not mad about the fact he went to see Anna, I\\u2019m mad that he didn\\u2019t think we were a high priority to rush back to. He left me so quickly in the middle of the night when I was already late, he couldn\\u2019t have left Anna in the care of her parents and rushed as soon as possible? She\\u2019s not a child and she doesn\\u2019t have any mental health issues either.\\n\\nEdit 3: So sorry for all the edits! But someone just messaged me this: What if my baby was born a stillborn again? He had no way to know since he and I didn\\u2019t have ANY contact after I gave birth. Thank the stars, my baby is healthy and well but it was a possibility.\\n\\nEdit\\/Update: Thank you everyone for your replies. I think that I was an asshole for using my child against him and should have told him that he could hold and then asked him to leave. \\n\\nSo the divorce is probably going to happen. My brother is looking at lawyers for me. \\n\\nIn the midst of this whole mess, this post made me realize I never checked on Anna\\u2019s brother to see how he\\u2019s healing because I was so irked by Anna. I called him and he said that he was doing well and will be out of his wheelchair soon. He asked about me and the baby and how I was doing with the split and if I was okay with my husband and ... Anna. \\n\\nI can\\u2019t believe I was so oblivious. I thought they had an emotional thing going on because of this and when I confronted my husband, he denied it and said me and our baby were his priority and he made a \\u201cmistake\\u201d and he was being dumb. \\n\\nYea no, Anna\\u2019s brother kindly informed me that he and Anna\\u2019s parents thought that my husband and I split when I was 7 months pregnant and that Anna and him were back on. He showed up at the hospital as Anna\\u2019s boyfriend which is why they didn\\u2019t bat an eye that he was there and not with his pregnant wife. Because apparently we split. Her brothers procedures were done well before the afternoon so I don\\u2019t know that my husband and Anna were doing for all those hours, but I don\\u2019t even wanna know. If you want more details, I can answer in a comment. \\n\\nThanks everyone for your kind words and advice. I will be moving back home and filing for full custody. I don\\u2019t want my baby growing up to be like her father or Anna. He can be fun dad or whatever it is he wants to be.\\n\\nLast edit: I think i\\u2019m going to be taking a break from reddit now because ranting on the internet doesn\\u2019t seem healthy.

After graduation, we were semi-long distance, living close enough that we alternately visited almost every weekend. In 2018, Anne got a job in my city, and we found a place and moved in together.\\n\\nNow\\u2019s a good time to mention the security cameras in our house: break-ins are unfortunately common where we live. We thus got some motion activated cameras, one of which has a view of our kitchen (to monitor the back door). The cameras only record when there\\u2019s motion so they can retain footage for a very long time. Anne of course knows this.\\n\\nAbout a year ago, Anne started complaining I wasn\\u2019t contributing equally to chores. I\\u2019ve been obsessive about chores my whole life; growing up, not doing the dishes meant no videogames for a week. When I lived with roommates, I was always the chore Nazi, making damn sure we all stuck to our chore wheel. Anne is just as fastidious about chores, so we just naturally alternated who did what.\\n\\nI\\u2019d just been brushing her remarks off, but over the last few months they\\u2019ve become much more aggressive, e.g. I was vacuuming and Anne said \\u201clook at you finally cleaning up around here!\\u201d I replied that we alternated vacuuming, to which she retorted \\u201cno, you\\u2019ve vacuumed maybe twice since I moved in.\\u201d Exchanges like this have been happening so frequently that I began to doubt my own recollection; am I not as clean as I thought?\\n\\nFinally, she exploded at me last week. She said that having to stay home constantly over the past weeks exposed how little I do around the house, and that she didn\\u2019t move in just to be my maid. Questioning my own sanity, I spent a few hours going through the entire 1.5 year archive of security camera footage, and tallied the exact number of times the kitchen cam caught each of us doing dishes. Our cleaning supplies (vacuum\\/mop\\/etc.) are in the kitchen pantry, so I also tallied up how many times we grabbed cleaning stuff.\\n\\nTo my vindication, the tally showed that we indeed split chores equally. She vacuumed\\/mopped \\\\~5 more times than I did; I did dishes \\\\~20 more times than she did. Given that we vacuum\\/mop at least once a week and do dishes at least every day, these are insignificant differences over the year and a half we\\u2019ve lived together.\\n\\nWhen I confronted Anne, she shrugged off her behavior as \\u201cremembering things differently,\\u201d but the real sin here was what *I* did, which she called an \\u201cunforgivable violation of *her* privacy,\\u201d akin to abusive stalking.

But she insisted no, she wanted our garlic bread, just without garlic. I let her know she could just order regular bread and it would be a dollar less, but she insisted she had a huge craving for garlic bread without the garlic. I wasn't really sure what to do, but her husband got angry and said something like \\\"Can't you see that she's pregnant? It's not that hard to just bring out garlic bread without garlic.\\\"\\n\\nSo I took their order and told the kitchen she wanted garlic bread without the garlic. Kitchen staff thought I was being snarky, but brought out the regular bread for her. She immediately starts crying and asking me if I was treating her like an idiot. How could I treat a pregnant woman so badly? Is it that hard to make garlic bread without garlic? But literally, we do nothing different to our garlic bread except use garlic butter instead of regular butter. Her husband flagged down a manager telling me, I was being condescending and that his wife had been craving this all week but garlic was making her nauseous.\\n\\nThe manager came over, and I explained what was going on. The manager apologized and took the bread back and told me to just bring out another loaf of bread with garlic butter on the side. I was a little annoyed, but I did it, and gave it to them. The husband got angry again, told the manager I was being intentionally difficult and cruel, then left with his wife (who ate the garlic free garlic bread, using the garlic butter).\\n\\nThis just feels bizarre to me. Both me and my manager weren't really sure how to handle this. AITA for bringing out regular bread when the woman ordered garlic free garlic bread?\\n\\nEdit: To clarify, it's a focaccia loaf. The regular and garlic bread are baked the exact same way. It's just that one uses garlic and the other doesn't\\n\\nEdit 2: To clarify further, the lady says she had been to the restaurant before. She was completely aware of what our garlic bread contained. She was specifically craving our garlic bread, which is a flat focaccia with salt, herbs, butter, and garlic. Our regular bread is the exact same thing with no garlic (so it has the salt, herbs, and butter). They are both served warm. The bread isn't toasted like Texas toast style garlic bread. The focaccias are pretty flat, so you can't really toast it, but the crust is still pretty crunchy and buttery.\"},{\"index\":704,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"Backstory:My mom died when I was like 4 and my dad remarried when I was 6.

At first when we all moved it I was happy to have siblings, but the feeling wasn't mutual at all and they excluded me a lot from things. Saying that I'm \\\"not one of them\\\" and other crap like that. Me and the 17yo fought A LOT like almost daily, nothing too bad just dumb kid stuff. Our parents nipped that in the bud but arguments with him were daily till i was like 13 and just gave up. The 18yo HATES me, cause of me and her brother fighting a lot and same with the 15yo. My dad and step mom tried to make us all one blended family but it just didn't work, I was open to it but they were intent on just blocking me out. Around 12 I just stopped trying and did my own thing, I have absolutely 0 relationship or attachment with any of them.  \\n\\nMain problem:  I was away at a friends house and I forgot to lock the door to my room.

Please don't repost this somewhere else (my mom doesn't have Reddit but does have Instagram, etc. and I don't want her to find this as I do give out some identifiable details. Thank you!)**\\n\\nI (24F) and my fiance (24M) have been together since our sophomore year of college, so around 5 years now.\\n\\nFor context, my mom (50F) had an affair with a coworker when I was 16, leading to my parents' divorce. She has been single ever since (going on dates but no serious relationships). I have a good relationship with my dad and his new wife. Sadly, my fiance's mom passed 2 years ago due to cancer and his dad (53M) has been single since.\\n\\nMy fiance proposed last year but our wedding was delayed due to COVID. Our families had never met up to this point because his family lives in South Carolina, whereas we're in North Carolina (where we went to college), around a 3 hour's drive away from his dad. 3 months ago, in January 2021, we decided that it was time to have our families meet for the first time to discuss our upcoming wedding in June 2021 (held in our backyard, COVID appropriate, immediate family only). My dad and his wife, my fiance's dad, and my mom all met at our place to meet and discuss the wedding. This went well, albeit there was some tension between my mom and my dad.\\n\\nThis morning, out of the blue, my mom called me and announced that she had eloped. I was shocked as she had not been dating anyone to my knowledge. Upon questioning, it turns out that she and my fiance's dad had been dating in secret since that meeting in January and had married in secret yesterday, making my fiance my \\\"stepbrother\\\" (I want to throw up just thinking about this). She said that I should now cancel my wedding because it would be inappropriate to marry my \\\"stepbrother.\\\"\\n\\nI'm absolutely horrified. I shouted at my mom, saying she \\\"just loves ruining my life\\\" and called her selfish - first she cheated on my dad, and now she went and married my fiance's dad, knowing full well I was about to marry my fiance.\\n\\nMy mom then said I was still young and I'd have the chance to meet someone new, but she's old and \\\"has to take every opportunity she's got,\\\" and so I was an ungrateful b\\\\*tch for not approving of her \\\"marriage\\\". She then accused me of wanting her to die alone.\\n\\nI don't think I'm the asshole, but I just wanted to make sure because ultimately I don't want her to have to be alone even though I think she did that to herself by hurting my dad. I think I should be allowed to marry my fiance as we met first. I'm also 12 weeks pregnant with my fiance's kid so that complicates matters more (we haven't told anybody yet).\\n\\nAITA for being mad about my mom marrying my fiance's dad and because she said I can't marry my fiance anymore?\\n\\n**Edit: I don't know much about whether it's legal to marry your \\\"stepbrother\\\" so if someone could confirm that would be great.**\\n\\nEDIT 2: Mini update, we just called his dad. Apparently, he sees no issue with my fiance and I staying together, it was my mom who had an issue. Honestly, I still don't know how to feel about this because this still feels kinda gross to me.

Whenever anything regarding spending money comes up she will always say how broke we are and she doesn't have the money to do this or buy that. The thing is we are doing well financially. We have decent jobs and combine our salary is roughly $125k\\/yr.\\n\\nAs of today our net worth is more than $1 million but less than 2. I had saved\\/invested a lot before getting married so I gave us a good head start. I control the finances\\/take the lead but we both agreed to living a very modest life. We both have our cars from college for example (Honda &amp; Toyota). She knows everything about our finances because at least once a month I go over it with her every time I deposit money in our investment accounts or our kids college funds. For banking we have an emergency fund and I budget everything else to go straight into investments. We basically stay right at $10k in our banks savings account and $500 in our checking account after bills. EDIT: Most of the time there is more than $500 in our checkings but once I pay our CC each month I then move anything extra. We always use the CC so its not like we only have $500 to spend. Our CC limit is $25,000.\\n\\nA few months ago we had dinner with her friends and they talked buying a new car. My wife said something like, 'I wish I could get a new car but I'm always broke after paying the bills. We still have our college cars!' (EDIT: Wife does not want a new car). She will go on to talk about if she had money what she would want to buy and it always makes me feel ashamed. This 'I'm broke story' has been happening for years. When we were driving home I asked her about. She understood we have the money but its how she feels because her bank account is always low. I said I can increase our budget or keep more money in our bank if she wants. Since we are doing well I'm okay with spending more. She said no and again was happy with our finances. I explained that when she says we are broke it makes me look bad and I feel ashamed. Its as though I can't provide for the family and\\/or I am bad with money. She doesn't see it that way. \\n\\nThe same conversation has come up numerous times about us being broke. Recently, I reminded her numerous tikes it makes me feel and look bad infront of friends and family. I told her if she keeps saying stuff like that I will reveal that we are doing well with money. I gave her a few reminders I'd eventually do this but she kept going with the I'm broke story.\\n\\nAt a dinner with her sister and parents the same I'm broke story came up. I piped in and said, 'It's weird to hear a millionaire say they are broke.' My wife said, 'Haha, I'm not though.' And I quickly say, 'We are millionaires and you know that. We go over our finances every month.' Well the I'm broke story stopped after that and the night went on as usual. A little later the same thing happens with her friends and I use the same line. \\n\\nNow my wife is mad at me for using that line and revealing roughly how much money we have. She said it seems like I'm gloating. I say its better than making me look like I'm running us into the ground fincially. So AITA for revealing our networth when my wife says we are broke?\\n\\nEDIT: Final update for now as we have a long weekend planned. Some key points I saw a lot of and wanted to give answers.\\n\\n-I'm pretty open to us spending money and I don't restrict her spending. She has the CC to spend money monthly. Most of the month we have far more than $500 in our checking but I move anything above to our investments once I pay the CC every month. I know I won't have any big expenses then. If I do we have the CC limit and the $10k emergency cash.\\n\\n-We live on a really cheap area and had a low cost of living. We never felt rhe need to upgrade ungrade until we wanted to start having kids. I didn't have to change our lifestyle much to save a lot. \\n\\n-My job is in demand and pays well because nobody wants to live out in my area. So after expenses I take home a lot more than I would living in a major city. Probably 3 to 4 times more net savings annually if I had to guess.\\n\\n-She doesn't want a new car and has told me that multiple times. She doesn't like driving and feels comfortable with her current car. \\n\\n-She doesn't know what she wants to do when she retires. I know I'll be golfing, games, and eating edibles most days. I don't do any of this much now because we have kids and they will be my focus for a long time. I maybe golf 1 or 2 times a month amd thats the only times I take edibles.\\n\\n-I'll speak more with my wife about this. After reading posts I think she may not feel like its her money since she never saved much before we got engaged.\"},{\"index\":602,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I gave birth to my son 10 weeks ago.

But I don't really look a lot like the rest of my family (I'm the only redhead, among other things) and I did ask questions of a 'why am I the only one with -insert trait here-?' nature growing up. When I was 17 my mom took me out for ice cream and introduced me to my bio-father. She said that she felt I was old enough to know the truth, and explained about her affair, while also A) making me promise I wouldn't tell my older sister (27F in the present)  and B) hammering home along with my bio-father that he'd never be part of my life and didn't want me.\\n\\nIt was a lot, I won't lie, but I learned to suck it up and move on with my life. Fast forward to the present. My big sis has always gravitated towards older men (we like to joke that it's the result of too many George Clooney movies growing up) and two months ago shared a picture of herself and her new boyfriend. Who, to my shock, turned out to be my bio-father. I debated what to do for a couple of days, then ultimately decided she needed the truth and told her. My sister did not take it well and dumped him, but she wasn't angry with me. Honestly by now she's kinda amused, says that since she banged my dad she's my mom and has extra power to boss me around now.\\n\\nMy mom on the other hand, is *furious*. She says I divulged something that wasn't my secret to share, and that I had no business telling anyone. That since bio-father isn't related to my sister it didn't matter if he dated my sister and it wasn't like they were talking marriage anyway. It's been two month and she's still angry, still snide, calls me a traitor and finds excuses to make loud comments about how I can't be trusted with anything private or important so beware.\\n\\nAt the time I thought I was doing the right thing, but I've never seen my mom this angry before, and she's sustained that anger for 2 solid months, so I'm starting to worry.

I just don\\u2019t feel now is the right time for a Switch.\\n\\nThe theft: \\n\\nOn Easter, we (my husband, our kids, &amp; myself) are at my husband\\u2019s aunt &amp; uncle\\u2019s house. Aunt &amp; Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we\\u2019ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment &amp; has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn\\u2019t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy &amp; was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down &amp; moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.\\n\\nWell..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.\\n\\nMy kid decided to be an epic turd &amp; took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt &amp; Uncle\\u2019s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, &amp; stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt &amp; Uncle called &amp; asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.\\n\\nDue to Cousin\\u2019s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It\\u2019s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, &amp; she worked hard to have it.\\n\\nI\\u2019m disappointed about the thievery, but I\\u2019m even more upset over my kid\\u2019s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth &amp; tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn\\u2019t until I sat there &amp; thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle &amp; Cousin came by to get the gameboy, &amp; had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. \\n\\nI feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter\\u2019s help from money she would \\u201cearn\\u201d by doing extra chores) &amp; having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.\\n\\nI mentioned this to a friend &amp; they said this would be a dick move because...

For 5 of those years I was in the military and I developed the habit of being early for everything  I do. It is a huge pet peeve of mine if people are late for things when they could have been on time. If something happens out of your control and you are late then I totally understand. \\n\\nMy wife is the type of person who is always late. Throughout our relationship she has made us late for events and it has been embarrassing. One of the worst incidents was when I was home on leave. We were planning on meeting my mom for breakfast ( I haven\\u2019t seen in two years) at 9:00am. I told my wife the day before that I want to leave our place at 8:30 so we can get there by 8:50. We both wake up at 7:00 and I\\u2019m ready by 8:00. At that point she hasn\\u2019t even started to get ready.

Long story short we were a hour late and we lost our reservation because of it. \\n\\nI was pissed but kept it to myself until we got home. I told her that I hated that she always made us late and it can be embarrassing sometimes. She apologized and said she would work on it. It never got any better. If anything she would get short with me if I mention the time. \\n\\nFast forward 3 years and I was graduating the police academy. The graduation was set to begin at 10:00am and people could start showing up at 9:15. Well... knowing my wife and not wanting her to be walking in as the ceremony was beginning, I told her that the graduation started at 9:15 and she needed to be there at 8:30 to find parking.\\n\\nWell sure enough I see her driving in AT 9:15!!! Of course I was a little pissed but glad that my plan worked. The rest of the graduation went as planned and I was happy. \\n\\nAfterwards a group of us and our spouses went out to celebrate. At one point my wife mentions that she was lucky that the ceremony got pushed back or she was going to be late. My friends were confused and told her that they saw her car and that she showed up right on time. My wife then asked what time was the ceremony supposed to start? They all said 10:00am.

This is an official job; I have a work permit and receive consistent pay for teaching these lessons. I teach swim lessons for the team twice a week. The lessons are scheduled to start 10 minutes after my practice gets done, so if I am coaching, I typically get out of practice about 5-10 minutes early so I can shower and change (these are older kids so I don't have to be in the water with them). My supervisor likes us to be a few minutes early, and I also like to look presentable at least and be a good role model to the younger kids. \\n\\nThe other day, my current coach (30-ish M) wasn't able to make our practice, which doesn't happen very often. Instead of cancelling practice, another one of the coaches (50-ish F) took his place. We all knew this coach very well and I personally had her as a coach for three and a half years. She had a lot of experience and was constantly going to conventions to learn how to coach her swimmers better. \\n\\nMy typical coach is very aware that I leave early on these days as it has been going on for several weeks. When I saw we had the other coach for the day, I immediately went up to her and told her I would be getting out early. She replied by saying 10 minutes was plenty of time; I tried to explain that the job *started* in ten minutes and I needed to be there early, but she insisted that 10 minutes was enough.\\n\\nAt this point in my life, saving up for a car, I prioritized my job over athletics, and decided I would be leaving when I needed to no matter what she said. About ten minutes early, I got out of the pool and put my equipment away. The substitute coach stopped me and told me to get back in the pool and finish the current set (which would be ending a few minutes after practice should end, actually). I repeated myself, telling her that I had to leave to get ready for work, but she told me again to put my cap back on. \\n\\nI then proceeded to tell her how I admired her as a coach; she was always learning new coaching techniques, and she had so much experience and knowledge, but I needed to leave. I calmly stated that my job isn't optional, and that my supervisor expected me to be there early. Even after all this, she was still upset and told me to get back in the pool. I firmly said that I was not asking for permission, I was *telling* her I was leaving, and then walked out. She was gone by the time I returned to the pool deck to begin work.\\n\\nI have never stood up to an adult like that, and I'm wondering if I made the right decision.

Once again this doesn't bother me, but it's meant massive life changes for the kid. \\n\\nFirstly, they sent her to a private school. I can't afford anywhere near those fees, so I had to transfer her to a local school. She was upset at this at first, but she quickly made friends and is excelling academically so this isn't a huge problem. She's been off school for the last few months anyway due to the situation.\\n\\nA bigger problem is clothing. Like my sister Amy loves fashion and designer stuff. She's still got a lot of stuff that her parents got her, but she's always on the lookout for new clothes. Unfortunately, I can't afford anywhere near the sort of stuff she likes, and I also have two children of my own whose clothing I have to pay for.

She bullies her, calls her stupid and ugly, tells her none of her friends really like her etc. She has made her cry on many occasions and and often continues to taunt Hannah while she cries. \\n\\nYesterday I caught Amy trying to buy a dress costing over a thousand with my card. I was fuming and had a long conversation with her. She cried, and sobbed that she just wanted one nice thing. \\n\\nMy sister called from the prison, and Amy cried over the phone that she hates here and I treat her unfairly. I spoke to my sister afterwards and she begged me to go easy on her daughter because she's \\\"still adjusting\\\". \\n\\nI put food on this kid's plate. I buy her whatever clothes I can afford, even if they aren't to her taste.

I get that the kid is going through a tough time, and I'm doing everything I can to be there for her.

Only in a small capacity.\\n\\nMy sister who is younger than me called earlier and asked what me and my husband were doing for Thanksgiving.  I told her that it was just us and that we were just going to have a nice dinner and probably watch TV for the night. And go to bed early. She told me that she was having dinner and that we need to show up.  I told her thank you but this was the first set of holidays in ten years that I didn't have to host and I was planning on staying home and just putting on a fresh pair of pajamas after a shower and not going anywhere. She then asked about Christmas and I told her the same thing.  She then asked when it would be a good time to get together.  I told her point blank that I wasn't all that interested given our history and that I was perfectly happy with how things were at this point.\\n\\nThis was when she got pissed off and started to yell at me saying that I need to start acting more a part of the family and that I need to let go of the past.  She told me that we as \\\"Family\\\" need to try and bridge the gap and move forward in a positive way.\\n\\nI told her no we don't.  We hardly know each other.  We are very much strangers.  I also told her she needs to stop throwing the word family around like it is supposed to mean something to me.  When we started to talk again when I was 35 when our dad died her and my brother constantly berated me and told me that I need to just let them deal with everything that needed to be done.  I never disagreed with them. I told them them that they could handle it.  I was berated when our mother was sick for not visiting her in the hospital or when she was home.  I really don't have much of a relationship with my mom and she is a pretty good stranger as well so it didn't really matter. I threw everything back in her face.\\n\\nBefore we hung up she reminded me that it wasn't my husbands blood that runs through my body.  And blood is thicker than water.  I told her no.  My husbands blood did not in fact run through my body. But his semen did and that was close enough.

I hope that you are all having a great day.  First I wanted to say Thank you for all the responses, awards and everything else in between.  This has been completely insane.  I never thought this would go so far. I have tried to read every single response but there are so many that it will take hours to get through them all.  \\n\\nI wanted to do this edit to fill in some blanks so to speak. When I was kicked out I was 15 and my sister was 8.  So she did not have anything to do with what happen.  But she had every opportunity to find me after a certain point.  When she was 16 and had her own car she could have come find me.  When she was 18 and on her own she could have come to find me.  She never did.  When our dad died it was a friend of mine who talked me into going so that I could maybe find some kind of peace with what happen all those years ago.  She and another friend went with.  My husband (boyfriend at the the time) had to work and couldn't get the time off.  Initially I was greeted with surprise and thank you for coming.  But then with hostility from my sister and brother.  If they for a minute thought I was out to get something from them or our dads estate they were wrong.  I wanted nothing. And to this day I still don't. \\n\\n My siblings have always told me what my place in the family is.  Which is basically I'm window dressing. I have been told that I have no business in knowing anything about the family finances, family affairs or anything. I think that they are afraid that I could potentially take something that they want or are supposed to get.   A couple of weeks ago my mom asked me to read over some financial paperwork that she didn't understand. Reluctantly I agreed but once my sister found out she screamed at me for putting my nose into areas that I don't belong. I told my mom not to ask me for anything again because I will not be involved.  \\n\\nI have been asked a few times why I do keep in contact with them.  The answer is because it's my way of keeping ahead of them.  I do not voluntarily make contact with them.  I have no reason to.  I keep my Facebook locked down to the point that I don't show my city, my job, my phone number nothing.  But I can see all of their stuff.  This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.  Plus it does give an open avenue for communication  in the even of  a major emergency.  Plus maybe I still hold onto a hope that they will maybe at some time they will actually apologize.  But I don't see that ever being the case. \\n\\nI have been asked if my mom has ever apologized.  No she has not.  And she never will. She is from a generation where parents don't apologize to their kids.  Because that would mean they did something wrong. She is from a generation where kids were to be seen and not heard.\\n\\nI guess it comes down to this.  My family has formed this dynamic that I will never be apart of or want to be apart of.  And I'm okay with that.  I was not asked to come to Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I was told that I will be there. Why??? I don't know.

We've been together for about 10 months and he has recently started asking to move in with me. \\n\\nMy initial reaction was happiness, I was excited to spend more time with him but as he's been staying with me more(3-4 nights per week) there's a few things that have been bothering me. \\n\\n1. My bf tends to just drop stuff and not pick it up, I have a small condo so piles of clothes and stuff tend to be quite noticeable when there's basically only a handful of surfaces. I have asked him to pick stuff up and he just shrugs it off. \\n\\n2. He stays up late gaming and refuses to wear headphones so it keeps me up at night(once again its a small condo so hard to get away from noise). He works from 12pm-9pm(4 days a week) so feels like he should be able to enjoy his evenings, but i work from 6am-4pm(5 days a week) and I drive heavy machinery so its important I get enough sleep and im alert enough for work.\\n\\n3. He recently was telling me about how much he was going to save by not paying rent(he currently pays $210\\/wk), and I questioned why he thought he would be living rent free with me, he argued that he shouldn't have to contribute to my mortgage, and I agreed but said that I would still want about 50% of market rent(market rent is around $220 and i said i would like $100\\/week, my mortgage payments are $340\\/week so its not like he's paying half my mortgage). This turned into a rather large argument and he repeatedly slammed doors in my condo and damaged the lock on one. He then got mad when I asked him to help fix it.\\n\\n4. He has repeatedly suggested that if he moved in then my cat would have to be confined to the hall cupboard when he's here because he doesn't like cats(he's not allergic, he just doesn't like them). I disagree and think that's unfair to my 11yo cat who has had the run of the place for the last 4 years.\\n\\nLong story short, my bfs current rental period is up end of July and he has repeatedly talked about moving here rather than finding somewhere else, ive consistently rebutted this but finally put my foot down last weekend after he deliberately let my cat outside and said he absolutely wouldn't be moving in with me and I wanted him to move his gaming stuff out if my lounge\\/kitchen area. He threw a massive fit and stormed off and now his mum is ringing me and calling me a lot of rather rude things because he's going to have to move back in with them until he finds a new place. AITA for mot letting him move in, even though I was initially keen?\\n\\n\\nQuite a few people have asked our ages, im 24, he's 29.\"},{\"index\":574,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"This is a throwaway because my friends have Reddit and I don't want them to find this.\\n\\nI have a housemate (Jilian 26f) who is severely allergic to peanuts. There are 5 of us who rent a house together and we all agreed to put a label in our food containers to help keep Jilian safe and avoid contamination. I have a mini fridge in my room where I store my drinks so that I don't have to go to the kitchen if I want a drink in the middle of the night.\\n\\nWell last Friday my Filipino girlfriend gave me an authentic Filipino dish for lunch at work. It's called kare-kare, it's an ox tail stew with a rich peanut sauce. It's in a glass container, and I saved some so I  can have it for dinner.\\n\\nWhen I got home I put it in my mini fridge but I forgot to eat it that night because we ordered pizza for dinner. Saturday I went out with my girlfriend and got home at around 9pm. When I arrived Jilian's girlfriend (Trish) confronted me saying I almost killed Jilian. I didn't know what she was talking about, she went on saying how irresponsible of me to not label the food in my mini fridge. I asked one of our housemates wtf happened and he said Jilian had an allergic reaction to my stew because I didn't put a label on the container. I told them it's inside my personal mini fridge and how dare they enter my room. Trish said they were looking for beer when they saw my stew. She and another housemate ate it, Jilian only tasted it and she had an anaphylactic shock where they had to use her EpiPen to stop the swelling.\\n\\nTrish then demanded that I need to pay for the EpiPen. I told them that is not going to happen. If anything they should apologize to me for trespassing and stealing my food. They called me an asshole. She and 3 housemates said I nearly caused Jilian her life and the least I could do is apologize and pay for the EpiPen. AITA?\\n\\nEdit for more info: Jilian was taken to the hospital. No, I never gave anyone any permission to enter my room. They were drinking that time and were looking for more beer. They ate the dish with some rice that they found on top of the mini fridge. I think Jilian ate some rice that had sauce on it. I didn't get to ask the details of that exactly happened.\\n\\nEdit\\/update: So I visited Jilian in the hospital today and she apologized to me for what happened. It was an accident. She said she didn't eat my kare-kare but took some rice. She didn't realize that some sauce got on the rice bowl, so there was clearly a cross contamination. It wasn't her who went in my room, it was Trish and another housemate, Ian. I will be charging them for the stolen beer and food.\\n\\nI will definitely buy a lock after this incident. Thank you all for your advice, judgement and awards!\"},{\"index\":575,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"Yes, I know the title sounds awful, but please do hear me out before making a judgement. I will accept whatever judgement I\\u2019m given.\\n\\nI (30m) purchased a 3 bedroom condo in Toronto, Canada 5 years ago when I was in my second year of medical residency. Soon after the purchase, I rented one of the rooms to my roommate (f29) to offset the costs of the mortgage. I live in one room, she lives in the second, and the third is my study\\/office. She has been a great roommate from the beginning. We aren\\u2019t necessarily friends (as in we don\\u2019t do things together for fun), but we get along exceptionally well.\\n\\nThe entire roommate\\/tenant relationship has gone swimmingly up until recently. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate broke the news to me that she is pregnant. The father was a fling of hers, who does not want anything to do with the child. My roommate has decided she wants to keep the child anyways, and raise it on her own. To me that seems like a huge challenge, and I admire her for it.\\n\\nThe issue is, while I don\\u2019t necessarily dislike children, I have no desire to live with a baby. While the condo is a fair size, I will most definitely be woken up by the babies crying at night. My condo is also where I like to come home to and relax, like a haven after a long work day, and the idea of coming home to a baby honestly seems absolutely chaotic. Especially since this isn\\u2019t my own child (ie one that my girlfriend and I decided to have\\/was mentally prepared for).\\n\\nAs difficult as it was for me to do this, I told my her essentially what I\\u2019ve written here, and that it would be best if she finds somewhere else to live. I am not rushing her out or anything like that, I have given her 6 month\\u2019s notice, since any later than that will come too close to the birth. She was honestly quite taken aback by this, and thought that I was being cruel. Her primary concern is that rent has gone up substantially in this city since she signed on with me (I haven\\u2019t increased her rent since she moved in, so she\\u2019s essentially paying 2015 rent). She works as a waitress, and will likely need to find a lesser apartment to keep within the same budget. A couple of other considerations are that she was out of work while restaurants were closed, but I did waive her rent for that period. All of the furniture is also mine (aside from her bedroom), so she would need to figure something out on that front as well, aside from all of the child expenses. I understand her position, and I feel horrible about the situation, but I honestly can\\u2019t do it. AITA for this?\\n\\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who has commented. There have been two great suggestions on how I can make this situation better, which I have taken to heart. I haven't been able to give life much thought lately, as work has been quite busy. Firstly, I have a friend in real estate, and I'm going to see if they can help her try to find some affordable listings. Secondly - as I don't plan to take on another tenant after her, and can afford to do this anyway - I have decided I'm going to waive her rent for the remainder of the tenancy. This will hopefully give her a bit of a boost to get on her feet.\\n\\nEdit 2: I'm just checking on this for the first time today. My god, I was not expecting anywhere near this many replies. Thank you to everyone who has commented. I am about to head into surgery, but I will do my best to get back to as many people as I can later today.\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nEdit 3\\/update:  I am honestly overwhelmed by the amount of attention this has gotten. Thank you everyone that commented, regardless of your opinion. I was planning to reply to as many posts as possible, but honestly seeing as there are over 2000 comments, I think I will have to just address some common questions here. I also have an update on the situation, and I wish everyone that's commented so far could receive notification to read it.\\n\\nSo firstly: To anyone asking about the legality of the matter, I consulted an attorney to be 1000% sure, and this is perfectly legal. Since I live in the unit, the eviction laws are much more lenient.\\n\\nSecondly: To anyone that said I should allow her to live with me anyway, I challenge you to consider what the alternative would be. If this doesn't happen now, then when? Her baby will become a toddler, and a toddler eventually becomes a school age child. Will it really be any better to do this later on? Or do you suggest that I let her raise the child here until they are 18?\\n\\n**Finally, the update:** When I came home from work today, I told her that I wanted to discuss the overall situation. Before I even began, she actually apologized to me for how she spoke to me, and for expecting that I would be okay for her to raise her child here. I told her that her apology is totally unnecessary, as her reaction was completely understandable considering the uncertainty of her future. I then told her that what I told all of you; that I would waive her rent for the remainder of her stay to help her get on her feet. She pushed back on this at first, but after I urged her to think of her child, she graciously accepted. Aside from this, I also told her about my friend who could help her out with finding some affordable listings in the area. I thought I might be overstepping there, but she was actually extremely thankful and said she would take me up on there.\\n\\nFinally, I want to thank u\\/tuttipeachyfrutti for probably the best piece of advice that I've read (I'm sure there are many more people that I should be thanking, but I honestly don't think I'll be able to read everything here). This was that I could help her obtain a more reliable work position at my hospital, nothing fancy as she doesn't have any schooling, but it will be much more secure than waitressing (and once you're in, there's always ways to work your way up). There would also be benefits\\/maternity leave that I don't think restaurants usually offer. This was probably my biggest risk of overstepping, but when I mentioned the idea to her she was actually over the moon (tears were shed...). I do agree that I acted in self interest here, so I think it's the least I can do to make sure this soon to be mother and her child have some sense of security in their lives. Thank you again to everyone.\\n\\n**\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*This isn't an edit, but more of a request. Does anyone here know if it's possible to change your title to include something like \\\"updated\\\".

She watches my kids 3 days a week, and I watch hers 3 days a week. This agreement has stood since March 2020 without issues. Any changes have been discussed weeks in advance.\\n\\nA couple weeks ago, we had an argument. The next day, I brought my kids to her house, dropped them off, and left. I didn't speak to my sister in law, because when one of us is in a rush, like I was, it's standard for us to just let the kids out, stay in the car, and drive off when you see the door open.\\n\\nI drove to work, about 40 minutes away. When I got there, I had about 20 missed calls, and even more texts, all from my sister in law, all saying she didn't want to watch the kids given our argument. Her first text arrived a little before I got to her place, but I didn't see it until I got to work because my phone is always on silent when I drive. I rang her, said I'll arrange to work from home, then come get the kids. She said I have 45 mins to get back to her place or she would call the police.\\n\\nI told my supervisor the situation, and she said I could leave after I did a few things. This delayed me 20 mins. When I got back to my sister in law's, just over an hour later, she said she'd already called the police when the 45 mins ran out. I then had to stick around long enough to tell the officer that I didn't abandon my children, there was just a communication issue.\\n\\nSister in law and I had another shouting match later over this. I arranged other childcare for my kids and I've been mostly ignoring her since. However, she reached out and apologised, and has asked if I'd be willing to go back to the old childcare arrangement. I've told her to go fuck herself.\\n\\nI work with kids. If I got child abandonment on my record, I would never work in my field again, which she knew, and her calling the police was a *massive* overreaction, so if she needs a babysitter she can go whistle for all I care. She said that if I checked my phone, talked to her that morning, or came back when I was supposed to, she would not have needed to call the police, and I did this to myself, as she gave me a warning with that first text and I could have checked my phone or spoken to her directly when I got to her place, all of which she says she would have done if she were in my position, given that we'd argued the night before. I've told her that if she thinks I'm babysitting for her, she's fucking delusional, and she's on her own.\\n\\nBecause of my refusal, it's looking like she may have to quit her job because my brother and her would pay more for a babysitter than they would earn from her working. My mother and brother have both called me an arsehole because there were no consequences to her calling the police, and that while she overreacted, she's apologised, so if I really forgive her, I'll let us move on. This income loss would also mean that she, my brother, and my niece and nephew might need to move somewhere cheaper, that my brother might have to take on extra hours at work, and in an extreme scenario they may even be completely unable to live independently, meaning they'd have to move in with her parents, who live several hours away.\\n\\nAITA?\"},{\"index\":580,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I'm (28M) my brothers care taker (21M mental age 7-8), our parents decided at 18 to tell us to screw off, so when my brother (let's call him Bill) turned 18 I grabbed him and enrolled him to get his GED since he didn't finish highschool, and take care of him.

We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. \\n\\n\\nI went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. \\n\\n\\nIt came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. \\n\\n\\nAs I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says \\\"Dear, will you sit down for just another moment.\\\" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. \\\"With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,\\\". I looked at her like \\\"what the fuck\\\" and she continued \\\"well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,\\\". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say \\\"you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,\\\".\\n\\nI was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don\\u2019t want to go after anybody\\u2019s job, but I don\\u2019t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. \\n\\nWill I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?\\n\\nEdit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said \\u201cI appreciate your openness and honesty tho\\u201d (like that mattered after anything she just said \\ud83d\\ude29) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said \\u201cthanks\\u201d and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn\\u2019t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. \\n\\nAlso, she was a nurse practitioner.

That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. \\n\\n2) for ever man calling me a slut: you\\u2019re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so \\u201cclosing my legs\\u201d or \\u201cquit being easy\\u201d doesn\\u2019t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single \\u201cwhore\\u201d had one thing in common and that\\u2019s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! \\n\\n3) For teenage girls\\/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody\\u2019s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. \\n\\nNow to the update: \\nI called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn\\u2019t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. \\n\\nI explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she\\u2019s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. \\n\\nI then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn\\u2019t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. \\n\\nThe lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she\\u2019d \\u201ccall the doctor (her supervisor)\\u201d right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn\\u2019t be back in the office until next Monday. \\n\\nWith all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You\\u2019ve truly been so helpful. \\n\\nAnd for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn\\u2019t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.\"},{\"index\":582,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"A story as old as time.

I have a 14 year old daughter from my previous marriage. My late wife passed away in 2014. She left a few things for our daughter. Including a gold jewelry set. Her mom was devastated she didn't get to gift the set to our daughter on her wedding day. I keep it in my closet since it's expensive and my daughter is too young to have it. I'll hopefully gift it to her on her wedding.\\n\\nLast week. We were sitting in the kitchen when my stepson was hesitant to ask me something. We're in good terms but have our fair share of arguments. He said his fianc\\u00e8e was taking something from his mother's and my closet. saw the jewellery set and liked it very much. He asked if he could borrow it so his fianc\\u00e8e can wear it at her cousin's wedding. I found this unacceptable I told him his fianc\\u00e8e had no business being in the bedroom and that the jewellery isn't mine. It's for my daughter. He asked me if my daughter will agree to let him borrow it if he talked to her. I told him not to even talk about it again. He got all pissed and said things I do not remember.\\n\\nSaturday night. When he and his fianc\\u00e8e were at the wedding. I discovered that the jewellery set was gone. I told my wife and we looked all over the house. I called my stepson to tell him about calling the police because I really thought someone stole the set. He said there was no need. That he borrowed it and will return it after they get back from the wedding. I yelled at him and told him to come back with it right then. I kept calling him til 12am when he told me to stop calling and that he'd bring it in the morning.\\n\\nI couldn't sleep that night I felt terrible. In the morning he showed up at 10am. He didn't bring it and started stalling saying: \\\"he forgot\\\"- \\\"he'd bring it the next day\\\". At this point it was clear he gifted it to his fianc\\u00e8e and was stalling. I got so mad I told him I will be pressing charges if he doesn't return the set today. We got into an argument\\nMy wife said his fiancee was the one who wanted the jewelry set. But he was the one who took it and it's not even mine it's my daughter's which made it worse. Because I'm responsible for whatever happens to it.\\n\\nHis grandparents berated me after I told them this and got mad and defended him when I said that I will be pressing charges. he stole and needed to be responsible for his actions He didn't respond to my final calls so now I've given him one last chance and it's over\\n\\nI pressed charges today. They're saying calling the police was extreme and cruel. They're all convincing me to back down.\\n\\nAita for pressing charges?\\n\\nHe was replying to me sarcastically when I said I'd get the authorities involved and he didn't take me seriously. His mom said she'd try to talk to him but I had enough of him stalling hoping I'll just let it go. So he can make his fianc\\u00e8e happy.\\n\\nI feel like an irresponsible idiot. I can't even look at my daughter without feeling frustrated and infuriated. I'm hurt but what's worse is that this is my daughter's property that I couldn't take care of.\\nMy wife allows them into the room although I told her not to several times they're not kids and there should be some boundaries.\\n\\nI just needed to mention that We're in Europe.\"},{\"index\":589,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"THROW AWAY for obvious reasons. \\n\\nUPDATE - in comments :)  and cat tax is \\nhttp:\\/\\/imgur.com\\/gallery\\/HJtx6Jh\\n\\nBackground. I (30f) lived with a longtime friend (30m). We lived together for 6 years and known each other for 20 years (close families)  He was very accepting that I came with a cat, I paid for everything and legally owned her. He adored her though and would spend hours cuddling her.  I owned everything, all the furniture and the white goods because I had lived out of home before but he had not.\\n\\nHe got a GF at the 3.5 year mark and she practically moved in immediately. I still paid half the rent though. She was always very rude to me and clearly didn't want me alone with my friend.  There was only one lounge, attached to the kitchen, so he and I would previously watch TV together or just be in the same room while another cooked, worked etc. When she moved in that 'had to stop' because I was interfering with their couple time. Her attitude towards me got worse over time and my friend started treating me badly. They would leave sex toys all over the place, watch movies late and loud when my  bedroom was right there, glare at me if I cooked during their couple time even though they hogged the TV between 4-9pm.\\n\\nI got a bf and started spending a lot of time with him.  After this things got worse.  My friend began locking my cat in small cages and putting her the shower. He also began talking differently to me and leave the kitchen in a absolute mess (mould) to make it difficult for me to cook. I found used condoms in the lounge.  It then got to the stage where we wouldn't talk but all the tormenting was still going on.\\n\\nI decided to leave and started looking for somewhere else.  The lease was up in 4 months but we had not discussed what we wanted to do. I found out through his sister (and a close friend of mine) that they had been saving up this whole time to move out and would be moving in a few weeks'. This was news to me. I couldn't afford the rent by myself.\\n\\nI found a place before they did, spoke to the estate agent and advised them of the situation - turns out he had not been paying his full share of the rent and she was not listed as living there. The agent did not hold me accountable for any of it.  I paid 4 weeks' leave before I left. I didn't tell them when I was leaving and on a day when they were not home my friends helped me pack up and leave.  The house was cleaned spotless.  I also took all of my furniture, whitegoods and kitchenware - so basically everything but his room! I took my cat.\\n\\nAfter I left I received hundreds of missed calls and messages from them abusing me for not notifying them and taking everything and MY cat. Most of his family also messaged me telling me what an AH I am. My parents knew what I was doing, supported me but have also called me an AH because our families are still not exactly on speaking terms.\"},{\"index\":590,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My stepsister impersonated me and cancelled my wedding venue reservation.

It's close to the gym, to the grocery store, to pretty much everything.

But he wasn't happy with any of them. I got him a perfume and he liked it.\\n\\nWe were visiting my family and we had dinner with them. My fianc\\u00e8 looked at the Xbox I got for my brother and didn't stop talking about it. My parents noticed, I told him to stop complaining about what he got\\/didn't get this year.

I was so mad I told him this wasn't for him and he basically took something that is not his. Not to mention a pen for an Xbox, that's ridiculous.\\nHe told me that maybe I shouldn't have spent 300 while trying to pay for rent. I told him as long as I can pay rent that's not a problem. And that he needs to find a job if he thinks my money isn't enough. I called my mom and I found out that they didn't actually exchange gifts. My fianc\\u00e8 pressured my brother into giving him his Xbox. I was livid and so mad I told him to take the Xbox back to my brother but he said it was between him and my brother but I insisted.

We went through with consultations and while we had very promising results for treatment the cost did give us pause. It wasn't that we couldn't afford it we just weren't at the point yet where we were willing to pay. I discussed it with my husband and we were both fine with the idea of adopting. \\n\\nMy cousin Tiffany (25f) is adopted and she supported our choice in looking into it. However this was a couple of years back and during that time Tiffany was reunited with her birth parents and she's been acting pretty hurtful to my aunt and uncle since then. She keeps making post about how happy she is to know where she comes from and is happy about being reunited with her \\\"real family.\\\" She even talked about having her birth father walk her down the aisle as a chance to make up for lost time. Obviously my uncle was very hurt about this but went he voiced it Tiffany got defensive. She called my uncle selfish, how this was about her and that he knew what he signed up for when raising someone else's kid.\\n\\nBefore the pandemic Tiffany moved closer to where her bio mother lived so they could make up for lost time, and Tiffany kept making post after post about all the fun she was having meeting relatives, and how she called\\/video chatted with each of her bio parents multiple times a week meanwhile she barely texted back my uncle and aunt once a month. I could tell how heartbroken my aunt and uncle were but tried to give Tiffany her space and the few times they said anything she accuse them of being selfish and unsupportive. I think the biggest thing that broke them was when Tiffany promised to come by for my aunt's birthday (COVID restrictions were lifted) and was even given the money to travel to them but then never showed up. She called literally the day before to say that her bio mom had an emergency so she wasn't going to make it, but didn't give back the money. \\n\\nI am completely disgusted by Tiffany's behavior and while I haven't completely ruled out adoption entirely I did want to give medical assisted conception a try. My husband supported this and we are now currently expecting. After we made our announcement Tiffany messaged me asking why I would spend thousands on creating a child when I could helped one who already existed. I tried to play it off but Tiffany kept pressing and calling me a bad person when there are so many children who desperately need a home and overpopulation. It got to the point where she was pissing me off and I just came clean and said that her behavior towards the people who loved and raised her was the reason.

I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.\\n\\nFor an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.\\n\\nA few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.\\n\\nSo last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords\\/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.\\n\\nHe doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring\\/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).\\n\\nI've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.\\n\\n\\nEdit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.

The usual stuff you ask new neighbours but then she asked me when I planned on moving which I thought was quite unusual. I told her I had no plans to move yet and then she went on to talk about how young people have started moving into the street and it is much so noisy, especially those with families (She knew I have kids but they barely spend any time outside) and how she wished it went back to a street of old people.\\n\\nFor about 10 minutes there was nothing but low key insults about young people.

He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.\\n\\nThere was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.\\n\\nYou really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can't go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son.

They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can't go into much detail, but he said he'd do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that's fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.\\n\\nThe rest of the family, for the most part, weren't happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious.

She makes them for the holidays and family gatherings and people always request that she brings them. I asked for the recipe once and she laughed and said no - that it was \\\"hers\\\" and she doesn't give it out to anyone. I dropped it and never asked again.\\n\\nI started baking a LOT during the pandemic. It's been fun for me in my downtime. I decided with my free time to try to recreate the cookie bars my boyfriend's mom makes. I pulled up recipes that sounded similar from online blogs and started baking and tweaking. It took about 5 recipes and batches but I finally nailed it down (her secret recipe ended up essentially being a cookie bar known as a Carmelita).\\n\\nI then decided to make it \\\"my own\\\" and improve it to my tastes. I used higher quality chocolate, made sauce with local homemade caramels, used flakey sea salt on top, vanilla bean paste instead of extract, added a pinch of this fantastic organic cinnamon I had on hand. The results were over the top delicious. My boyfriend declared they are better than his mom's and he finished off half a pan in 2 days.\\n\\nHe was Facetiming with his mom Saturday and eating one. She asked what it was and he said \\\"One of your caramel bars. Jo found a recipe online but made it even better.\\\" SHE LOST IT. She started yelling about how awful I was for making \\\"her\\\" cookies and how I had no right. He told her that she was overreacting and quickly ended the call.\\n\\nShe started blowing up my phone with nasty texts about what an asshole I am. I explained to her that I found the recipe I used online where it was very public, I had actually tweaked that to make it more my own, and that I wasn't ever planning on bringing them to an event she's at so I did not see what the big deal was. She didn't care. She called me names and told me I was wrong for baking a recipe that I knew was similar to hers. She isn't speaking to me or her son.\\n\\nWhile I don't think my boyfriend should have made the comment about how I \\\"made it even better\\\" to his mom...taking that out of the equation she thinks I'm an asshole for even making them to begin with. I disagree, but from the texts from her and a couple other family members of hers, they think I crossed a line. AITA for recreating this recipe?\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Edit to add this, since people are asking - and edit to correct that I make my caramel sauce WITH homemade caramels from a local shop:\\n\\nI used the recipe below for the \\\"base\\\" for my bars, but then made the tweaks I mentioned above. I used high quality chocolate, homemade caramels from a local candy place, I add 1Tbs of vanilla bean paste into my caramel when I melt it, and a pinch (probably 1\\/4 tsp. or less) of a very mild organic cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture. I top it with flakey sea salt. They are GREAT the regular way though, because the tweaks I made to my last batch (the batch that got me in trouble because they were declared better than the inspiration) add up in price quickly.\\n\\n[https:\\/\\/luluthebaker.com\\/the-tale-of-the-carmelitas\\/](https:\\/\\/luluthebaker.com\\/the-tale-of-the-carmelitas\\/)\"},{\"index\":976,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.

I live\\/work in Germany and prior to this team I only used English in writing and spoke German with everyone.\\n\\nWe had a couple of virtual meetings and I noticed some of the Americans mispronouncing my name - they called me Mr. Birch. So I corrected them, my surname is Bi\\u010d (Czech noun meaning \\u201ca whip\\u201d, happens to be pronounced just like \\u201cbitch\\u201d). My name is not English and doesn\\u2019t have English meaning. Well, turns out the Americans felt extremely awkward about calling me Mr Bitch and using first names is not a norm here. HR got in touch with me and I just stated that I don\\u2019t see a problem with my name (and I don\\u2019t feel insulted by being called \\u201cMr Bitch\\u201d), I mean, the German word for customer sounds like \\u201ccunt\\u201d in Czech, it\\u2019s just how it is.\\n\\nWell apparently the American group I\\u2019m working with is demanding a different representative (they also work from home and feel uncomfortable saying \\u201ccurse words\\u201d(my name) in front of their families), but due to the time zone issues the German office is having problems finding a replacement for me, nobody wants to work a 2am-7am office shift from home. So management approached me asking to just accept being called Mr Birch but honestly I am a bit offended. A coworker even suggested that I have grounds for discrimination complaint.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for refusing to answer to a different name?\\n\\nEdit due to common question: using first names is not our company policy due to different cultural customs, for many (me included) using first names with very distant coworkers is not comfortable and the management ruled that using surnames and titles is much more suitable for professional environment. I am aware that using first names is common in the USA, please mind that while the company is international, the US office is just one of the branches.\\n\\nEdit 2: many people are telling me to suck it up and change my name or the pronunciation, because many American immigrants did that. So I just want to remind you: I am not an immigrant. I do not live in the US nor do I intend to. I deal with 10ish Americans in video calls and a few dozen in email communication. Then I also deal with hundreds of others at my job - French, Indian, Japanese, Russian... I live in Germany and am from Czech Republic. I know this is a shock for some but really, Americans are a minority in this story.\\n\\nEdit 3: I deal with other teams as well, everyone calls me Mr Bi\\u010d, having one single team call me by my first name (which is impolite) or by changing my name is troublesome because things like Birch really do sound different. Someone mentioned Beach, which still sounds odd but it\\u2019s better than Birch. Right now I have three options as last resort, if they absolutely cannot speak my name and if German office doesn\\u2019t re-assign me: 1. use beach, 2. use Mr Representative, 3. switch to German, which is our office\\u2019s official language. Nobody has issues with Bi\\u010d when speaking German. (Yeah the last option is kind of silly, I know for a fact not everyone in the team speaks German and we would still use English in writing)\\n\\nEdit4: last edit. Dear Americans, I know you use first names in business\\/work environment. Please please please understand that the rest of the world is not America. Simply using English for convenience sake does not mean we have to follow specific American customs.\"},{\"index\":658,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I'm still angry over this and I may not write very well, and also I probably don't judge the situation very well being this angry so I came to you.\\n\\nI'm a student.

And she doesn't like my scaly boy at all so double points I guess\\n\\n\\u2022 People saying that a drawing tablet is useless, thanks for your input but the question was if I was an A for the way I reacted and my decision to not give her a gift anymore.

Their rules: No dating out unless in a group, no swearing, no girl allowed over or going to her house, no phone in the bedroom, no phone at night, no passwords, social media has to be checked by a parent, keep location on life360, curfew 9:30 pm, no whispering, if I want to watch something they have to review it first to see if it has a lot of \\u201cinappropriate\\u201d content, etc. \\n\\nLast year I got a girlfriend (18f) and we\\u2019ve been friends since we were 12. She wasn\\u2019t allowed over. If we went out on a date it\\u2019d have to be with friends. I bought condoms a couple of months after dating. My parents found them. They confiscated them and grounded me for a month. My girlfriend bought more for us because we still found our way around the rules and no teen wants to have a baby accident just because adults are naive. When I was ungrounded I got a job and bought my own phone. I figured if I showed responsibility by getting my own phone and paying the bill monthly, my parents would not treat me so childishly. \\n\\nThey got mad at me and said the same rules they had about the phone they bought me will apply to this one. Still couldn\\u2019t use it in the bedroom, had to leave it in the living room at night, still had it checked frequently, all that. The most confusing thing about parents is they know their children will be considered adults at 18, but they shelter them and are overly strict with them as they get close to that age. How will they function as adults when they have no sense of independence? Because I thought you were supposed to gradually loosen the reigns as your kid gets closer to 18, but I guess being power trips is more comforting. \\n\\nI live in NY but I applied to several colleges in Texas, Louisiana, California because I have family in those states.

I said we have tons of extended family in Houston and I\\u2019m going to be with a family member. My parents called me a selfish brat. They walked away from me while I was still trying to defend myself. We haven\\u2019t had another conversation about it since. It\\u2019s basically just silent treatment.

Mostly negative, tasteless, backhanded comments. She says she can't help it and that no one should be offended when she's just being honest.\\n\\n\\nWhen she met Kevin, she kept making comments about him, his car, his degree etc. With time and strict conversations I was able to get her to show some respect. But she kept annoying Kevin by constantly talking about his hairless face (his face is clean he doesn't have a beard or mustache which he can be very insecure about, he comes from Irish origins so he's white, he has no facial hair while I'm hispanic) mom made jokes with her husband about how \\\"unmanly\\\" it is to not be able to grow a beard or a mustache. Those comments hurt Kevin so much. I had as very very stern conversation with her and she said \\\"oh I didn't realize those remarks were offending him I was just teasing him\\\" or \\\"you know me I'm just giving my humble, honest opinion so he shouldn't take it personal and should learn that this is how I am\\\". She ended up sincerely apologizing to Kevin and we left it at that.\\n\\nAs the wedding is approaching. Mom decided to give Kevin a wedding gift and also to let him know how sorry she was for her past behavior. She invited the whole family for dinner and decided it was the perfect time to hand Kevin his wedding gift.

She told me to relax she was just messing with him but I said she knew how he felt about this topic and demanded she apologize but she said no since she wasn't responsible for his reaction and thought he was going to laugh along. I angrily said \\\" no apology, no wedding invitation, period\\\" then walked out.

No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. \\n\\nI had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope.

I'm a high school senior (18M) and promposal season is currently in full swing. \\n\\nI was in my AP chem class when suddenly an entourage of people entered my classroom with a disabled girl (she has cerebral palsy) that I know. I first saw the posters and the bouquet of flowers she was holding and thought, \\\"aww that's sweet of her.\\\" Then they revealed the posters and I read my name and was completely taken aback. I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. \\n\\nOne of my buddies asked me if I was okay afterwards since apparently I looked like I was gonna burst into tears and I told him I literally did not expect that at all and I didn't want to say yes. He suggested that I go find her after school or something and explain that to her and I agreed. Now, this girl is really  nice. We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me; usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. \\n\\nSo I ended up going to the special ed classroom after school where I found her and asked if I could speak to her outside. I told her everything and how I really, really appreciated the gesture, but I was already planning on asking my crush to prom and she was CRUSHED. She started crying really loudly and asked me why I couldn't of just said no and I said that I didn't want to embarrass the two of us in front of all those people. At this point, one of her aids came out to check on us since she could hear the crying and the girl told her aid what happened and she straight up glared at me and said, \\\"That's not okay.\\\" \\n\\nNow I feel like absolute shit.

We actually met because we were serving as treasurers for our school's College Democrats and Young Republicans clubs, respectively, and our groups would get together for drinks or bowling or laser tag once a month.  \\n\\nWell, Natalie and I bonded over a lot of shared interests and we hit it off.  Even if we didn't see eye to eye on many issues, debating her was stimulating and formed the cornerstone of our relationship.  We've had debates that went on until dawn.  We just bounced off each other.  She liked to joke that we were \\\"drift compatible\\\".  \\n\\nI wanted to marry this woman, but she passed away before we got a chance to talk about marriage.  I'm in therapy and I'm working through working through not having her in my life anymore, but it's been rough.  Then 'Rona happened and I got laid off, so I had to move back in with my parents and figure out what I am supposed to do now.\\n\\nMy parents mean well, but they got married really young and are more conservative and religious than me.  They've been trying to set me up on dates with single girls from their church since I moved back home.  But I don't want to date these girls.\\n\\nNo offense to them, but it's a small town in the American Breadbasket.  They don't share the same interests as me and it feels like their only goal in life is to be a good Christian wife and produce a lot of babies.  Trying to talk to them about current events is excruciating for me.  The girls my parents tried to set me up with take everything they read on Facebook or hear from Fox News for face value.  It makes me miss Natalie and our debates more. \\n\\nMy parents mean well.  I know they want me to find a nice girl and settle down with her, but not like this.  They are nothing like Natalie and never will be.  I miss her, even if my folks didn't like her ideas.  \\n\\nBut when I told them the other night that I wanted them to stop setting me up on dates with these girls, they freaked out and told me that I needed to consider settling down since I just turned thirty.  They're good girls from great families, I know that, and my parents like them more than they liked Natalie, but she was my one and only.  I don't think it's fair for anyone when I still love her.  \\n\\nThey are even more angry at me because I told them that I just don't see myself getting married anytime soon.

Yet, they are insisting that I need to find a woman and settle down and give them grandchildren.\\n\\nEdit:  We were seriously close to talking about marriage.

I'm no good with kids, so I remarked to her that if I ever have them, I'll train them, not babysit. She brushed me off.\\n\\nThe kids now are hella destructive and loud. Pulling out stuffing inside furniture, holes inside walls, smashing anything glass and porcelain, screaming louder than a fire alarm, you name it. When it was my first turn to deal with them, I immediately walked with them to the store and grabbed the biggest bag of M&amp;M's I could find and trained them so that every time they follow my orders and behave, they get one. If they misbehave, I get one.\\n\\nSoon enough, every time the kids were dumped on me, they went with my guidelines and behaved. Whenever I say sit, they sit at the table. When I say stay, they don't leave that spot, etc.\\n\\nTwo days ago there was a party planned with the whole extended family (I know, pandemic. Didn't want to, but mom insisted) and I grabbed the M&amp;M's since the twins were there.

I told her that I'm their aunt, not their parent, why am I the one disciplining them? Isn't that her job?\\n\\nShe screamed the same argument at me and since she's their mother, to stop giving them candy. One of the twins overheard and went apeshit.

His twin joined him soon after. \\n\\nI repeated that she's their mother, and just sat in the living room watching it all unfold. At the end, Amy blamed me for them turning out this way.

They specified these two locations to explain why I had tan skin.\\n\\nAs I was growing up certain things about my physical makeup made me more curious about my birth parents. My hair was kept short as a kid but as a teen I wanted to experiment. I grew it out and it grew out curly. Big curls but still curly. This upset my parents so they asked that I not grow it out. When I moved away for college I began to let it grow again. I met my girlfriend in school. She is Black American so she also helped me care for it. She once braided my hair before I FaceTimed my parents who lost it on me for wearing it that way. \\n\\nThroughout my time in school I still searched for my birth mom but would always come up empty. My girlfriend hinted that there must\\u2019ve been a mistake with the information, even down to the name my parents claimed I had before they adopted me. She gifted me a DNA kit on my birthday that I didn\\u2019t get around to until the lockdown hit. I didn\\u2019t think anything would come of it because my parents weren\\u2019t American so I didn\\u2019t know if it would work that way.

My parents claimed to have met my birth parents therefore they couldn\\u2019t have mistaken them for white. \\n\\nI confronted my parents who became enraged at me for doing a DNA kit. I was very angry, yelling, swearing. They robbed me of my identity and hindered my search with their lies. My mom told me through tears that my racial background comes with a stigma. That I passed so she wanted me to have an easier life fitting in. My dad yelled at me that I had to abandon what I just learned. I rage broke my phone and left. My siblings have been hitting me up on social media reprimanding me for being upset because our parents reasoning is sound. I do pass, I did have an easy life.

I was extremely insulted by this and told her I'd transfer her the money she wanted but I would be moving back to my own house (where I am also paying rent).

She cried when we we didn't get a pizza with her favorite toppings, and then stole the first slice of cake meant for my daughter. Things got worse at the movie. The first movie (Cruella) was too scary for Molly and she started freaking out and crying multiple times throughout the movie. I tried to calm her down, suggesting we take a walk to the snack bar during the scary parts or close her eyes, but she was inconsolable. I tried calling Molly's mom a few times to pick her up, but I didn't get an answer.

A few days later though, Molly's mom told me that she can't stop talking about the party and how much fun she had.\\n\\nThat evening, after all the other girls had left, my daughter was clearly upset about having her birthday ruined. I felt bad for asking her to invite Molly, so I told her the next weekend, I would take her and her friends out for pizza and to see Black Widow in the theater to make it up to her, but my partner thinks this is a real jerk move, He pointed out that sometimes life isn't fair and things get ruined.

No idea who they were expecting, but when they realized P was my girlfriend, everything just blew up.  \\n\\nApparently, they had already \\u201cdiscussed and arranged\\u201d my marriage with X years back, and she was the one I would have to marry.

He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the \\\"best unwatchable episode of TV ever\\\" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. \\n\\nSo how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the \\\"removed\\\" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. \\n\\nMy cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. \\n\\nI basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  \\n\\nThat's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of \\\"Scott's Tots\\\" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. \\n\\nNo amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). \\n\\nThere is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. \\n\\nI have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. \\n\\nWould I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?\\n\\nEdit: just for my own notes since I\\u2019m saving this thread and I guess if might help other people be clear.\\n\\nCousin A (nieces mom), 38: paid.\\n\\nCousin\\/sister  J, 32: paid.\\n\\nMe: paid \\n\\nCousin B, 25: not paid.\\n\\nCousin J2, 20: in school.\\n\\nNiece K, 18: not paid (subject of post).\\n\\nA, B and K are the ones causing all the issues and calling me 30 times a day.\"},{\"index\":634,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I have 2 kids, 'Clark' and 'Kent'.

Due to the boys' ages, my family know I couldn't have carried both, unless I have the gestation period of a hamster or the longest labour ever. I have explained to them how this all came to be, but in my explanation I neglected to tell them which was my biological child.\\n\\nDue to my ex having a type, the other woman looked enough like me that the boys could pass for twins. Same dark hair, blue eyes, pale skin, and both cleft chins and dimples. My brother jokes that they look like tiny Supermen. People who know them refer to them as twins because aside from a few minor differences, they're practically identical.

Mum says if biology is irrelevant then it's not a big deal to tell her which of them is biologically mine. I said if she's so hung up on biology, then clearly it's a big deal to her and I don't want it to be a big deal, especially as the boys themselves don't know.\\n\\nMum feels this is incredibly selfish, narcissistic, and overall wrong.

If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were \\u201cclean\\u201d meaning, they didn\\u2019t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. \\n\\nSo you can imagine, i had literally 1 or 2 friends. By 18, i didn\\u2019t have any plans, i just packed my stuff and left. My parents weren\\u2019t happy and tried for months to get me to come home but i didn\\u2019t plan on it.

Everyone\\u2019s face kinda froze and i didn\\u2019t think much of it. \\n\\nMy mom asked who it was and i told her and she immediately gets annoyed? She started asking why he was leaving my bedroom, which he didn\\u2019t. The bathroom is the same way towards the bedroom so i could see why it would look like he left from my room. She and my dad proceeds to ask me why i have guys at my home, why is he 21 hanging around me (i just turned 20 but yea) it was like i was 15 again\\n\\nMy mom then insists i have him leave. At this point my friend and her boyfriend hears this and goes like wtf? I didn\\u2019t know what else to do but laugh. I said \\u201care you out of your mind\\u201d and laughed some more. I realized they were serious and said my goodbyes and hung up.

However some general things: \\n1. Our 27f daughter assumed she could live with and be financially supported by us in the year after her child was born because our eldest went through significant financial hardship when she was trying to have a baby due to paying for ivf\\/fertility treatments and as a result almost ended up homeless because they remortgaged their house to afford it but then her husband was in a car accident and needed time off work meaning they were unable to pay their mortgage and the bank claimed their home.\\n2. I dunno what I can say to convince you this is real, yes its from a throwaway because my main account has part of my real name on it and both my 27f daughter and my son and his wife are familiar with it. There were 3 edits to this post. Originally it included a couple of paragraphs about how our 27f daughter made some homophobic comments about my wife's brother getting married to another man, and also some statements she made towards the BLM movement, however that post was over the 3000 word count and i decided to remove them as they aren't applicable to the current situation and i wanted to focus more on our immediate family issue rather than get into a big lgbt\\/blm argument. When I reposted it the post was removed because \\\"this is not a debate sub\\\", so I changed the title and reposted it as it is.\\n3. My wife and i have been supporters of the blm movement since before we got married 33 years ago, I came from a very racist family who disowned my older sister for marrying a black man and then kicked me out as a 16yo for sneaking out of the house so I could go to my sisters wedding. We haven't really been LGBT supporters(we haven't been anti LGBT, just not a part of rallies\\/donations) until my wife's brother came out a few years ago and since then we have made more of an effort to go to parades and donation to things like the Trevor project.\\n\\nSecond edit to say that our 27yo daughter will not be homeless if we don't support her for the year following the birth. It was just supposed to be an opportunity for her to spend time with us as otherwise they live over 2 hours away. As far as Im aware they own their home outright and her husband is financially well off enough to support her during this time without our help. \\n\\nAlso our adoptive grandson is only 9 so a bit young to understand why some parts of the family don't like him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm not going to go into real detail but essentially my 27f daughter has recently said some very racist things. Since she married her husband she seems to have changed as a person and is much more distant and vicious towards the family, things came to a head last weekend at our first big family get together since covid when she said that our eldest daughters adopted son(who is black, he was adopted because our eldest and her husband are unable to have children) \\\"wasnt really a part of the family\\\" and that \\\"God didn't mean for you(eldest daughter) to have children, just accept what he gave you and stop forcing your options(referring to the son) on the rest of us\\\". Our eldest and her son were devastated and some very heated words were exchanged before my 27yo daughter and her husband stormed out. \\n\\nNow recently our 27yo daughter has announced she is pregnant, she and her husband were planning on moving into the cottage on our property after the baby is born so my wife and I can help out for the first year. During this time our daughter doesn't plan on working and has been clear that she expects us to contribute to her financial costs during the year(we had a similar arrangement with our eldest whe she was trying for a baby, and our son and his wife also spent 6 months living in the cottage after their twins were born). However after discussing with my wife we feel that this would make the rest of the family uncomfortable with visiting us(obviously eldest and her son no longer want to cone over while 27f and her husband are here and pur sons Latina wife has also expressed her discomfort around 27f and her husband)and we are uncomfortable supporting people who are so blatantly racist. \\n\\nWe told our daughter last Thursday in a zoom chat about our decision and she blew up at us, demanding to know why she wasn't allowed to express her option and arguing that we aren't black so why should we care? My wife became very upset and closed the chat and has refused to speak to our daughter since and she is blaming herself for not raising her better.

He even implied that he would go to my current company and \\\"reveal my secret\\\" which is ridiculous as I've provided my ID to them, so they know that this is not my \\\"official\\\" name??\\n\\nI was taken aback at how seriously angry he got at this, and I wanted to know...

I (24m) have a car rock, it used be my grandfathers and he would always have it in his car as a \\\"lucky totem\\\" and had it for about 30 years according to my mom, but he passed away when I was around 5. I don't have much to remember him besides a few pictures of us, his ring, a knife and this rock. When I turned 18 my mom gave me the knife, ring and rock because my grandfather wanted me to receive these on my 18th birthday. I keep his knife in my room, wear the ring everyday and in the past 6 years I've had kept that rock in my car too and kept it as a lucky totem as well. Sometimes when I drive ill have the rock in my hand and just rub my thumb over and it kind of gives me peace of mind. I don't really know how to explain it in words I guess.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo onto the story. This happened last night. My friend \\\"Jane\\\"(26F) car is currently in the shop for repairs of a accident (she got rear ended and it messed up her whole back end). So the past week she's has either been ubering or asking friends to pick her up when her shift is done and thats around 730 pm. Her work is about 30 minutes away from me and she lives about 10 minutes from me. So last night she called me at 7pm and asked me if I could pick her up and so I said sure no big deal. So I pick her up and everything was fine until I picked up  my rock and staring rubbing it, Jane asked what was in my hand. I showed it to her and said \\\"this is my lucky rock I sometimes rub it whenever I drive.\\\" She asked to hold it and I gave it to her. She told me that the rock is stupid and before I could say anything back she threw it out the window. I screamed \\\"What the fuck why did you do that?\\\". Jane said \\\"Rocks are stupid and lucky items dont work.\\\" At this point I'm probably 5 minutes away from her house so I pulled over in a grocery store lot and asked her to get out. Jane asked why I was making a big deal about so I told her the meaning behind the rock. And finally I said \\\"Until you find that rock and give it back to me, never call me for a ride and you're never allowed into my car again.\\\" She ended up getting out of my car and I drove to vicinity of where she threw it at and I spent about 2 hours trying to find it. During those 2 hours friends from our group called me asking what happened and I explained my side. Most of the group knew the significance of the rock because I've given them rides before and they asked about it. Those ones are on my side but the last few are calling me the asshole because I left a woman alone to walk home in the dark. I do feel guilty for kicking her out and I felt like I could've handled the situation better.\\n\\nSo reddit AITA for kicking my friend out of my car and banning her from entering my car over a rock?\\n\\nEdit: I will update if I do or don't find the rock.\\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for the kind words it really means alot. I haven't found it yet but I am getting a group together to help me search for it Friday. A few people have asked for updates so I'll probably give a more detailed one on Saturday or Sunday.\\nEdit 3: for some reason my update got removed but here it is Update: AITA for kicking my friend out of my car and telling her to never call me for a ride?\\nHello! A lot of people have asked for a update regarding this, I ended up looking for the rock on the day I posted it (Wednesday) and the day after. I couldn't find it on those days either. I called the friends who were on my side and asked if they were free Friday so they could help me look also, the ones who were 'against' me were also willing to come look because my other friends explained to them the importance of the rock and are now fully on my side. Friday comes along and we(there were 7 of us including me) started searching the whole street, we took the advice of some very helpful redditors i.e. throwing another rock out the car to see where it could land, searching farther up or down the street and searching the other side of the street too. One of my friends(rick) ended up finding it about 200 ft. down from where we were searching. I screamed a fuck yeah and basically jumped on him crying, I told him thanks and asked the group if I could buy them all dinner as thanks, they said sure so  we all agreed on pizza and beer. Then we went to Ricks place to eat, as we were talking the topic of Jane came up, someone asked if she's still part of the group. All I said was \\\"I don't care if she's in the group or not, I'm not gonna not gonna force you guys to stop being her friend, I'll be cordial and make small talk  with her and that's it.\\\" So as of right now Jane is still part of the group because two of them have been friends with her longer than the formation of the group (10+ years?). So the next day I call jane to let her know what happened, she immediately apologizes and doesn't give any excuse as to what happened or why she did it, she does feel guilty and told me she understands if she's out of the group. I just told her what I told the group and also \\\"Its going to take a long time for me to trust you again and maybe even longer for me to call you a friend.\\\" I ended the call after that and thanked my friends again for looking. \\n\\nSo that's really it I found my rock and Jane is still apart of the group but is like 4 arm lengths away from. I'm happy as hell for finding the rock! Thank you everyone for the advice and kind words. It really means a lot that and thank you so fucking much,.\"},{\"index\":870,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I am a 37 year old man and my roommate is an early-30s woman.

She pays about 30% of the rent because that's all she can afford.\\n\\nMy roommate has one particularly good friend who she invites over regularly. I do not like that woman at all. She is loud, self-centered, and has no concept of boundaries, property, or privacy. She has \\\"accidentally\\\" eaten my food and drunk my beer several times when she came over, and I have voiced my opinion about her to my roommate regularly. My roommate's response has always been \\\"as long as I'm paying my part of the rent, the company I keep is between them and me.\\\" \\n\\nOn Saturday night, she invited her friend over. As I often am in my room, I was completely naked, lying over my covers, reading a book. I like being naked and expect a reasonable amount of privacy from civilized people. \\n\\nWhen my roommate was in the bathroom, my door door flew open like it was rammed by a siege engine. Her friend had barged in to \\\"surprise\\\" me, and instead of frantically apologizing for violating my privacy (and seeing me naked), she burst out laughing as I fumbled to cover myself. By now my roommate had come out of the bathroom, and her friend shouted to her \\\"I saw his little ____!\\\" My roommate snort-laughed loudly.\\n\\nThe next morning my roommate was hung over, and so I told her that her time in the house was over and that she had a month to vacate. I looked up the laws in my state, and since I am the only person on the lease, I can legally kick her out as long as I give her proper notice. She told me that she warned her roommate about privacy after what happened, and I told her I don't care at all. She brought that woman into the house, she was entertained by my embarrassment, and I wasn't comfortable living with her for another day. I told her if it were legal I'd kick her out that second.\\n\\nMy roommate has been nasty with me all week, saying that she has nowhere to go. I don't care and keep telling her that she might want to start looking. Our mutual friend who I originally did the favor for has sided with her completely, and so I just blocked him.\\n\\nAm I going too far here, or am I not the asshole in this case?\"},{\"index\":871,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I feel like this is such a clich\\u00e9 reddit story but I\\u2019m really struggling with what to do here so..\\n\\nI am my mother\\u2019s oldest biological child.

Nothing else was mentioned to me about why the puppy was so cheap but I assumed my Dads friend Joe was just being generous. Looking back I was definitely naive but I'd been wanting a labrador pup for a long time and the offer was just too good to pass up. \\n\\nThat same day I drove over 2 hours to Joes farm to collect my new 3 month old labrador puppy and sign the paperwork transferring\\u00a0the ownership of the pup to me. Joe never mentioned anything else about the terms of the sale and I never signed any other paperwork or contract regarding further terms. \\n\\nI want to stress that in the period directly after the sale, neither Joe or my Dad discussed with me the apparent \\\"extra terms\\\" I had supposedly agreed to. \\n\\nUntil recently. I mentioned to my Dad that I had booked Jennifer (name of pup) for her desexing next month and my Dad immediately told me I had to cancel. He went on to explain that he had agreed (on my behalf) to allow Joe to use my labrador to breed more pups for him to sell. This is apparently why I was able to buy Jennifer for such a discounted rate.  I was shocked but frankly not surprised since my Dad has a long history of neglecting to\\nmention important details\\/lying by omission.\\n\\nAs far as I'm concerned, I never agreed to these terms so I'm not bound to them. Dad and Joe may have had a verbal agreement but I am the legal owner of Jennifer and there was no verbal (or written) agreement between me and Joe so I don't care. \\n\\nI called Joe and made it crystal clear to him that I absolutely was NOT planning to breed Jennifer, let alone give him the puppies to sell. He was upset, called me a few choice names, and demanded I pay back the difference between the discounted rate and the normal rate for Jennifer since I wasn't breeding her for him. I refused because I legally own Jennifer now and the sale is over. If he wanted me to breed Jennifer he should have talked to me about this personally because I was the buyer, not my Dad. \\n\\nJoe is apparently fuming, my Dad is angry because he doesn't understand why its a big deal, and other extended family members who know Joe think I'm being a bitch and should at least pay him back the difference. But I honestly just don't feel like I'm obligated to. It's their fault , especially Joe, for not mentioning these extra terms to me before the sale. He's the seller and he show know better when conducting his business. \\n\\nAlso according to the \\\"agreement\\\" I would have to breed Jennifer whenever Joe wanted (so I'm guessing nonstop).

More blood than anyone could ever imagine, cramping so bad that I had to miss school and couldn't eat or drink or do anything because the pain was so bad. \\n\\nIn my mother's eyes... I was a faker. Making things up for attention or to get out of tests. She refused to take me to see doctors or anything. I wasn't even allowed pain meds. \\n\\nWell, when I moved in with my then boyfriend at 27, he convinced me to GO SEE A DOCTOR because that wasn't healthy. And I did. I later got diagnosed with a rare reproductive issue (vague for privacy) that essentially could have been fixed if caught earlier. But it wasn't. The issue had gone on for long enough that the damage was pretty almosy irreparable. In the end, I was basically given the choice of surgery A, which would leave me infertile, with less complications and a lower fatality rate, or surgery B, which would leave me fertile, but with a higher risk of complications\\/death due to the severity of my issue.\\n\\nI chose surgery A. I can no longer have biological children. My then boyfriend and I are now married, and we're looking into other options to have a child. We're heavily leaning towards adoption, and I confided in my mother about this. \\n\\nBig mistake. She started scolding me and basically told me that I HAD to have biological children. She told me if I didn't have bio kids then I was a failure of a woman, and \\\"HOW DARE YOU LET THE BLOODLINE DIE!\\\" or something like that. She told me that if we adopted, then she would do everything in her power to make me and my husband look like terrible people so it fails. \\n\\nAnd, the icing on the cake, she told me that I should just \\\"Reverse The Surgery.\\\" I can't do that. It's physically impossible. It's not like getting my tubes tied. I literally no longer have a uterus or ovaries or any of it. There is NO WAY TO \\\"reverse\\\" this surgery. \\n\\nI went off on her. I explained that, and I explained that if she were a competent parent who actually did her job, then I wouldnt be infertile. I explained that if she had taken me to see doctors sooner, I wouldn't have to consider adoption. I called her a terrible mom and a terrible person, and I told her that if I ever do adopt a child, she would never get to meet them. \\n\\nShe went silent, and then hung up.

That kind of conditioning is really hard to get over. And for a long, long time my mom was the only woman in my life who was actually aware of periods and things.  Sure, if id gone earlier, my condition likely wouldn't have been as bad, but I still would have suffered. Honest to God, I had no one in my life to tell me that my symptoms were absolutely not normal. Until I moved in with my husband. He witnessed firsthand what one of my periods looked like and told me that if I didn't go to see a doctor, he'd drag me to one by my belt loops. My point is, I never went to see a doctor before I was 27 because I was brainwashed into thinking I was overdramatic.\\n\\nEdit 2: WOW. this got a lot more attention then I thought it would.

I hope the best for all of your life situations. \\n\\n4) If you think you have a medical issue, especially if you're female, stick to it. Go to a doctor, two doctors, five doctors. Find someone who will listen to you. Admittedly, I struck gold in that my doctors actually listened to me and were speedy about diagnosing me, but many aren't. Remember, you know your body better than anyone and if something is wrong, push the issue! \\n\\n5) I am going to look into therapy- I feel like I absolutely could benefit from it. This post and some of the comments are making me consider some of my mother's behavior through my life and I really need to think things over about her and my plans going forward. I'm considering limited contact unless she can prove she deserves otherwise.\\n\\n6) Yes, my husband is amazing and I'm so lucky to have him \\ud83d\\udc9e\\n\\n7) I've messaged most of my extended family explaining to them my side of the story. Most haven't seen the message yet, but the majority of the ones who have read it have apologized to me for not asking my side of the story first. \\n\\n8) Should I have gone to the doctor before age 27? Yes. Would it have lessened the severity of my issue? Most likely. Why didn't I? Because my mother gaslit me. I fully accept that I should've gone. But I didn't because of her actions in my teenage years. I consider her at least half to blame in this aspect.\\n\\n9) Do I think I'm an asshole? Now, no! When i wrote this, and before? Of course I did. Half my family was bullying me.

However, afterwards she struggled finding a job in her field and the one\\u2019s she did find didn\\u2019t pay well so she came back to me and asked me to help her get another degree. I told her I could help her take out a loan but I wasn\\u2019t paying and it caused a lot of problems between us and she went no contact. She ended up going to community college part time while working as a server with the help of her boyfriend.\\n\\nI helped my older two pay for their weddings and my youngest daughter recently got engaged. She started talking to me and her mom again and we were excited about the wedding. However, she started planning for things way out of her budget that her older sister\\/brother were able to have at their weddings. Her mom and I were worried that this wedding would not be good for her financially and decided to talk to her about it. My younger daughter told us she thought we would pay for most of it and was planning on having a high end wedding close to what my elder two had. My wife and I told her we were not going to drop 30k to pay for her wedding after she went years of no contact with us. Furthermore, my elder two paid for most of their own wedding, we just pitched in about 5k for each of them. They both make good money, well into the six-figure range.

We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a \\\"peak bagger\\\" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. \\n\\nFor reference, I am a 5'3\\\" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. \\n\\nOn Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. \\n\\nBF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. \\n\\nHe told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. \\n\\nWe've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend.

Two older sisters aren't part of this thankfully.\\n\\nOk so I currently live with my gf at what was my grandma's home. But I bought said home from mom a bit back for cheap (the house wasn't pristine and i've sunk a few thousand into it already and it's looking better). Well my mom lived in our childhood home with 31 y\\/o sis and bro for the last... forever. (two oldest sisters live in diff states) YS and Bro never moved out for longer than a year each before moving back. Both are absolute slobs who refuse to clean up after themselves. And they made our mom clean up after them. She couldn't stand mess and would clean just so she wouldn't have to live in filth. Eventually she (in her 60s) couldn't stand to live there anymore so I asked her to come live with me.\\n\\nThey essentially drove our mother out of her own home because they were slobs.\\n\\nWell she lived with me happily (my house is clean and she didn't have to work and just enjoyed her time in the garden) but she passed away not too long ago. I've barely been coping because out of all of my siblings I was closest with our mom. Our personalities just meshed well. Whereas my siblings didn't. She loved them (she wouldn't have cared for them for so long if she didn't) but they stressed her out unbelievably.\\n\\nWell I found out our mom left her house to me only. She left each of my sibs some money but the house and everything of hers in it is now mine. My sibs who live in that house didn't like it and pitched a fit. Said I 'manipulated mom at her weakest' into getting the house when they should have gotten it. I told them to go to hell and the only reason it probably got left to me is because mom knew I'd at least remember to pay the property tax each year so the house wouldn't get taken. Neither of them pay any bills (save for their phone bills...) so she probs doubted they'd keep the house long if she gave it to them.\\n\\nWell they expected me to follow in mom's footsteps and pay all the bills there for them. I laughed and told them that going forward they'd be paying rent and all utilities if they wanted to stay there and they'd need to keep the place clean or they were OUT. They flipped their shit and screamed that it was their childhood HOME and I couldn't do this! I said the deed is in my name so I very much CAN.\\n\\nI sent them a letter that basically said they can either pay rent or they'd be out. They refused so I sent them another letter saying they had 30 days to vacate the premises because I'd sold the house. They went apeshit but they didn't have a leg to stand on so they bailed. I've since cleaned up the place (it looked like a drug den and cost a lot to deep clean and fix stuff) and am renting it out to a nice Asian couple who have lots of exotic fish.\\n\\nTold some friends I lied about selling the house and they said it was an asshole move. AITA?\\n\\n**Edit:** To the people commenting 'why lie?' 'lying was pointless' or 'you were fine until you lied' need to understand that I know my siblings well. And I know for a fact that a regular eviction wouldn't have worked since they'd know the house was still mine, so they'd have not left and just squatted indefinitely. But once they thought the house wasn't mine they bailed (because they probs were worried the new homeowner would shoot them for trespassing). So lying was necessary imo.\\n\\n**Edit II:** I see a LOT of confusion about the house situation so to clear things up- I bought the house that originally belonged to my GRANDMA from my mom. The house said Grandma left to my mom. I live in that one with my gf. But my mom left me HER HOUSE that she bought herself when she was a young mom. That's the house I rent to the couple with the fish. There are TWO houses in this story. The one I live in (grandma's old home) and the one mom gave me (the one the couple with the fish are renting).

It just looks the same to me.\\n\\nThis is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.\\n\\nSo i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.\\n\\nThe professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.\\n\\n(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).\\n\\nAnyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! \\n\\nI got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here.

My grandmothers way of retaliating was to tell my mother (who had extreme Postpartum Depression) that my sister (2 months old at the time) rolled off the bed and fell onto the tile floors (this never happened). This obviously caused extreme panic on my moms end, which made her spiral because she was already suffering from the postpartum. \\n\\nBecause of this, I dont want my grandmother anywhere near my baby. I lived out of state when my twins were born so she didnt see them until they were 2 years old and she was never allowed around them alone. However, now that I live in the states and have a baby, she has been harping on me to let her meet my daughter. I kept telling her no, but gave no reason up until last night. Where I reminded her that where I witnessed her causing my mom unnecessary panic, I would not be allowing her near my child because I'm not going to chance her doing the same thing with me. \\n\\nMy grandmother lost it and really tried saying that that scenario never happened and that we made it all up to make her look bad. A lot of the family has also sided with her (she told everyone) and says that I need to \\\"let shit go\\\" and \\\"stop living in the past\\\".

When she came home we used a custom prosthetic that worked with her leg but it was clear that wouldn\\u2019t last forever. My late wife and I said we wanted to wait until she was fully settled into the family before getting the surgery. 2 years later my wife passed away(for reasons I don\\u2019t want to share) and that really put everything on hold, it was a very hard adjustment.

That was the day of my daughters surgery. I said I couldn\\u2019t come over and she got really annoyed. She kept throwing it in my face that the doctors called it a non-emergency surgery. She suggested I just drop my 8YO off at the hospital and then come over. I of course said no.

There's a lot of people dragging SIL in the comments, but I will note that she's generally a good person even though she may have come off badly in my post, I personally don't think it's her fault and suspect social media or peer pressure is the cause of niece feeling bad about her body, but that's just my personal speculation.\"},{\"index\":847,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I made this account because I'm tired of the passive aggressive bull this girl keeps throwing at me, so I want to see if I'm the ass or her. \\n\\nFirstly,  I'm a guy,  26, who tries to have the healthiest life style I can.

He may not be the most considerate person and I\\u2019ve brushed it aside since I\\u2019ve been very lonely for a while. When we first started, he used to cook a lot for me and that was great.

I mentioned that it was never a problem in the past and don\\u2019t understand why it\\u2019s an issue now. He just started yelling at me saying I was starting a stupid argument and that it\\u2019s not an issue. He doesn\\u2019t have the money to get takeout like he used or buy food. He said that because he was laid off, he needs me to buy all of the groceries, pay his half of the rent and utilities, and cook for him. \\n\\nWe then got into other issues of our relationship and things that have been building for a while. These are things I\\u2019d rather not get into, but nonetheless, I told him I\\u2019m tired and honestly would be happier without him. He stopped crying, got all red faced, and started screaming at me. I told him to get his stuff, go to his parent\\u2019s house, and not come back.  When he tried to fight it, I told him that I won\\u2019t hesitate to call the cops since the neighbors probably heard him screaming at me. This Monday, he and I are going to the leasing office to get him off the lease. I\\u2019m in the process of boxing up his stuff for him to move out.

Was I should just \\u201clive a little\\u201d and I needed some meat on my bones anyway.

We were all chatting in the living room, the night was winding down, but I knew I wouldn\\u2019t make it all the way back home. I excused myself to the restroom, but at the last second I decided rather than go to the guest bathroom on the other side of the house, I\\u2019d go to the half bath next to the living room.\\n\\nSo... I went. In all my loud, stinky glory I went. It lasted maybe five minutes but the damage was immeasurable. The bathroom stunk and when I came out it was obvious everyone heard. It was awkward.

We have one child together, Sarah (18). Now, Sarah is a trans woman and came out when she was 14. I am extremely happy that she felt comfortable enough to be herself but my ex didn't agree. She was happy when we thought we had a gay son but she couldn't accept the fact that we actually have a daughter.\\n\\nWhen we first split, I moved into a crappy one bedroom flat in a pretty rough area, I have since moved into a bungalow in a slightly better area. I didn't want Sarah having to come to that area so she stayed with her mum and I would visit her, take her out and phone her everyday. My ex was going out of her way to call Sarah 'he\\/him' and would use her old name constantly. She even went as far as joking about how it was 'just her luck that she'd have a tr\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*y for a child'. However, though it was absolutely disgusting, Sarah told me it was okay and at the very, very least she wasn't in any physical danger. I figured I'd deal with this until I found a better place. I'd offered to let Sarah take my room and I'd sleep on the couch but she wouldn't hear of it.\\n\\nTwo months ago. Sarah phoned me one night in absolute tears. She had been growing her hair out for ages, and at the rate her hair grows it reaches just below her shoulders. She was thrilled.\\n\\nThat night, my ex had offered to give her hair a little trim. She told Sarah it was to just cut off some of the dead ends. Sarah immediately said yes as this would help tidy her hair up a little bit and she had thought this was her mum's was of trying to accept her. She wasn't.\\n\\nMy ex cut a massive chunk out of her hair, bringing it back to just above her neck. Sarah was absolutely gutted. She had been working so hard to get to that point. When she told me, I saw red. Over the next couple of weeks I helped Sarah move her things into my house while her mum was out. We made sure we had all of her important documents and such and then I went with her to tell her mum that she was leaving. There was an argument and a few insults thrown but I got Sarah out and she's now living with me. We got her hair cut and styled into a pixie cut until it grows back.\\n\\nLast week, my ex posted on Facebook about her depression. She had been talking about how she had never felt so low and that it was worse that she didn't have anyone at home who could comfort her when she was feeling down. In the comments she mentioned that I 'brainwashed' Sarah into hating her and that if anything happens to her then it's on myself and Sarah for leaving her by herself. I couldn't help myself and posted a lengthy comment about how it was her fault that our daughter hated her and that if she had been a better mother than maybe our daughter would still want to be in her life.\\n\\nNeedless to say I've gotten some backlash. Even a few of my friends have said that I was a bit harsh. I don't know what to think here.\\n\\nedit - \\n\\nOkay, firstly I want to say thank you for all the kind and supportive comments, especially in regards to my daughter. I have shown her this thread and you guys genuinely don't know how happy you have made her. I am so grateful for that. \\n\\nSecondly, a  couple of people have asked about what my Facebook comment said. I figured I'd copy and paste it from a previous comment. Some things have been changed\\/ missed out for privacy reasons but this is the gist of it. \\n\\n\\\"Just want to clarify for everyone reading this post that Sarah is staying with me of her own accord. My ex had her chance to treat her DAUGHTER with the respect she deserves, accept and love her for who she is and make her feel safe in her own home.

But I, at the very least, work hard to make my daughter feel safe and loved and would never go out of my way to hurt her and make her feel like sh\\\\*t.\\n\\n\\\\*Ex's name\\\\* If you are reading this. YOU failed our daughter. YOU made her feel unloved and unwanted in her own home. YOU made her cry. YOU made her feel worthless. YOU are the reason that our daughter hates you. Not me. Not Sarah.

I am sorry that you are in a dark place but don't you dare try to pin this on me or my daughter.\\\"\\n\\nAs much as I am grateful to all the kind comments, I also accept that I am in the wrong for commenting in the first place. My ex used to do this a lot when we were together, making threats when I tried to leave her. I shouldn't have commented but I let my emotions get the best of me. Also I have found out that her sister is planning to move in with her for a little while, just in case my ex isn't lying.

Don\\u2019t get me wrong, Elise is not a bad person. My brothers really needed someone to cling to and she really takes good care for them. She makes dad smile again.\\n\\nHowever, she is a lot more controlling than my mom was. I am quite independent, do chores around the house, have friends and go out etc. But she insists that I should follow her rules, to be home at a certain time etc. I don\\u2019t like that. I\\u2019m used to have more freedom and am actually planning to move out next year, I don\\u2019t want to risk losing my friends over her controlling behavior. I am respectful towards her, trying not to pick a fight, but she\\u2019s not someone I would want to share me feelings with.\\n\\nShe also insists that I call her \\u2018mom\\u2019 like my brothers do but I refuse. For me there was only one mother in my life and calling Elise mom just feels wrong, as if I\\u2019m forgetting my real mom. I also feel like if I call her mom I would accept that she has authority over me, but I never chose this person, my dad did. My dad just wants everyone to get along and live a happy new family but is afraid of confrontation and in general just lacks a spine. He also doesn\\u2019t like it if anyone mentions my real mom so I can barely talk to him about her.\\n\\nElise has called me an unruly teenager multiple times. When I got home \\u2018late\\u2019 she gets angry. Among other things she\\u2019s told me at times that I refuse to accept her even though she\\u2019s trying, that I am the one thing stopping this family from being happy again.

His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. \\n\\nHere's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was \\\"it's between the two of them.\\\" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him.

Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. \\n\\nI can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as \\\"enough\\\" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear.

They come in and there I am, frozen in a dance pose like an idiot.\\n\\nI quickly ran to our room, yelling \\\"Sorry, wasn't expecting anyone!\\\" and was putting on clothes, when Nate come in. He was so angry. He said i was acting like a child and that I embarrassed him. His parents wanted Nate to drop them back asap, refusing to stay and his mom called me a lot of names and said the kids had seen 'everything' and that made me feel guilty af...\\n\\nHere's why I am losing sleep over this: On one hand, I didn't know they would come. I locked the door too so I feel like I didn't do anything wrong. I planned on cleaning up my mess before Nate came home too. Also, Nate and his mom insulted me a lot.\\n\\nBut when you look at it from their perspective, I was behaving like an immature person. The house was a mess, I looked a mess, there were baking supplies scattered. Nate just wanted to surprise me and do something nice.\\n\\nNate is still not completely talking to me, I don't know how to face his family, and I also know his sister told him to make me behave or smn... So I feel like I should apologise before things get worse but I can't decide for sure if i'm in the wrong here so I need your help.\\n\\nthank you for reading.\"},{\"index\":895,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I F33 am a nurse and I been crazy busy lately.

My husband told me his mom wanted to bring the family and celebrate Christmas at our house. I politely declined and explained that I can't be serving 10+ people when I'm committed to a very demanding. Very strict schedule. My mother in law still pissed at me for this and told the family that I was using my job as an excuse since \\\"I obviously can't even cook a decent meal let alone host a celebration\\\". I really thought that they let another family member host Christmas dinner.\\n\\nChristmas day at 2pm I got off work and went home feeling exhausted and could barely take a shower. My husband didn't leave the house and when I asked him about wether his family invited him for dinner he said no because \\\"I ruined it\\\" when I refused to let them come. I knew he was starting an argument I just left it at that. At 6pm the door rang and I saw his mom and dad walking in. I greeted them and brought them coffee and biscuits. They said they came to give us our gifts on behalf of the family and they stayed for over two hours. His mom started giving me looks and asking when she and her husband were going to eat dinner. I got up and decided to reheat the pizza we had from the night before and when his mom saw it she stared at me and asked if I was serious, she asked me where is Christmas dinner and was stunned that I didn't cook for the occasion. I told her I didn't cook because I wasn't expecting anyone to be invited to the house. She got upset and said that I should've cooked for the occasion REGARDLESS  of wether we had guests or not because she said it's part of the \\\"celebration\\\" and talked about how every home had a Christmas feast. She said I had no ettiquete and that I was clearly Starving her son by not cooking even on holidays.\\n\\nI got into an argument with her while my husband and his dad sat there watching. She called me disrespectful and to stop using my job as an excuse for my lack of function as a wife. Then they left.

She's all over the SM talking about me serving her pizza instead of a real Christmas dinner.\\n\\nEDIT\\/ My husband works in construction. Work has been slow lately he spends more time at home than me. He does cook meals whenever I'm working so I'm not sure why his mom thinks he's being treated unfairly.

Our parents have always kind of had us compete with each other and are especially sticklers for academics. My sister has always done much better than me on that front. Tbh, I've always found school very frustrating. It's not like I'm thick or anything, I know loads of stuff and often know the answers in class, I've just always struggled with focusing and putting my thoughts together coherently in a way teachers like. I also have a horrible memory, so exams are a nightmare; I can study and study and study something for *hours* sometimes and still not remember it when it comes to the test. And that's when I *can* study - sometimes I honestly really really want to but I just can't. Like I'll sit there, staring at my workbook for ages and there's just some block where I can't do it. My parents just kind of ignore all this and tell me to study harder like my sister. I try some of her study methods, and some of them help, but mostly they don't work for me. I always kinda thought I was just doomed to be shit at education. \\n\\nThe situation: I started dating a boy about a year ago whose big sister is a psychologist. A few months ago, he and I were talking about school while she was in the room and she kinda said \\\"sorry to butt in, but have you ever been tested for ADHD?\\\" I said I hadn't, because I didn't think I had it. The image I had of ADHD was always the rambunctious kid who played class clown, which is very much not me. She explained that wasn't always the case and a lot of the things I was describing sounded like ADHD symptoms. I relayed this to my parents and they both (especially my mum) got upset and said that I'm just looking for a way to not take accountability and that ADHD didn't exist in their day. I got upset, but talked to my BFs sister again, and she pointed me in the right direction to go and talk to people about it without my parents overseeing. Obviously with the Rona, it was difficult but I managed to get the necessary appointments and *finally* had it comfirmed that I have ADHD.\\n\\nNow my parents are mad. They keep on about how I'm just trying to remove responsibility and how they don't recognise the diagnosis as valid. They've also said they don't want me talking to my boyfriend any more, saying his family are a bad influence. We're both upset about it.

He got all huffy and said he \\\"knew what the fuck \\\\[he\\\\] was doing\\\" and I should mind my business. I said anything involving our daughter IS my business. He said he didn't need my help, and I should just handle the birthday party and he'd get the cake. I said okay then they left for the weekend.\\n\\nI know my Ex. He puts things off that aren't about him. I knew he was going to forget to order. Usually I'd pester him so he wouldn't forget.

Very well behaved for his age. I was confused after she complained about him. She said she saw his dad come over to pick him up and didn't feel comfortable when she saw him because he's a Police Officer and she had an unpleasant incident with the police (bc of something her boyfriend did) that she needed therapy for and struggled alot from. She wanted me to let the child go and tell the parent to look for another daycare. \\n\\nHe usually arrives at 3pm to pick the kid up. From what I understand his wife's sick. I refused. I've no good reason to let the child go. My sister refused to drop it and started being mean to the dad. It was unprofessional of her. I told her she either be respectful or I won't have her work with me anymore. 2d ago she sent an email to the dad telling him we won't be welcoming his kid at the daycare anymore. He came to talk to me and I was livid when I saw the email. \\nhe asked why and talked about his kid wanting to stay bc he's friends with other kids. Talked about not being able to find a daycare closer than ours. I lashed out at my sister and I told her she's no longer able to work at the daycare because of her behavior. We got into an argument and she left after saying I was being unsupportive and inconsiderate.\\n\\nMy parents called me saying I shouldn't have kicked my sister out and now causing her to lose her apartment. They argued I have no regard for my sister' 'trauma' &amp; I should've let the child go and support her bc she's my sister. Everyone shamed me and claimed I had messed up priorities.

Walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that.

At this point in time, I have paid more for the car than he has, as I\\u2019ve only had it for four months. And yes, I work (or rather worked... I got laid off back when everything shut down)\\n\\nSecond edit for info: I didn\\u2019t leave her stranded. She had her phone, and if she chose not to call someone, that\\u2019s on her.\\n\\nAlso: You know how some people go really fast in a residential neighborhood?

Initially very happy for me, my brother mentioned how he needs a larger home for his family and how I should give up on this opportunity to give him money for his house and spend the rest on refurbishing their new home.

While walking up I briefly noticed that her leggings are see-thru and when she bends down in her squats you can easily tell she's also not wearing underwear. Thats not my business, thats her choice. But it made me uncomfortable to take a rack that was kinda behind her. I had been waiting my entire gym session for one of these racks to open up, and this was my last lift before leaving, so I went ahead and took it.\\n\\nI went through my workout as normal. After every set I check my phone for 5-20 seconds. I track every single set for every single lift in a spreadsheet to note how much I lifted and for how many reps. Sometimes I need to remind myself what I did last week to make sure I'm progressing. Sometimes I'm just checking the time. Sometimes I'm changing the song on my Spotify. Tonight specifically, there was a very important basketball game being played so I wanted to keep up with the score. So I use my phone a lot at the gym.\\n\\nI finished my 3rd set when Belinda turns around and walks up to me, with her phone up yelling \\\"what the fuck are you doing? fucking perv stop pictures of me.\\\" I'm caught completely off-guard, but I explain that I'm just taking notes on what I'm lifting.

She's yelling that if I have nothing to hide I should have no problem showing her, so I insist on going to gym management.\\n\\nOnce at the front we both explain our stories (she's still recording). The normal gym attendee asks me if I'm willing to show her, a neutral 3rd party, my pics\\/vids. She also says if I have nothing to hide its not a big deal and we can squash it right now. I refuse. I have my own uncensored pics in there plus those of my gf. I'm not gonna let anyone force me to show them for some bullshit. I do show her my spreadsheet which shows its been revised over 15 times in the past 50 minutes, so that proves what I was using my phone for. That was received well, but they still expected me to prove my innocence.\\n\\nI told them they need to review the cameras. Apparently only the manager has access to them so I was told he'd call me before the end of the night (in about an hour).

She'd completely disregard our fears and concerns as parents and claim we don't know what's best for her grandson by trying to control doctors appointments\\/arguing with doctors. Criticizing and telling them how to do their job\\/ bringing medication that her friend doctor prescribed without even diagnosing my son.\\n\\nShe'd get mad if we don't comply and do what she tells us.

In the past couple of months he got worse. They have 2 kids (nephew 4 and niece 6)\\nI agreed to take the kids in to look after them and help my sister focus on her husband.\\n\\nA week ago I got a call at 6:50 from my sister crying telling me her husband just passed away. It was so devastating. I was still in bed when I got the news. I checked on the kids and they were asleep. \\nI had to go see my sister and be with her. I asked my husband to keep an eye on the kids and warned him to not tell them about their father's passing til their mom get there and tell them herself in her own way since she made me promise to wait til she tell them herself. He noded but said telling them the sooner the better. I told him it was none of his business and he needed to respect their mother's wish. He said I could go and he'd watch the kids.\\n\\n\\nAn hour later. My phone rang while I was with my sister and it was my husband telling me to get home asap because the kids had a break down after he told them their father passed. I was dumbfounded and so so mad and helpess. I asked why he told them but I couldn't hear his reply because the kids were crying loudly in the background. Their mother heard and fugured they found out. She told me to drive her to see them. I apologized for what my husband did but she didn't respond.\\n\\nWe got home and it was a mess. My heart sank seeing the kids crying for their dad like that. Their mom took them inside the room and shut the door.\\nI lost it on my husband and he said he didn't want to say anything even made them breakfast but when he heard the kids talk about what they were going to do when they see their dad soon he felt the urge to tell them. I yelled at him for going against my sister's wishes. He apologized to my sister but she said she doesn't want him to see him because the kids stopped talking from their trauma. He wanted to go the funeral but I told him my sister doesn't want to see him and I'm respecting her wish. He got upset saying I excluded him from family event which was unfair and flat out petty. He said he couldn't help it so I shouldn't hold him accountable because it just happened.\\n\\nBut i felt ashamed and a major let down for my sister because she stated her wishes and he didn't respect them.\"},{\"index\":745,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I live in a housing unit \\/ dorm just outside of our college. It's not affiliated and is run by a third party company. It's a bit average, but it's an nice place to live and is a bit cheaper than living on campus.\\n\\nThe problem is our room keys. We use cards with magnetic strips on the back, like you would find in a motel. Most of these cards are between 3 and 6 years old, and in terrible condition - when you move in, you get given cards from the last people in that room and if you're lucky, you have minimal problems, but this is the minority more than the majority.\\n\\nIf you want a replacement card for any reason, you are charged $250. Lost, damaged or just not working - it's $250. Most people just make sure they come and go during office hours so the RA can let them in if their card doesn't work, or people just share within a room as they might have 1 working card between 4 people. This doesn't really work for me, because I work until 4am most nights, so if my card doesn't work, I have to sleep in my car until someone can let me into the building at 8am.\\n\\nRecently my card stopped working altogether - wouldn't swipe in at all. The office staff told me it would be $250, despite the card being around since the beginning of time, which is clear because you can't even read the name of the company that was once printed on it. No exceptions. Now this sucks, because I - like most people here, don't just have a spare $250 for a card.\\n\\nSo I did a bit of research. A card with a mag stripe doesn't have a lot of security on it. So I purchased a $85 card reader\\/writer from Amazon and had it sent to me overnight. The next day, I borrowed a roommates card, and cloned it onto a new blank card (the machine came with 20) and it worked amazingly. Problem solved. Of course, my roommates heard about this, so I cloned all their broken, worn cards onto new ones and we just threw the old ones into the office drop box.\\n\\nThis spread like wildfire, and when everyone started coming back after COVID restrictions, I was the go-to person for card replacements. I charged people $2 for the card ($1 to help me pay off the machine and $1 for the blank card) and then just threw the damaged cards in the office drop box as well.\\n\\nThe building administration caught on after I had done about 50 cards and asked to speak with me. They gave me a massive lecture on how I was depriving them of much needed income during a pandemic and that it was a security issue that I was cloning cards and said I need to stop what I was doing and they will be the only people who can provide cards.\\n\\nI thought I was doing something good and helping out people who couldn't afford the replacement, but the lecture the administrators gave me got me thinking that I may be the AH as they're pretty good to us otherwise.\"},{\"index\":746,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"\\nMe (31F) and My husband (35M) have been married for 14months.

I walked in and saw my husband sitting and his niece in a carseat by the table. I asked and he said his sister had work and wanted him to watch his niece. His family were out of town so there was no one else beside him. I noticed the restaurant staff were giving us looks since it's not a childfriendly restuarant and I was worried the baby'd cry or something. She was asleep then.\\n\\nWe ordered our meals. While he was calming his niece down cause she was crying out loud.

Especially when he started singing \\u201cyoure welcome\\u201d from Moana movie while swinging her. I got up to the restroom. Few mins later I heard him arguing loudly. I went to see that he was actually trying to change his niece's diaper on the table. The waitress was arguing with him. I was in shock. The manager came after my husband said he'd take a minute to get it done. The manager spoke to me and asked me to leave eventually. I was livid. We left and I blew up outside. Asked my husband why the table while people were eating. That he could've told me. Otherwise I wouldn't have picked a restaurant that doesn't allow infants. That he embarrassed me .ruined dinner and got us kicked out.\\n\\n\\nHe started arguing with me like I was one of his students after I refused to get in the car. Giving me 0\\/10 for my reaction and claiming I picked a bad restaurant.\\nSaid that he was helping his sister. And I needed to understand that. After the argument I took an uber and went home. He went to his sister's place and called saying I shouldn't have left like that and make him feel guilty for wanting to help. But I didn't respond.\\n\\n[Edit] I just want to say that my Husband is the one who insists on taking his niece. He doesn't consider this babysitting he just loves to be with her and take care of her. He said he wants us to adopt since it's our only way of having children (medical reasons) he absolutely adores kids so I understand his bond with his niece.

Despite all of this, we're not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her once a year in passing.\\n\\nTo make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was the only person who could help. I couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.\\n\\nIt took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.\\n\\nI'm just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn't child proof, I have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I'm in school.

They work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. They left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because I'm not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.\\n\\nI didn't \\\"put the kid up for adoption\\\" it doesn't work like that. I contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out.

We do our best to engage her; family walks, game night, cooking together, but she is still feeling pretty down.

I won\\u2019t lie, those were very tough years for our family. My daughter is an only child and was used to our full attention and engagement. It was a hard transition for her to have her father not be able to care for her like he used to and myself having to split my time between her and my husband.\\n\\nWe had a lot of support from our family and we were able to maintain her lifestyle with their help. She didn\\u2019t have to quit any teams, she never missed school. I do acknowledge that emotionally there was damage so we did family therapy for a years.\\n\\nYesterday she was in a bad mood. During dinner I asked her what was going on and she went into this explosive rant about how many issues she developed due to us. Apparently we are responsible for her grades slipping, her relationships failing, her weight gain, etc.\\n\\nShe tied it all back to her missing crucial development during the years where her father had cancer.\\n\\nAt one point she says something like \\u201cHas it ever occurred to you that maybe you should apologize?

I also know that my husband already feels a great deal of guilt for putting our family through so much turmoil.\\n\\nI love my daughter and want her to be happy.

My dad is pissed. He said it was so unbelievably petty and mean spirited to go to the girls parents over \\\"sibling issues\\\". I told my dad nothing between us would ever be sibling issues, because we're not siblings and my siblings (younger brother and sister) would never do that to another person.\\n\\nMy stepsister has been suspended right now but it looks like she'll be expelled Thursday when the big meeting happens.

I (15f) didn't really like Alice because I think she replaced my mom too soon. My mom died of cancer 2 years ago and she and dad started dating 8 months after. I try to be as polite as I can whenever she's around or starts a conversation with me. Dad never forced me to have a relationship with her and I can also see that she's not interested in having one.\\n\\nAfter they got engaged, Alice approached me and said we needed to talk. She said she has a clear vision of how she wants her wedding to be and that I have to comply so that everything will be perfect. I said sure and asked her what I need to do. She said, \\\"first, I want you to cut your hair short; second, you can't wear heels and lastly, only wear light make up and no fake lashes. Okay?\\\" I let her finish before I responded. I said I can do the second and third but I will not be cutting my hair. My mom loves my hair and helped me grow them thick and healthy. I got my blonde wavy hair from my mom so I will keep it long. Alice accused me of wanting to upstage her. I said that's not what I'm trying to do and I think it's unfair since I know she didn't make these demands on her other female guests. She then called me a selfish brat and told me she'll tell my dad about how I \\\"disrespected her\\\". \\n\\nMy dad then got involved and told me to just cut my hair because it will grow back anyway. I said her request is ridiculous and I'd rather not attend their wedding than to cut my hair. \\n\\nI think I have put my dad in a tight situation and I am now considering cutting my hair because I know my presence in the wedding will make my dad happy. But growing my hair back to lower back length will take a long time. \\n\\nAITA if I refuse to cut my hair?\\n\\nEdit: I am 5'7 while Alice is 5'6 so I kinda understand why she wants me to wear flats.

I got my hair, eyes and smile from her.\\n\\nEdit 3: Thank you so much for all your kind words. My mom's parents live in Ireland.

I rely on the treatment from the VA systems for my healthcare.  Which in my personal experiences has always been wonderful in my area.  A few weeks ago I was rushed to the ER with what was the worst head pain I had ever felt and it had come on in an instant.  CT ended up being clear and it was diagnosed as a migraine.  The next day is when hell started for me.\\n\\nEnter two weeks of near-constant agonizing pain. A severely swollen left temple, bad jaw pain, my vision in my left eye was getting worse\\/seeing double, and there were other symptoms stacked on top of those.  I had been requesting to be seen immediately by my GP (I have most of these requests backed up in emails) and was blown off.  I had a strong hunch at what was wrong with me even though (according to the wise Dr. Google) not suppose to get temporal arteritis until at least age 50. I just wanted to be taken seriously bc I know my body.  I feel I have a good grasp on my personal pain levels bc of injuries I have suffered in the military and this was the worst pain I have ever experienced by leaps and bounds.  And it never relented.\\n\\nFinally, my GP saw me and instantly changed her tune.  To start treatment I was to get a biopsy of my left temporal artery.  The ENT doctor called me to set that appointment up.  Only he wouldn't.  He told me I had an actual 0% chance of having this and I was wasting mine and theirs if I came it bc I was too young.  He made it clear that he was not entertaining the idea of seeing me at all and ended the phone call. It took another 24 hours of fights\\/emails\\/phone calls and being treated like crap to get the biopsy set up for the following morning.   Hey, guess what-I freaking have it.\\n\\nI am being treated for it but I have suffered permanent vision loss in my left eye bc of the delay in treatment.  Let alone what else bc I haven't even been fully informed on the extent of this disease yet. I want accountability.  I want this drastic mistake to be learned from and other people not to suffer my same type of treatment.  Only people around me are telling me my anger is \\\"too much.\\\"   That I would be the asshole if I \\\"went after doctors' careers\\\"  Really?  Looking for the judgment so I can make sense of this all and make a decision.  And oh yeah. I would have died as a result of this remaining untreated and it could have happened at any time.  So, that's what people are basing their opinion on.  \\\"You didn't die\\/they ended up saving your life\\/it could have been worse.\\\"  Thoughts?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate on 9\\/14\\/2021\\n\\n   A lot has happened since my original post and I have come to some realizations and also some life changes that I'm happy with the results.  First, let me say that the initial head pain has been gone since I got treatment for it (which was prednisone) although we stopped the treatment after a short time and the pain did not return.  I have had some milder flare-ups but with most, I feel lifestyle (a lot of stress reduction) changes have had the most impact on this positive outcome.\\n\\n   I was approached soon after this was posted 4 months ago about doing a national story and I was intrigued at first I'll admit but then changed my mind as I felt I didn't even understand the full scoop of what had happened.  In situations like these, I'm left wondering- Is there really a good guy or a bad guy here at all?  When we're in pain and scared we rightfully want answers but there just sometimes aren't any- or at least none that you are getting.  Our current medical system kneecaps both patients and doctors.  It's designed in a way that keeps both parties at each other's throats, one never really trusting the other.  Both blaming each other for their problems. When our very culture fosters a discourse that seems to get the most attention when disfunction and broken communication are the key elements- no freaking wonder we feel most of the time we're screaming into the void with no answers.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n   Because of the arterial biopsy, I have what I can only assume is some pretty fucked up nerves on the left side of my head now.  The actual site of the insision lights up like an electric Christmas tree anytime anything even brushes it.  Sending lightning forks of fire\\/electric pain\\/tingles across my skull.  Which is a little unfortunate bc I wear glasses lol!  The vision in my left eye is still messed up some as well.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n  As far as holding people accountable and making changes I feel like I am meeting those goals- just in different ways than I saw at first. I've met so many people that have needed help advocating for themselves and feel unheard.  I've also talked to many in the healthcare profession that feel unappreciated and given less credit than a five-minute search on Google.  (btw learn like I did and stop using Google to both freak yourself out and be the be-all-end-all of your knowledge base)  While I don't have a magical plan to suddenly fix all of these problems I can say at least for myself I am now putting in a lot more effort to communicate with my healthcare staff- and just people in general I'd say.  Good communication takes more time but you get better results and end up saving yourself time and hassle in the long run.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR:  My skull is now an electric fence if touched so that's a neat trick. Communication is good- don't be a dick- eat your vegetables.  \"},{\"index\":952,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My sister (25f) and I (22f) grew up in the deep south, my dad is almost 400 lbs and my mom is close.

I became a personal trainer last year and got a rhinoplasty recently to fix my crooked humped nose. My sister decided to move up with me. My sister was not very approving of my weight loss nor was she happy I did alot to change my appereance. While we get along wonderfully most of the time we still have fights about her thinking I'm vain.

Frankly I dont care what she looks like I just want her to be healthy and confident.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy sister sometimes acts out at me alot especially when it comes to guys. When we have gone to bars people can be cruel saying \\\"what youre sisters couldnt tell\\\" or outwardly paying more attention to me. I defend her when I see it but it still hurts her confidence she has cried to me multiple times about dating asking why cant anyone accpet her for who she is. In Jan my boyfriend of 2 yrs cheated on me. My sister told me that maybe he left me because I was too vain and high maitinence. I ignored her. Around the time of the break up she started dating a guy, and I was happy for her.

They dont talk and just watch tv, she hasnt met his friends or family yet also. She complains how he never posts about her on social media.

Originally we were going to have a very low budget wedding because neither of us were particularly wealthy and have little financial support from our parents(hers are homophobic and mine are just not well off enough to spend money on a wedding), but now we plan on having a slightly bigger wedding. However during these discussions my mother has been getting increasingly upset at the amount im spending(wedding will be around 40-50k all up including honeymoon and partner is contributing 12k, so its not like we're spending an astronomical amount), and has repeatedly suggested that we stick to our low budget plans and give money to her for my siblings college funds instead. \\n\\nThese comments have been confusing me because she has told me in the past that she got 20k when I was born to put towards my college fund from her parents and then 10k for each of my siblings. I got though college on scholarships and my part time job so presumably she has 50k already for my siblings college fund.\\n\\nThis came to a head about a week ago when she came with me to go to my fitting for my wedding dress and she saw the price tag($3k), she had a complete meltdown in the store about me wasting money and how she needed it and I confronted her about the college fund. She admitted that she and my dad had spent the money on trips away, alcohol and gambling a d now there was almost nothing left. I said if she wasted 50k meant for her children's college funds then why should I give her any more?

Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll \\\"make it up to me.\\\" \\n\\nI've never hated a human being as much as I hate him.

It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table.

Either pointing out 'plot holes' or just talking down about the movie in one way or another.\\n\\nI never act this way when it's his turn to pick the movie. Even if I don't care for it. Like the last movie he chose, The Fountain. I was so confused until half way through and then bored the rest of the film. But I didn't talk during the movie or constantly dump on it either. And even at the end when he asked what I thought I said it was alright, even though I thought the movie wasn't good. It tried to do a bunch of different things all at once and ended up doing nothing. But he seemed really fond of it so I didn't want to hurt his feelings.\\n\\nBut he doesn't seem to have that mindset when it comes to him watching my picks. I've told him to shush and to just watch the movies but he just sighs loudly and says they're boring. If I tell him to stop he gets all huffy and goes totally silent and usually takes his phone out to play a game or scroll the internet, totally ignoring me and the movie. It really hurts my feelings.\\n\\nAnd yesterday was my turn to choose again, and I picked a good movie that really hit me hard as a kid (I bawled when I first watched it and still tear up to this day). And I told him this movie was special to me but he barely got 10 minutes into it before he started up saying it was boring and childish. It is a kids movie but that doesn't make it boring.

He said I was being a baby and to turn it back on. I refused and just told him to pick something to watch instead, then I sat on the couch.

So I started to ask him to go back to his apartment for the night but he interrupted me by yelling how since I couldn't have my way I was kicking him out. It really scared me because he'd never screamed at me before, even when he'd raise his voice during arguments he never full on screamed at me.

They were actually pretty against me using ASL at all. Well I took ASL in highschool against my parents wishes and then got into a deaf university.\\n\\nAlthough I couldn't sign fluently when I started, I finally felt accepted and understood, the deaf community was nothing but welcoming. I became fluent in ASL after a few months and stopped wearing my processors completely as there was no need for them any more. I honestly didn't realize how alone I had felt until I didn't feel that way anymore.\\n\\nI also met my fiance at college, he is from a very large family of deaf people. Everyone he knows even in his far extended family is deaf, HOH, CODA or SODA and everyone is fluent in sign. I love his family so much.\\n\\nWe've been together for 4 years now, he proposed last may. We've been planning the wedding and decided to have it fully in ASL, the pastor at our churches deaf program agreed to do the ceremony. My extended family of hearing people is very small, just my mom, my dad, my sister, my brothers, my aunt, my uncle and my cousin(my cousin is learning sign). Whereas my fianc\\u00e9's huge extended family who are all deaf or sign fluently will be there and most of our friends are deaf or know sign.\\n\\nWe decided to get an interpreter for the hearing people though so they'd know what was going on. Our wedding is in August so we just sent the invites. The invite mentions that it will be in ASL but will have an interpreter for those who are \\\"Signing impaired\\\" which is kinda just  a joke.\\n\\nBut my mom started texting me and tried to convince me that it should be in English and have an ASL interpreter. I feel like it's our wedding so we should have it in our first language but my mom thinks that we are in America so english should be the first language and anyone who doesn't choose to \\\"get cured\\\"(Get an implant) should get an interpreter. She also said it was disrespectful to say \\\"Signing impaired\\\" I don't think she realizes the irony as she always refers to me as hearing impaired. During the entire conversation she kept repeating that 'I should have never let you go to that school.'\\n\\nMy mom also says that the deaf people should be used to having interpreters whereas she's never had one before so it will make it harder to understand. AITA here? Should I just have the ceremony in english because I guess that's the more normal way of communication even though we consider sign our primary language?\\n\\nEdit to clarify some things:\\n\\n1. I can't cut off my parents as I'm currently helping pay for my little brother to go to a school for autistic kids.\\n2. We can't sign and speak at the same time. The pastor and my fianc\\u00e9 can't speak, I can but choose not to unless I absolutely have to.\\n3. My parents didn't only not learn ASL but they explicitly prevented me from it growing up. We lived in Austin Texas my whole childhood and there was a school for the deaf 10 minutes from our house but they specifically said they would never let me go there.\\n4. (Adding this later) Exact words from the invite \\\"Reception will be held in ASL, English interpreters will be provided for the 'signing impaired'.\\\" I literally put it in quotations\\n5. The deaf community didn't indoctrinate me into not wearing my processors, I just started using ASL more and More and then I needed a surgery to adjust the implant but I decided to just not get the surgery and stop wearing them, there was no real point in it and I didn't feel like getting an unnecessary surgery.\\n6. Another edit: To those of you questioning and even mad at me for not wanting to wear implants, you don't hear normally. Like a lot of people say things like \\\"Don't you want to hear music? or Birds chirping?\\\" Music through CI's suck at least for me, even when I used to wear CI's all the time I would take them off to listen to music. And no, background noise like birds chirping makes it harder for the microphone to pickup other noises like people talking. \"},{\"index\":802,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"Recently I (25m) got engaged to my amazing fiancee (24f) Amy. I was the happiest I have ever been when Amy said yes and was nothing but excited for our wedding. We started planning the venues, the dates and the invites. When talking about who to invite, we both agreed to invite out coworkers as we have worked in our respective jobs for years and like them all. As I checked that off the list, Amy spoke up and said everyone from my job can come except my work friend Tally (26f). Tally is also one of my close friends so this surprised me that Amy didn't want to invite her. She has met Tally multiple times and there didn't seem to be any issues. When I asked why, she said she just doesn't like her and finds our friendship uncomfortable, saying she thinks that Tally is the type of person to try to sway taken men and be the center of attention. After talking some more to see where she got this idea, it turned out this was based on nothing but Tally's looks as even Amy admitted that Tally is always very kind to her. But still, Amy is adamant about Tally not going and said that she makes her insecure. Amy is a beautiful woman so I dont know why she feels this way.\\n\\nI told Amy that if it makes her feel comfortable not having Tally at the wedding then that is fine, BUT before invitations go out I wanted to speak to her privately to let her know to save embarrassment. Amy agreed and that was really that, we didn't speak on the matter after. A week or so later i went into work and Tally started to ignore me, only really talking if it was work related. I was confused as it isnt just her, our coworkers have started to ignore her and acting strange to me. So I contacted her bf, only for him to be sarcastic on the phone. I asked what the problem was when he asked if I actually didnt know what happened. He then filled me in. Turned out a few days earlier Amy came to my work on my day off with invitations (I had no idea she even made them yet) and handed everyone an invite in front of Tally, then saying to Tally \\\"you aren't invited, women like you aren't welcome\\\" which has sparked everyone suggesting she is my \\\"other woman\\\". Since then she has been harassed by some guys at work and shunned by the women. She is now looking for another job.\\n\\nThis pissed me off and I apologised profusely as I didn't know. When I got home that night I confronted Amy about this. She denied it at first, but then told me she did it but it is now not an issue because she's quitting her job. I flipped on her saying how she clearly didnt trust me to say and that she crossed a line doing all this behind my back. She didn't see the problem and got upset asking me why I'm so mad, me responding \\\"if we are really going to get married, get your insecurities in check and grow up\\\". I stayed at a friends since but have had texts from Amy, her friends and her mother saying I was an asshole for this and that Amy doesn't deserve this treatment. AITA?\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nI should have explained better 2 things:\\n1. I have made many attempts to speak to Tally privately to find out what was happening prior to contacting her bf. She brushed me off by saying she either had work to do or that there was nothing to talk about. No one would really speak to me so I contacted her bf as a last resort. Her bf says he is going to pass onto Tally what I said to him on the phone.\\n\\n2. The wedding is currently on hold, that is also why I'm staying at my friends. Need some distance to figure stuff out. I made the post because of all the texts.\\n\\nEdit 2:\\n\\nJesus this blew up, and I must say thank you to everyone for the advice you are giving me. But there is one thing I must clear up.... the whole suggestion that I may have cheated on Amy with Tally. \\n\\nAll I can ask is can people of the opposite sex not be friends without anything untoward happening? Nothing has or ever will happen with Tally, no feelings, nothing adult, absolutely nothing! Tally is happy and inlove, her boyfriend is someone I also consider a close friend, I was happy with Amy (prior to this) and Tally is more like a sister to me. I find it pretty disturbing that people are even suggesting that I did something with Tally. Ask yourself this, why in gods green earth would I let and encourage Amy to meet Tally in the first place if anything had happened? That would be messed up beyond belief. \\n\\nAlso I don't work in an office. I have no idea where people are getting this idea from since I never said where or what industry I work in. I work in a retail chain... nothing special.\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\n1. What am I planning to do about Tally?\\n\\nUnfortunately due to what Amy has done, all I can really do is damage control. Of course I am planning to explain to everyone what has happened, I do not want Tally to be going through this. She is a genuinely kind person who does not deserve any of this. I am actually on my way to speak to our boss at the moment to see what can be done. Tally's boyfriend is also saying he will speak to her on my behalf and see if he can get her to talk to me. Hopefully will have an update by tomorrow.\"},{\"index\":794,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My girlfriend and I had planned to get married on Saturday. We wrapped up all our planning around Halloween, all that was left was to ring some time this week and make sure everything was running smoothly.\\n\\nShe called the venue and the person she spoke to asked her to confirm some changes she'd apparently made. My girlfriend had no clue what he was talking about, and he reminded her of all the changes that had been put in recently. We had not approved any of these changes. We were able to get some of it put back the way it was but there are some things that we couldn't change back at such short notice.\\n\\nThe venue forwarded us the emails asking for the changes so we could look over them. Our communication was being done via an email account we created solely for wedding stuff, and the email address which asked for the changes is the exact same address, except 2 letters are switched round. The venue is very apologetic for not calling us directly but can only fix so much of it at this stage.\\n\\nWe think we know what happened. The whole time we were planning the wedding we got pushback from both sets of parents, and the stuff they had the biggest issues with have all been changed. I'm willing to bet that all of this was related to at least one of our respective parents. We don't know anyone who would want to fuck with us or the wedding this badly except our parents, who got pissy when we told them they couldn't financially contribute to the wedding because they were trying to trade their money for whatever wedding stuff they wanted.\\n\\nRight now the stuff that we wanted that is still in this wedding is my suit, the venue and the DJ. My girlfriend has gone to pick up her dress and she's not heard from the shop so we're assuming that hasn't changed. I'm calling round everyone and it looks like the menu has been changed, as has the guest list and the cake. We paid for the wedding we'd planned and it looks like any additional costs from the changes (such as the extra people) were paid for by someone else, but they wouldn't give me any of the card info for legal reasons.\\n\\nWe probably won't be speaking to our parents again after this, unless one of them owns up in which case we'll just stop speaking to that one, but this feels like a joint effort as it's dealt with both sets of parent's complaints.\\n\\nBefore my girlfriend left to get the dress she gave me permission to post this as we are seriously considering eloping. We have the marriage certificate here, the honeymoon is unaltered and exactly what we wanted, and there's a few appointments we could make between now and Saturday at the town hall to get the certificate legally signed\\/filed.\\n\\nHowever, we now have around 200 people attending this wedding in 3 days (our original guest list was about 100 including families and plus ones). People have booked hotels, planes, trains, and are coming from other countries to be here. None of these people have done anything to us and would be getting caught in the crossfire if we were to elope instead.\\n\\nWould we be the arseholes?\\n\\nUpdate: I posted in the group chat I have with all 4 parents that someone has been screwing with the wedding, we've found the email they used and we'd be tracking the IP address to a device and location (this was all absolute bullshit, we don't even know how to find an IP address). As soon as I said we'd be tracking the email they all started pointing fingers and accusing each other. It looks like all 4 of them were in on it together. Still not sure what we're doing about the wedding but all 4 parents are uninvited.\\n\\nWe're thinking that we might elope for the ceremony and then have the reception as planned (it's all the same party\\/venue and we won't get money back) because of the number of people who are coming from all over the place.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUPDATE 2: My mother made up the email and her mother helped re-plan the wedding. We knew they'd been meeting for lunch but we didn't realise what they were doing in that time. Caterer and baker can fix the menu and cake, and the clothing is all safe. Venue think they might be able to fix the decorations and the parents have paid for the changes.\\n\\nThe ceremony itself is the same (we were worried it had been changed from a non religious ceremony to a religious one but it hadn't) so we'll probably just go through with the day as it currently stands, with a couple changes.\\n\\nWe've decided that we will meet up before the ceremony with some close friends (no parents) to sign the certificate so we're not doing it surrounded by strangers, then have the ceremony and rings as planned with everyone invited, go to the reception with everyone who has been invited because innocent people have paid out money to be here, and then afterwards we will go for drinks with the people who were at the signing earlier in the day.\\n\\nThe venue offered us security, but we're not going to uninvite the additional people or turn them away, and as for our parents, we're not sure. The options are either invite them and let them deal with their invitees so we don't have to, then cut them out of speeches and just don't acknowledge them all day and after the reception cut contact, or just don't let them come, in which case we will need the security the venue offered because I can't see them just not going.\\n\\nVenue have also said to pretty much just leave it with them, they'll put what they can back to what we'd planned and they're prepared to offer a partial refund based on what they can't fix (so if they fix 50% of it, they're prepared to refund 25% for the 50% they can't fix)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**FINAL UPDATE:**\\n\\n**We had a small private thing where we signed the certificate with our closest friends, then we went to the planned ceremony and had a short service where we exchanged rings, followed by a reception.**\\n\\n**We told the parents that they were not invited, told the venue they weren't invited, the venue put what was essentially a bouncer at the door, and they still got in. They don't seem to understand what they did wrong as they boasted to their guests that \\\"they planned this, but we changed it to what you're currently seeing\\\" and their own guests ended up being the ones to tell them how fucked up that was. They were pretty much shamed by their guests into leaving about an hour after they arrived. Also, half their guests didn't show, it was probably about 60-70% our guests in the end, and we definitely had the majority. Food (including cake) was sorted out but not decor, and venue are refunding us 50%, which was going to be 30%, but then they let the parents in.**\\n\\n**We only spoke to them once to tell them that because after completely fucking up our wedding plans they then couldn't honour one simple request to not come, they would not be hearing from us, potentially ever again, and if they contacted us that would change to definitely never hearing from us again.**\\n\\n**We are currently in the cab on our way to get drinks with the same friends who were at the signing earlier and then off on our honeymoon.**\"},{\"index\":795,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I am an after school tutor.

I'm 26F, he is 27M and we have been together for 8 years. \\n\\nI was in a bad car wreck a few months ago after getting T-Boned by a Semi. Because of this I got a check for almost $19k, as well as a brand new vehicle. I practically begged my boyfriend multiple times not to tell anyone we received the money because both of our families suck and like to mooch off of us, even though we are the ones struggling financially and we are the ONLY ones who lost our jobs to Covid. We got laid off within a week of eachother and were both denied for unemployment. So it's been rough. \\n\\nI received the check from the accident 3 days ago. He instantly went and paid $100 to his sister that we owed her and apparently she asked where he got money and despite me telling him not to, he told her I had gotten my check. He instantly told me about it and said that he felt \\\"cornered\\\". His sister has that affect on people so I tried to push it out of my mind even though I was peeved. \\n\\nSince that point I have gotten phone calls from all 3 of his brothers, his 2 sisters and even his uncle who I have never even met, due to him living out of state. All of them were asking for money. I hold true to my restrictions and didnt allow anyone to borrow anything because I know they will NOT pay me back and I have more important shit to do with my money (pay bills, rent, pay off my car loan and student debt and put away a big chunk so I can save for a home). \\n\\nThe final straw was this morning. I wake up to a call from an unknown number at around 530am and it's his father. Hes like \\\"Hey Champ, how you doing? How are you recovering?\\\" So I gave him the run down. Well, before he hangs up he says \\\"So Julie (my boyfriends sister) told me you got your money. Peter (his step son) turns 5 today and I didnt get my paycheck and I'm fighting with payroll about it. Can you spot me $500?\\\" I instantly hung up and confronted my boyfriend about it.\\n\\nI told him my basic requests were ignored and that I felt disrespected and that I didnt want people knowing for this exact reason. He told me I was blowing it out of proportion and that I could simply tell them no. I explained that that was besides the point and that I wanted to avoid having to turn people away left and right. He still thinks I'm overreacting. \\n\\nSo now I am at a loss where a part of me wants to cut access to my check from him entirely since he cant even follow basic requests. Hes not spending the money or anything like that, especially without asking first but the fact that he told people after I practically begged him not to sits really heavy on me. A part of me knows he is right and that I could just say no but I dont want to have to do that. WIBTA if I cut off his access to this money?\\n\\nEDIT: I truly did not expect this to blow up the way that it did!

This is my money, not his families, and some shit is on a need to know basis. This is not something they needed to know, period. Secondly, no, him keeping this information isnt something that would have made him uncomfortable. He has no problem withholding this sort of info from my family but when it comes to his own, it's a complete double standard. This has also happened in the past with my tax return money as well, which coincidentally I happened to be conned out of nearly $8k by the same sister in question. She never paid us back. This is also the same family that saw that I needed a place to stay while getting my new home situated and knowingly pushed all their Bill's on me, resulting in me being $1200 in the hole by the time I left their house.

But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven\\u2019t said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.\\n\\nI still own the same house as then and I\\u2019ve pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it\\u2019s kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can\\u2019t really explain the logic behind it because I don\\u2019t think there is any. It just doesn\\u2019t feel right to change her room.\\n\\nThis has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there\\u2019s my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it\\u2019s just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It\\u2019s therapeutic in some weird way.\\n\\nMy wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. \\n\\nWe\\u2019re now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn\\u2019t an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.\\n\\n She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.\\n\\nWhen she said these things I was really hurt. But I\\u2019ve had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It\\u2019s not fair to make my kids share a room because I won\\u2019t let go of the past. It\\u2019s not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn\\u2019t my first love. \\n\\nAITA?\"},{\"index\":495,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My fiance and I are getting married in June next year. We're both vegans, and although we don't judge those who are not vegan, we wanted to serve vegan food at our wedding. We found a vegan caterer.\\n\\nWhen we sent out invitations, we added a note saying that the food will be vegan. We also asked that everyone who has any specific dietary requirements let us know. The note made it clear that anyone who needed a specific diet would be catered for. \\n\\nSoon after the invitations went out, my aunt phoned us in a huff. My uncle does not want vegan food; he needs to eat meat, she said. I asked what his dietary requirements are, thinking that he has a specific medical condition and cannot eat a vegan meal. She said his reasons are \\\"cultural\\\" and he must eat meat. I said that's not really a good enough reason, we all come from the same culture and it's not like it's a sin to not eat meat with every single meal. \\n\\nI explained to her that I wouldn't really mind him eating meat but 1) it means I'll have to bring in a new caterer for one meal, which will be expensive and 2) I don't want to pay for meat if I don't have to. Again, I'm not judging non-vegans, but it doesn't sit right with me. \\n\\nWeeks went by. The only people who had dietary requirements were three cousins, who eat a low-carb diet. My vegan caterer came up with vegan, low-carb meals, and my cousins were happy with this plan. Upon hearing this, my aunt phoned me again, angrier this time, asking why my uncle can't be catered for because he \\\"doesn't like\\\" vegan food.\\n\\nI refused again. I told her that the food consists of things I KNOW he eats anyway: vegetables, coconut, nuts, etc. I went through a list of ingredients I knew would be in the food and she admitted he has no intolerances\\/allergies to any of that stuff. What's the big deal with him skipping meat one time? I told her that if he's so adamant about the meat he can buy himself McDonalds and eat it at the kiddy table.\\n\\nNow my aunt isn't talking to me, and is instead talking shit about me to all my family members. I told her that they are welcome to simply not attend the wedding if they're going to bitch about the food.\\n\\nI understand that veganism is not possible or sustainable for many people in the long-term but come on - it's ONE meal, that is FREE. \\n\\nAITA?

It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'\\n\\nSo the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \\\"How do you pronounce that?\\\" It's Tina!\\n\\nI have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \\\"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\\\" to lighthearted, \\\"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\\\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \\\"Thanks Tiana!\\\" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\\n\\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana\\n\\nTina: No problem, Chad!\\n\\nJessica: Hi Tiara!\\n\\nTina: Good morning, Jennifer!\\n\\nWould I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\\n\\nEDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:\\n\\nA lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!\\n\\nA lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.\\n\\nA lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!\\n\\nAnd finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.\\n\\nEDIT #2:\\n\\nNo, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced\\/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or \\\"Tiara\\\"\\n\\nNo, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.\\n\\nNo, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!\\n\\nYes, I correct them every time.\\n\\nNo, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!\\n\\nResponding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance).

Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.\\n\\nSome friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.\\n\\nI was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened.

There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.\\n\\nSo, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, \\\"Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?\\\" To which I replied, \\\"Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high.\\\" She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm. \\n\\nI came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure.

My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.\\n\\nWeeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.\\n\\nSince then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that.

He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole.

I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change.\\n\\n1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.\\n2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.\\n3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.\\n4. Online he announced that I \\\"pushed out a dark skinned baby\\\" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.\\n5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.\\n6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a \\\"Welfare Princess,\\\" and how I was going to be just another \\\"baby mama.\\\"\\n7. Just to clarify. Jim is \\\"white\\\" and I am at least half white.

My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.\\n\\nI do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.\\n\\nThis was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before.

Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn\\u2019t a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.\\n\\nAs for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box \\u2018room\\u2019 filled with something you\\u2019re terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. \\n\\nI thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I\\u2019m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn\\u2019t care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I\\u2019ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it\\u2019s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I\\u2019d fail if I was put in a room with it. \\n\\nWhen I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can\\u2019t lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.\\n\\nI did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.\\n\\nNow, I won a pretty average car which I didn\\u2019t particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.\\n\\nI told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.\\n\\nI\\u2019m obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.\"},{\"index\":198,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My 7 year old daughter\\u2019s doing virtual school in our living room recently.

So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn\\u2019t really expecting that. \\n\\nI asked him why. He said that he didn\\u2019t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn\\u2019t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn\\u2019t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn\\u2019t want anyone to see him with the pads because they\\u2019d think he was a \\u201ctr***y\\u201d. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn\\u2019t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I\\u2019ve been thinking that maybe I might\\u2019ve pushed it too far.\\n\\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?\\n\\n*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I\\u2019m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we\\u2019ll see how it goes*\\n\\n**UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn\\u2019t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn\\u2019t feel like he had to, and that I could\\u2019ve \\u201cheld it in\\u201d and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can\\u2019t \\u201chold in\\u201d menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could\\u2019ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn\\u2019t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. \\n\\nI asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he\\u2019d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn\\u2019t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I\\u2019d need help is if I was a \\u201ccripple\\u201d. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn\\u2019t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. \\n\\nI can\\u2019t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can\\u2019t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month\\u2019s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I\\u2019m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I\\u2019m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages.

I (31F) and my husband tried for 5 years to get pregnant. Testing eventually revealed I have eggs of fucking steel and without medical help I'll never get pregnant. So that's what we did. Gave our samples, one petri dish and 9 months later I have 2 beautiful fraternal twin boys. Jack and Adam (fake).\\n\\nThing is Jake has a condition. Without going into detail, requires a shot once a week. Once he is older he can take pills. I went back to work and MIL offered to watch the babes (shes wonderful, I trust her 100%. They were 9months.. Now 16months) during this time she would give his injection as we had a schedule. 10am before snack and nap. Worked very well until a month ago when she gave the shot to the wrong kid. Now they may be fraternal but they look identical. I'll be honest my husband and I even mix them up sometimes. Everyone does. She immediately noticed her mistake called 911 and they were transferred to hospital. By the time I got there Adam had been given the reversal agent and they were both happily sipping on juice loving the attention. We went home the same night told to push fluids. He was never in danger. Its a very slow acting medication that, at worst, would have given him diarrhea in a few days. MIL was beside herself. I tried to ease her worry but she refused to babysit so to daycare they went. \\n\\nThis daycare has a nurse cause some of the kids have medications so she new what to do but the worry of mixing up the kids was a valid concern (and they would NOT keep name tags on) Doctor recommended a medical tattoo. Explained they tattoo a freckle, no bigger then the end of a pencil eraser, on an area of skin that's easily seen while the child is under mild sedation similar to dental offices. Because of the area it usually fades in 2-3yrs but by then they should have developed more personal features and may not need it redone. So after discussion with my husband we did it. \\n\\nHe has a 2mm brown freckle on his earlobe.  From entering the office to leaving it took 30 minutes. Never felt a thing.\\n\\nMIL lost her shit the second I mentioned a medical tattoo. I tried to explain but she just freaked out so I put both kids on the floor and told her to pick up Jack and find the tattoo. She picked up Adam So I handed her Jack and after 20 minutes still couldn't find it. Stripped him to his skivvies. I finally pointed it out and she went \\\"That's just a freckle\\\"  I just said... \\\"My point exactly. Adam doesn't have a freckle there.. So that's how daycare can tell them apart\\\"\\n\\nShe's still pissed and ranting. Once I explain to others and they fail to find it they understand but they still think I went to far in tattooing my child and altering their body. I believe I took the necessary precautions recommended by the doctor and the tattoo will fade with sun exposure and as he grows. By the time he's 5 it probably won't even be visible or it'll just look like a faded freckle. So..

But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it.

However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. \\n\\nI was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.\\n\\nAfter talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded.

As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was \\\"fair\\\" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.\\n\\nThis obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself.

My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate.\\n\\nHowever, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks.\\n\\nBut, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate); like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.\\n\\nShe got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this haha! Thank you for the comments and messages! While some of you have labeled me as the asshole, I think a lot of you are saying that I am not which is good to hear. But, I want to stress that I don't think my daughter is really the asshole (a little right now) but she is the sweetest little girl in the world (I might be biased haha). She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.\\n\\nSome of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body; she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into \\\"streetwear.\\\" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?\\n\\nI think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances; so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.\\n\\nThat being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.\\n\\nParenting is hard, and I was always a girly-girl and so were all the people around me, so this uncharted territory for me.

One thing I\\u2019ve always done is build him toys and furniture. It was a way of providing without the awkwardness of handing over cash. Also, between my late brothers cash and life insurance via work a trust was setup for my nephew for ~\\u00a3500,000. He wasn\\u2019t actually married to my SIL.\\n\\nNow via the lab at work I\\u2019ve made him a lot of wooden or 3d printed toys, but also some simple handmade electronic toys.

I was attending my nephews third birthday and I turned up the night before to assemble his present. It was a small climbing frame\\/Swing set I had watched better carpenters than me in the lab make.\\n\\nThe new husband was a little standoffish but come the day of the party he was telling anyone who listened that I didn\\u2019t pay or make the present I had lackies at work do it for free. This culminated in him calling all my \\u201cpresents\\u201d an embarrassment and given my fancy job I could afford to splash some cash.\\n\\nI confronted him and my former SIL and she basically confirmed that whilst the presents were appreciated she honestly expected more direct support from me after my brothers death.

I retorted that it was for my nephew and good luck accessing it for that because the trust requires my signature to pay out.\\n\\nI wasn\\u2019t even home before he was calling me to apologise, clearly unaware I held the reigns to my late brothers money. The apology was insincere and I asked to speak to my former SIL where I confirmed again I wouldn\\u2019t be manufacturing her anything.

I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don\\u2019t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \\n\\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we\\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\\u2019ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \\n\\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\\u2019t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \\n\\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here\\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\\u2019t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn\\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn\\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\\u2019t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \\n\\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\\u2019ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEDIT for added info: \\n\\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are\\/were autistic. There\\u2019s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \\n\\n1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad\\u2019s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I\\u2019m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he\\u2019s the generation after mine in our family tree and it\\u2019s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it\\u2019s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don\\u2019t care, and my family\\u2019s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it\\u2019s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don\\u2019t know how after this situation). \\n\\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he\\u2019s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son\\u2019s safety. I didn\\u2019t know how he would react and followed my cousin\\u2019s lead, but wasn\\u2019t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \\n\\n3. I don\\u2019t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don\\u2019t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we\\u2019ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.\"},{\"index\":268,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My (42M) niece (17F) recently confided in me that she is a lesbian.

For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. \\n\\nAbout six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on \\\"proper\\\" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. \\n\\nSo the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \\\"starting to get annoying\\\". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \\\"skulking around all the time\\\". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \\\"getting ridiculous\\\". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\\n\\nMy potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?\\n\\nETA: some questions people keep asking: \\n1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying\\/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and \\\"just do\\\". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. \\n2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) \\n3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too.

Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of \\\"oh well if you are not using it i will\\\". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after.

I didn\\u2019t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn\\u2019t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he\\u2019s 22).\\n\\nMy family told me I\\u2019m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it\\u2019s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?\\n\\nINFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn\\u2019t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn\\u2019t contact me. I didn\\u2019t contact them. I needed a break.\\n\\nEdit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he\\u2019s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. \\n\\nI never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. \\n\\nI told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son\\u2019s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this \\u201cAdam, you haven\\u2019t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn\\u2019t sit well with me. That\\u2019s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I\\u2019m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.\\u201d Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. \\n\\nHe was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex\\u2019s affair. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s the real reason he\\u2019s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.\"},{\"index\":263,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"This happened on Halloween and the day following.\\nMy neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. \\n\\nMy apartment complex didn\\u2019t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.\\n\\nResidents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios\\/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional \\u201cknock on door, physically hand strangers candy\\u201d was not permitted.\\n\\nSo, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn\\u2019t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.\\n\\nThe next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded \\u201cnope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night\\u201d \\nI was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.\\n\\nShe said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a \\u201ctax.\\u201d\\n\\nHer son then chimes in and said \\u201cyou only took two bags from us!\\u201d \\nshe responded with \\u201cbut I\\u2019m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax\\u201d \\n\\nI was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said \\u201chey, aren\\u2019t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. \\u201c\\n\\nI explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.\\n\\nShe was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. \\n\\nNow she\\u2019s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won\\u2019t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.\\n\\nMy husband thinks I\\u2019m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn\\u2019t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.\\n\\nEdit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn\\u2019t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. \\n\\nAs for the authenticity of her vegansim- \\nI may have exaggerated when I said \\u201csuper vegan\\u201d when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it\\u2019s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan \\u201clifestyle\\u201d if that makes sense. \\n\\nNow for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it\\u2019s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can\\u2019t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.\\n\\nI think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can\\u2019t be vegan and not know these things. I\\u2019m not vegan, I\\u2019m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. \\n\\nAbout the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! ;)\\n\\nEDIT #2 \\nI cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren\\u2019t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn\\u2019t have told me what was actually wrong. \\nTurns out he was calling me an asshole cause she\\u2019s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven\\u2019t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I\\u2019m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn\\u2019t stop. \\n\\nI also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol.\"},{\"index\":264,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"Ok.

My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.\\n2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.\\n3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.\\n4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.\\n5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.\\n6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.\\n7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.\\n\\nEdit 2\\n\\nIn retrospective and after reading some comments, they really need therapy.

We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \\n\\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \\\"Einstein\\\" once and John interrupted him to say, \\\"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\\\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \\\"I love college football!\\\", and he replied to my story with \\\"It's called gridiron you moron\\\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \\n\\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \\\"I'm a Biomed Engineer\\\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\\n\\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \\\"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\\\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \\n\\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \\\"damn M0shka you famous now\\\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \\\"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\\\" \\n\\n\\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3\\/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5\\/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \\n\\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \\\"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\\\". To which he got angry again and said, \\\"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\\\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \\n\\nThat's it. I fucking lost it.

He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.\\n\\nHe never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death.

I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.\\n\\nSo I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. \\n\\nAnd she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.\\n\\nI said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. \\n\\nHer husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.\\n\\nI was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.\\n\\nMy mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.\\n\\nAITA for giving that number?\"},{\"index\":51,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My (17F) sister (34F) called me saying that her work had an emergency and she needs to get there ASAP and needed me to watch her kids because \\u201cno one else can\\u201d.

Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities\\/phone\\/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.\\n\\nMe: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?\\n\\nMy Mom: Nothing.\\n\\nA long ass pause.\\n\\nMe: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?\\n\\nMy Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!\\n\\nMy dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities\\/phone\\/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.\\n\\nSo later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.\\n\\nThe conversation ended with this:\\n\\nSister: **FUCK YOU.

It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. \\n\\nYesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. \\n\\nBrenda messages the group saying \\\"maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts\\\" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. \\n\\nMe: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol\\n\\nBrenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship.

Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.\\n\\nEdit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying \\\"sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners.

Right after we broke up I found out I was pregnant and now I\\u2019m at 24 weeks. I let him know and he was ecstatic. Turns out his girlfriend had fertility issues and would likely never be able to get pregnant naturally and he has always wanted to be a father. Getting back together was out of the question for both of us so he\\u2019s still with his girlfriend. \\n\\nJoe was only allowed at the initial appointment because of COVID-19 and we found out I was having twins. According to Joe when he told Kim she had a mental breakdown about her infertility, and wanted to talk to me. I met them at their house and Kim stated that she wanted to be involved in my pregnancy because she would eventually be the children\\u2019s stepmother. She started telling me that I needed to do a home birth, that I needed to formula feed so that they could have the babies half of the week, that she wanted one boy and one girl, and that she wanted the kid to call her Mama since they would be calling me Mommy. I shut her down and said I would make the best choices for my children and my body and left. \\n\\nKim continued to be overbearing and texting me everyday about my eating habits, exercise habits, and bitching about how her job wouldn\\u2019t let her take maternity leave. At the virtual genetics counseling appointment, she attended instead of Joe and took over the whole meeting trying to talk about her family history which wasn\\u2019t relevant. When it came time for my 20 week level 2 scan, they allowed me one guest and Joe suggested I take Kim instead of him, which I refused to do. Joe did end up coming and he found out the gender because I wanted to keep it a surprise for me so we could throw a gender reveal party. I put a pregnancy announcement on my social media and then she put up an announcement saying they were expecting twins \\u201cthe non-traditional way\\u201d and how blessed she was. I was irritated but I kept my mouth shut. Then she threw a gender reveal party and posted it on social media. I wasn\\u2019t even invited. She also announced that she\\u2019s having a baby shower. I commented on her posts and told her to stop treating me like a surrogate, that the kids weren\\u2019t hers, and that Joe didn\\u2019t have any claim or custody of the kids until they are born. I then called Joe and reiterated all of this and stated that I would not be seeing either of them until we went to family court and that my mother would be my birthing partner. He and Kim and some of her friends and family are saying I\\u2019m an asshole and her mother even called and insisted I give her one of my babies like this is the Parent Trap? So AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: I\\u2019m definitely getting a lawyer ASAP. Y\\u2019all have scared the shit out of me but I\\u2019m happy you did.\\n\\nUPDATE: I never considered that this could\\u2019ve happened on purpose. We used condoms because I do not react well to hormonal birth control and I had to wait to get a non-hormonal IUD because of other medical issues. The Thursday I posted this, I went to the police and they stated that there was nothing they could do because a crime hadn\\u2019t been committed. In my state orders of protection are criminal or family so I was able to get one against Joe. On Friday, I did get a lawyer and they let me know in my state there was nothing I could do as far as custody before the babies are born, so I will be leaving my state soon to ensure that this isn\\u2019t my babies home state and I can\\u2019t be charged with anything. \\nHowever, someone sent this post to Kim and she came to my job, damaged my car, and broke a bunch of office windows. I work with kids so she was arrested for not just the criminal damage and trespassing but also child endangerment so hopefully that works in my favor. Also if Joe did it on purpose, I don\\u2019t think Kim knew, because she was screaming at me about how I stole her life and everything I had was supposed to be hers.\\n\\nUpdate: I have orders of protection against both Kim and Joe. I left the state anyway and Joe and Kim started harassing me again because there\\u2019s no legal jurisdiction when you leave the state, but I have enough evidence that I was able to press charges in my current state as well and will be pursuing a restraining order here.\"},{\"index\":58,\"label\":0,\"text\":\" Previous Post: [https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/AmItheAsshole\\/comments\\/e1oy5c\\/aita\\\\_if\\\\_i\\\\_cancel\\\\_christmas\\\\_because\\\\_i\\\\_cant\\\\_afford\\/](https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/AmItheAsshole\\/comments\\/e1oy5c\\/aita_if_i_cancel_christmas_because_i_cant_afford\\/) \\n\\nSo, it's been 2 weeks and somehow the messages are still coming in.

She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.\\n\\nSince my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends\\/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).\\n\\nInspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!\\n\\nThank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.

I truly have no issue with this as the housing market is terrible for buyers so more power to them for being home owners. I recently, unfortunately inherited my parents house, which is 3 bedroom, out in the sticks. \\n\\nThe issue: We went appliance shopping because most of the the stuff in the house was 10-15 years old. We were standing with an employee who I had asked to recommend some smaller items like toasters and kettles when the employee asked if I was moving out as general chit chat. I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a \\\"what was that\\\" face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying \\\"Yeah, *I* purchased my house\\\". I asked \\\"does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues.\\\" She grinned and said \\\"it's just for the record\\\" which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied \\\"Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you.\\\" The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop.

My parents often had 'friends' over in the house. I didn't know they were polyamorous ofc. One day I was outside playing, got hurt and when I ran inside caught my parents  making out with some random guy. They told me they have other adults that they love and it's a completely normal thing. Me being a child just accepted that.\\n\\nThey gave up being secretive and their 'partners' would constantly be around, even joining on outings. I remember that on my 10th birthday they invited 3 of their partners, one of who I'd never seen before, and for the rest of the day my parents just withdrew from my party and hung out with them. I never saw them doing anything explicit again but they would kiss their partners, hug them make flirty comments, something that would be normal between parents but with many more people. Sometimes I came home from school and my parents were gone and there was some random adult in our house, some of them seemed surprised that my parents even had a child. \\n\\nI always hated it, but since my parents had told me this was normal, I assumed many adults probably did similar things and that it's just an adult thing all kids hate. Later they had less partners and eventually seemed to stop. Not that I'd know for sure bc I moved out with 17. I didn't think about it anymore. A year ago I started therapy (other reasons). As usual the topic of my upbringing came up and it brought back many feelings I wasn't aware of. I realised that although my parents were always good to me, I had never really felt close to any of them and still have a lot of resentment that they made me feel like I had to compete for my parent's attention with random strangers. \\n\\nA while ago, I visited them and they told me they are going to take part in a documentary about polyamorous families and that the producers would like to include interviews with the children, so they would love if I could agree and tell everyone that polyamory 'doesn't mess kids up'. All my resentment bubbled up and I said that I cannot agree because I would not be able to say anything positive. My parents looked shocked (I had never brought this up before) and asked why, and I unloaded all, that I always felt pushed aside, we barely had any family time without strangers intruding, it turned into an argument and I became loud and yelled that the truth is it did fuck me up and they shouldn't have had a child if their number one priority was fucking the whole world. My mother cried and my father said I should probably leave. So I left and was shaken up for the rest of the week but also felt regret because I've never made my mum cry before. Later my father sent me a message that was like 'we are sorry you feel that way, can we have a calm discussion about this soon'.

Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his.

I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents.

I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nJust a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept.

There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read.

Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\---------------------------------------------\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBack in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSince my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating \\\"mistakes can happen.\\\" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it.

She requires attention almost 24\\/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlong with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents \\\"expect\\\" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was \\\"grounded\\\" because i turned my phone off in the theater.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me.

While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down.

I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue.

I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump\\/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\\n\\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\\n\\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\\n\\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

My son (13M)  loudly says, \\u201cMake sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!\\u201d as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. \\n\\nI told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. \\n\\nThat night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this.

This year my 14 y\\/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm.

She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\\u2019s not YOUR pan. \\n\\nShe asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her.

They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn\\u2019t allowed to apply for college.\\n\\nI did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn\\u2019t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought \\u201cthem\\u201d for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle.\\n\\nMy parents and I have barely spoken for years. I\\u2019m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were \\u201csorry if they caused me pain\\u201d but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn\\u2019t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn\\u2019t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn\\u2019t being serious and I just left. Since then, I\\u2019ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I\\u2019m being immature and hurtful.

I've gotten along with her family (MIL, BIL, SIL), but I always felt like her FIL and other SIL (Sarah) never liked me.\\n\\nI'm a professionally trained chef with 15+ years of experience and I work at a high-end Chinese restaurant (a spin-off of a popular one in Beijing) in a large US city. My crew and I have won several awards, and I've been explicitly told I'll be the next executive chef. Sarah is also a professionally trained chef and works at a popular upscale French restaurant in the city. She constantly brags about it and (no joke) compares herself out loud to Ramsay and Bourdain.\\n\\nWhenever I'm at my MIL and FIL's house and helping out in the kitchen, Sarah is *always* criticizing everything I do. Whether it's chopping, braising, marinating, etc., she always butts in with comments like \\\"Umm, I think you should actually do X like this...\\\". I've been patient for my wife and side stepping those comments, saying things like \\\"Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the way I do it.\\\"\\n\\nThings came to a head two weeks ago when my wife, FIL, MIL, and I were in her parent's kitchen prepping dinner for my MIL's birthday. We were running a bit behind so things were heated (which I kind of like because it reminded me of work) and that's when Sarah walked in. She took one look at what I was doing, scoffed, and said something like \\\"Oh wow, okay, so that's not the right way of doing things\\\". It hit a nerve and I pretty sternly told her to stop criticizing my cooking and that I'm also a chef like her. She laughed and said \\\"making Kung Pao chicken at some Chinese restaurant doesn't count\\\". The kitchen went silent, FIL snorted\\/chuckled, and my MIL yelled \\\"SARAH WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU\\\". I stopped what I was doing, swore at her and called her \\\"a racist piece of shit\\\", apologized to my MIL for not being able to stay, and left for home with my wife.\\n\\nApparently this caused a massive fight after we left, with my MIL\\/BIL\\/other SIL taking my side and my FIL\\/Sarah saying \\\"it was a joke but kind of true\\\" and that I was \\\"being too sensitive\\\". The extended family somehow got wind of this and now everyone is arguing and taking sides, with my wife even getting texts from some her cousins apologizing for Sarah's behavior. Despite being on my side, my wife is begging me to apologize so that the fighting will stop but I refuse to because fuck Sarah and her blatant racism.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n**TL;DR:** I'm a chef working at upscale Chinese resto, my SIL is a chef at upscale French resto. She's critical of my cooking skills and has now called it \\\"making Kung Pao chicken at a Chinese restaurant\\\". Family at war, wife begging me to apologize, what do?\\n\\n**EDIT:** My wife has also informed me that now Sarah may be in trouble at work and she's blaming me for it. Apparently one of her co-workers heard her rant about what happened and reported it to management. (Edit: To clarify Sarah is blaming me, though my wife is partly blaming me)\\n\\n**EDIT2\\/UPDATE:** So it looks like one of my wife's cousins found this post and put it on Sarah's Facebook wall going \\\"This is you right?...\\\". Her FB friends are starting to comment with things like \\\"If this is you Sarah then I'm disappointed\\\". I think Sarah's still at work - shit might be hitting the fan soon and now my wife is pissed too.

Officially going to keep this post up and if you're still reading this Doug - I'm very disappointed in you, you're better than this. Will also continue to update and thanks again for all your support folks\\n\\n**EDIT4\\/UPDATE3:**  *Lots of stuff just went down*\\n\\n1. My wife got a call from SIL. (From wife's paraphrasing) Sarah started screaming\\/crying at her the moment my wife picked up and said that she just got demoted because of \\\"[her] {Asian slur} husband\\\". Apparently some of her co-workers have her on FB and showed the post to management, which combined with her earlier rant, double whammied her back to being a line cook and now she might get fired. My wife told her to go fuck herself and is now solidly on my side after taking the verbal abuse from Sarah and reading some of the comments here. My wife is still the opposite of happy though...\\n2. Wife called MIL and asked her WTF was going on with FIL. MIL was confused so my wife played back the voicemail I had on my phone and apparently my MIL literally just walked away from the phone without hanging up and started screaming at FIL.\\n3. Facebook post has now devolved into a clusterfuck flame war with family and friends jumping in.\\n\\nSuffice to say, it has officialy gone nuclear\\n\\n[Me right now](https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/8QnGdHK.gifv)\\n\\nI think I'm going to have to call this a day, will make an update post when the dust settles.

You can edit this in, but we will not be allowing a standalone update on this.\\n\\n*I'd like to clarify that I got my wife and MIL's permissions to post this update (out respect for them and their privacy)*\\n\\nSuffice to say, it's been kind of nuts this past week. My wife and I had to turn off social media for a bit because of the shitstorm caused by her cousin putting my last post on Sarah's Facebook page. Some people even tried to call the restaurant I work at to get me fired as retribution, but luckily everyone there is 100% on my side (or as my boss put it \\\"Fuck [Sarah], fuck those racists, fuck them so goddamn much\\\"). I guess it didn't help them that half the calls involved threats, screaming, and more racial slurs.\\n\\nWe didn't hear any updates from her family, even though we assumed the shit met fan after MIL found out about FIL's threatening voicemail (*still disappointed in you Doug*). But that changed on Sunday night, when MIL suddenly showed up at our door with overnight bags. After we took a moment to help unpack and calm down, she spilled the beans on everything.\\n\\n\\n**FIL (aka Doug)**\\n\\nApparently my MIL and FIL were already having trouble in their marriage, and it was only made worse with a certain 2016 Presidential election (she's a Dem, and he had apparently gone more far-right since then). Seems that a line was crossed with the \\\"Kung Pao Incident\\\" and his voicemail. When he refused to apologize for anything (typical Doug), she asked for a divorce and he went beserk. She didn't feel safe there so that's when she came over (other BIL and SIL live out of town).\\n\\n\\n**Extended Family (aka The Great FB War of 2021)**\\n\\nYou may have been able to tell already, but the extended family was largely arguing\\/fighting\\/divided along political lines for a few years now and my cousin's FB post was likely just the light to set off the powder keg. According to my MIL, the fallout has allegedly already led to some break-ups, excommunication of some family members, and even an argument that ended with police involvement. Haven't verified this myself though.\\n\\n\\n**Sarah \\/ SIL**\\n\\nAccording to my MIL, Sarah came over to her place on Friday. The writing was on the wall and she was basically forced to quit. Despite her trying to start from scratch as a line cook, the entire staff turned against her. Nothing was coming back from the (dish) pit for her and she was getting the cold shoulder. She\\u2019s a great chef (I will admit this is true), but they took no chances since it turns out (shit you not)... they're partly owned by a Chinese investment company. Found this hard to believe and didn't want to add this detail, but it turned out to be true after some research (won't say any further for privacy). Word also got around in the local industry, and Sarah is essentially blacklisted from high-end establishments. She's now considering selling her home and moving to find work. As much as I don't like her and found her behavior horrifying, I didn't intend for this to happen so I've reached out to some buds in other states to see if they had any openings. Whether or not she wants to take itis up to her (and no, she has not apologized for anything either - but I still want to be a decent person to her).\\n\\n\\nIt sure as hell doesn't feel like a happy ending. Perhaps bittersweet justice, but that's all I can give you.

Not only that but apparently Carla said a couple years ago she was still in love with me when she was already dating Rick. Don\\u2019t have actual confirmation if that\\u2019s exactly what he was told. All Carla\\u2019s told me is that Rick was told about our past and he\\u2019s angry at her for never saying anything. \\n\\nIt became quite a drama and didnt hear from her for over a month until now. She told me they\\u2019re going to couples counseling and that the wedding is still on. But Rick requested that I not attend. It sucks but I totally get why he wouldn\\u2019t be comfortable. Then I asked the obvious question, where are they going to hold the wedding then? To my surprise she said they still want it at our place. \\n\\nRick said so to and in my mind I\\u2019m going \\u201che doesn\\u2019t want the guy who dated his fianc\\u00e9e  years ago at the wedding, but still wants the wedding at his house.\\u201d My wife and I are expected to just...not be at our home that weekend, And I told Carla no. They\\u2019re going to have to find some place else since we\\u2019re not going to simply leave our home to them for the weekend. Not only for safety reasons but it just doesn\\u2019t make sense. Rick doesn\\u2019t want me around because he\\u2019s not comfortable but is comfortable enough to have their wedding at my house? They really want their wedding here though and because of that I\\u2019ve been bugged by not only her but also Rick and some friends who think I\\u2019m being a petty asshole for not letting them have the wedding here anymore. Honestly don\\u2019t think that I am, it just doesn\\u2019t make sense at all to have to leave our own place for a wedding we\\u2019re no longer welcome to and leaving our home totally vulnerable.

I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts\\/uncles still have last century\\u2019s mind, and the younger portion, cousins\\/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.\\n\\nSo my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I\\u2019m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it\\u2019s kind of a secret, as he hasn\\u2019t told my family he is gay.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.\\n\\nBut he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won\\u2019t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn\\u2019t accept my brother being gay.\\n\\nAnyway, that\\u2019s his decision not mine, so for now he won\\u2019t say anything.\\n\\nUntil a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.\\n\\nIf it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don\\u2019t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don\\u2019t want to get the attention away from my fianc\\u00e9e, that\\u2019s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it\\u2019s a pretty good reason\\n\\nI asked him why my wedding day, he said it\\u2019s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can\\u2019t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. \\n\\nI didn\\u2019t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse\\n\\nWith a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.\\n\\nNext day I got a text and he said \\u201c dont worry, going alone\\u201d. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don\\u2019t seem to know what\\u2019s happening because they didn\\u2019t say anything.\\n\\nHe eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us\\n\\nThis is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?\\n\\nPS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!\\n\\nPS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!\\n\\nUpdate: spoke to fianc\\u00e9e, couldn\\u2019t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.\\n\\nClarification: I know it won\\u2019t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt\\/uncle. Doesn\\u2019t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don\\u2019t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother\\u2019s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING.

While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.\\n\\nI'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to \\\"Bob\\\" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.\\n\\nNow after I moved out, she started complaining how \\\"She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!\\\" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.\\n\\nAnyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: \\\"I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.\\\"\\n\\nI was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.\\n\\nMy sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.\\n\\nSo AITA here?\\n\\nEdit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.

Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'.

Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. \\n\\nSo here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. \\n\\nSo recently I was sick.

She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her.

She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far \\\"exotic\\\" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.\\n\\nCathy then jokes about how all this \\\"no travel business\\\" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was \\\"at a native speaker level\\\" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.\\n\\nI was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy \\\"oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!\\\" (\\\"oh fun, we have something in common then!\\\")\\n\\nShe immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she \\\"couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it.\\\" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.\\n\\nShe got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added \\\"which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!\\\" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said \\\"whatever\\\" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.\\n\\nHowever, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting \\\"superior\\\" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a \\\"little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues\\\" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace?

I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have \\\"witnesses\\\" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. \\n\\nEdit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an \\\"exotic\\\" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know \\\"exotic\\\" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. \\n\\nEdit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands.

I\\u2019m currently at 52kg and there\\u2019s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I\\u2019m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. \\n\\nMy friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She\\u2019s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I\\u2019m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. \\n\\nSarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they\\u2019re a physical feature I\\u2019m uncomfortable with but doesn\\u2019t let up. Examples of things she\\u2019ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they\\u2019ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she\\u2019ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my \\u2018cartoon boobs\\u2019. I know she\\u2019s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I\\u2019ve told her a few times to drop it before. \\n\\nNow we\\u2019re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *\\u2018Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you\\u2019re in a porno. We don\\u2019t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.\\u2019* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven\\u2019t spoken again. I\\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?\\n\\n\\n\\n**Edit:** I\\u2019m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah\\u2019s been telling everyone that it\\u2019s ME that\\u2019s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I\\u2019ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don\\u2019t even understand the stupid \\u2018boy body\\u2019 insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she\\u2019s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn\\u2019t sure at first but fuck it, I\\u2019m reporting her. I don\\u2019t know why I ever considered her a friend, she\\u2019s fucking mental and annoying.\\n\\n\\n**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn\\u2019t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn\\u2019t).\\n\\nI\\u2019ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn\\u2019t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don\\u2019t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I\\u2019ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I\\u2019m stupidly shy?)\\n\\nMy head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don\\u2019t know how it\\u2019s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.\\n\\n\\n**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I\\u2019ve seen:\\n\\n- I\\u2019ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I\\u2019m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.\\n\\n- My breasts alone aren\\u2019t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can\\u2019t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won\\u2019t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People\\u2019s comments don\\u2019t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.\\n\\n- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.\\n\\n- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.\\n\\n\\n**Update 2:**\\n\\nThe coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. \\n\\nI have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It\\u2019s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don\\u2019t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I\\u2019m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don\\u2019t directly work with one another but it doesn\\u2019t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn\\u2019t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don\\u2019t ever have to interact with one another, I\\u2019m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don\\u2019t care.\\n\\n\\n**Last Update:**\\n\\nI\\u2019m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I\\u2019ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don\\u2019t need this misery in my life. If she\\u2019s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. \\n\\nIf I don\\u2019t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.\"},{\"index\":146,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I\\u2019ve been a single dad since I was 18.

Jack basically thinks that lad points are important, he\\u2019s always going on about how many girls he\\u2019s been with and how high is body count is. I lived with him in a house share for a while and whenever he bought a girl home, he\\u2019d make sure to parade her around by introducing her, spend 15-20mins in his room having sex, then come out and strut around naked or in his boxers..yes he really would. I remember saying a few times why are you out here, you have a beautiful girl in your room and you\\u2019re not in there with her?\\n\\nThis behaviour was pretty common for him and even though he was an almighty douche, we were still friends. Anyway after about 8 months of living together, after a drunken night, me and Jack ended up in bed together. Honestly it was terrible and having slept with him I realised something. Jack had a big dick (which I knew because of his strutting) but he thought that having a big dick automatically meant he was good at sex. Like it just immediately made him amazing in bed. Our sex was shit, like hands down the worst sex I\\u2019d ever had. No foreplay, he left lights and tv on, then unceremoniously shoved himself inside me. The whole thing was basically a race for him to get inside me as quickly as possible. Maybe 10 minutes of uncomfortable jackhammering then he was done. The next morning I was really sore because 1. I wasn\\u2019t wet at all 2. His dick was big. But because I was sore he took that as him doing a bang up job. Anyway that experience was a few years ago, and even after all this time, Jack is still the same lad he was and still fucks girls like they\\u2019re lined up on a conveyor belt for him. \\n\\nBack to the present. Recently, my husband and I hosted a bbq in our garden as gatherings are now allowed. Jack came over as he\\u2019s in our mutuals group. Of course after a while Jack starts going on about the girls he\\u2019s fucked, and even showing up another girl at the party by telling people he\\u2019d fucked her. It\\u2019s then he turns to me and asks if I can prove to the lads how \\u201cfire\\u201d he is at sex. Slightly embarrassed but also angry he even mentioned me, I straight up told him he was shit. Basically worst sex I ever had, I then went onto say what happened and that he only has sex just to say that he\\u2019s had sex. It wasn\\u2019t fun, pleasurable or enjoyable and for the record I didn\\u2019t come. Amazingly enough, two other girls also backed up what I was saying. Saying their nights with him were pretty much the same to how I described it. Jack got defensive and angry but we wouldn\\u2019t drop it. He eventually left absolutely fuming. \\n\\nMy husband, who knows I slept with him years before said I was insensitive, especially as it seems jack relies heavily on the lad\\/sex God persona he\\u2019s created. I don\\u2019t think so, it was about time Jack was called out for being shit in bed and maybe use this to learn how to actually have sex.  All the boys in the group think I\\u2019m an ass for calling Jack out, me and the girls disagree.\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: - Holy cow this got way more attention than I thought it would! Thanks for all the comments.l and thank you kind strangers for the awards!!\\n\\nShould clear a few things up. A lot of people asking why I was or am friends with Jack. I was back then, because honestly at times he was a decent guy, just blanketed by a douchey exterior. After I moved out of the house, we fell out of close contact but are still hovering in mutual friend circles. I\\u2019m not directly friends with him now but he\\u2019s still a friend of a friend and we are normally civil.\\n\\nEDIT #2: I really don\\u2019t get why people are misunderstanding the story. For the record I did not cheat on my husband. Jack and I had a one night stand together years ago while we were at uni. I wouldn\\u2019t consider him my friend now but we still have mutuals from different social circles and we do occasionally still see one another.\\n\\nINFO: Basically my friend group (close\\/mutual\\/extended) all knew or knew of each other at uni. I\\u2019m British and now live in the states. I attended Uni between the ages of 18 - 21. At 19 I went to the states for a year abroad, and the sister Uni is where I met my now husband. Jack is American and was an international student doing exchange, I was first year he was second year. I, a first year, ended up living with Jack because I decided to go to uni last minute, and as Halls were full, ended up responding to a house share ad (a lot of students drop out after making a house share commitment so these ads are common)\\n\\nI actually met my husband (also American) through Jack, as Jack was one of my only known contacts when I moved to the states. (My British uni and his American uni were linked) I met my husband a year AFTER I slept with Jack. I could not possibly have had any idea that my housemate and one night stand would go on to introduce me to my future husband. My husband knew Jack and I slept together because unfunnily enough, Jack brought it upon our first meeting.\\n\\nLiving together, Jack and I mainly bonded over weed and raves, and although he was sometimes somewhat decent, looking back I\\u2019m disgusted at our so called friendship. I could write an essay on how he treated me.\\n\\n\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/user\\/Lucky-Crow\\/comments\\/h7wjd9\\/in_regards_to_my_aita_post\\/ &gt; If anyone is interested in an update, I posted it here.\"},{\"index\":154,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit.

Fine with me.\\n\\nWe started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?).

Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said \\\"well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.\\\"\\n\\nIf things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go.

I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\\\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \\\"struggling with my weight\\\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \\\"way too skinny to be healthy.\\\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \\\"look like a man's.\\\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\\n\\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \\n\\nFinally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \\\"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\\\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \\n\\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize.

He's one of those types who harbors the believe that have a dick makes him superior to women.

A little while later though the husband began asking if he could dogsit sometime bring Onyx to their place for a sleepover. I said no and explained AGAIN that Onyx is a service dog and I needed him to ya know...... Stay alive. Her husband got an attitude and told me Onyx wasn't a machine and I had no right to deprive him of fun. Then he pulled the I'm a man so I know more than you card by explaining that I was wrong and he was right and I could go one night without onyx and control my seizures. All this time my friend sat on the couch saying nothing. \\n\\nI asked him to leave and after some huffing and puffing about how rude I am and what happened to manners and Onyx would've had fun they both did.\\n\\nNow today my friend called asking if they could stop by. I explained that I would love to have her over but her husband was no longer welcome. She got upset and told me that he was just like that and it was hard to tell sometimes because he had never seen me have a full blown seizure. I got kinda mad and sarcastically asked her if I should purposely cause a seizure so her husband was comfortable. She just kept repeating that he meant no harm and wanted Onyx to have fun. I just told her again that she is welcome but he is not.\\n\\nAITA. I feel awful and feel like I'm creating an issue but that man is just toxic energy and I worry that his disbelief of my need for a service animal will cause him to do something completely crazy.\\n\\n\\nEdit.

It's not massive; 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.\\n\\nOur only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. \\n\\nRecently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.\\n\\nI was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for \\\"us all to get to the villa\\\".\\n\\nMy wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. \\n\\nI slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's \\\"family property\\\" which is obviously ridiculous. \\n\\nETA When we texted her on Sunday we offered a compromise: no master bedroom, and either get permission\\/insurances to use the fields, or reduce guest count to 25. We even offered to host a small rehearsal too but she rejected the offers.

My partner returned work on Monday but he came back to pick me up.\\n\\nThe timing was a bad because there was an important football game yesterday and it was really important for my partner to watch it. I am not English so I don't quite 'get' the importance but it's a big deal for him and so important, I wanted to make sure he'd see the game. I suggested booking a room near the hospital so we wouldn't miss it due to the drive but he wanted to see the game at a friend's place. He said he'd make it.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting to get me discharged he was getting agitated because it was taking a long time. He had to wait outside so he was in his car the whole time because of restrictions at the hospital. After a couple of hours he sent me a text that he had to leave or he'd miss the game. I begged him to not leave and reminded I could book a hotel. But he left without me, and luckily made it on time to see the start of the game. He said he'd come pick me up tomorrow (today) instead. \\n\\nThe hospital wouldn't let me stay another night or leave alone. Luckily, one of my friends came to get me in the end. She didn't get to the hospital until late and we got back to London around 2am. The whole time I was trying to call and text my partner but he only said we could talk about it today. \\n\\nThe whole evening I was texting and calling my partner, ever since the moment he left me at the hospital. He only sent me one whatsapp back that said he'd pick me up later but wanted to see the game. When I got home in the night he was so angry at me. He said I was the most selfish asshole for constantly ringing and texting him during the game and that I ruined the game for him and embarrassed him infront of his friends. He said he cannot even look at me and that I bring so much drama with me it's humiliating to him. I feel at complete loss. I think I might be the asshole for not understanding the cultural significance of football and asking my bf to do a completely unreasonable drive to pick me up.

Moreover, they\\u2019ve only dated for a little more than a year. \\n\\nI told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.\\n\\nThe problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn\\u2019t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn\\u2019t have to work at all during the school year. \\n\\nSince I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.\\n\\nShe now says that she\\u2019s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT).

But it\\u2019s not just a free handout.\\n\\nShe\\u2019s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he\\u2019s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fianc\\u00e9, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.\\n\\nWell we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife.

She reminded me of Molly. \\n\\nI decided to help in other ways. I got her a better job opportunity by calling someone I knew at the time. This way she still had to work to earn money which is something she wanted. And also work a better job that appreciated her more than the previous job.

I cried although I'm not good at expressing emotions and it got worse after Molly's death.\\n\\nMy wife knew about the baby and demanded I give her the address so she could go see her granddaughter. I refused because Sarah asked me not to tell. And because she's already dealing with postpartum and will not be able to deal with her mom's behavior. My wife threw a fit and said that this is her daughter and grandbaby and I shouldn't try to stop her from seeing her. She called me selfish and cruel. The argument didn't stop. The family are agreeing with her and telling me to stay out of it. I argued with my wife about it again. And she said I had no right and that I needed to give her the address.

She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn\\u2019t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn\\u2019t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn\\u2019t want to do it.\\n\\nAfter the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn\\u2019t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to,\\u201d but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.\\n\\nThings got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy\\/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.\\n\\nThe conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn\\u2019t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I\\u2019ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we\\u2019re using and so on.

Will said really quickly he was sure I was \\\"the one,\\\" not only for himself but also for his kids. That we'd have an incredible, happy family life. We got married when I was 23, Will was 30, and his kids were 8 and 6. Our wedding ceremony also included me and the kids making promises to each other, which was Will's idea. \\n\\nSoon Will shoved ALL the childcare onto me. I wasn't a stay at home spouse, I worked full time and always have. But he always had \\\"reasons\\\" for me to do the childcare - him being sore from doing a physical job, me being \\\"better\\\" at it since I babysat kids this age in the past and he never had. Or \\\"girl stuff\\\" for his daughter. Or cooking or anything. He always had some reason and it ended up always on me. \\n\\nHe started playing video games and \\\"relaxing\\\" from getting home until bed, because he was \\\"tired\\\" and he was \\\"bringing in the money and keeping the roof over everyone's heads,\\\" though that wasn't really true. He said he DESERVED to relax. Then he went out with his friends or brought them back to drink beer and watch loud TV. \\n\\nHe developed a major attitude with me, and encouraged same in the kids. They found it funny. He started openly disrespecting me and encouraged them to also. He was the ultimate \\\"fun dad\\\" and I got put in the role of the mean witch. Sometimes they all ganged up on me and mocked me. But also all expected me to serve them and constantly be jumping up to care for them.\\n\\nBy the end of the first year I realized the marriage was a big mistake, but felt guilty leaving because of my promises to the kids. Another year went by and I realized that no matter how I tried, and how I knew they were only kids and I didn't really blame them, I genuinely hated both of the kids. And I could not lie to myself any more and pretend that I loved them. I did not, and I never would. One day I just walked out, packed up everything of mine and moved out while nobody was at home. I left a note explaining it wasn't working and saying goodbye. That was the end. \\n\\nCue shitstorm from my ex and a bitter divorce, but we both walked away with what we went into the marriage with (not much for either of us).

I maintained low contact and didn't visit them in person until I was 26, when they contacted me on my younger brother passing uni.\\n\\nFor the last two years, I have visited them four times and each time they've been talking about marriage although I stated very clearly that I wasn't interested. They brought up kids and how finding guys willing to marry older women was hard. I said no problem because I'm child free and that I don't need\\/want them to find a guy for me.\\n\\nJanuary this year, I went to visit them and they said that they had something 'special' for me and that I would absolutely love it. The day after I reached their home, they said they were throwing me a 'welcome home party'. I thought they were trying to fix our relationship and let it be.\\n\\nThey invited a lot of people and it had obviously already been planned. An hour in, my parents introduced me to a man in his thirties(F) and his parents.\\n\\nSo, next thing I know, F goes down on one knee and whips out a beautiful ring. I'm surprised and angry at my parents for still trying to control my life and putting me in such a situation.\\n\\nI said no, but then our parents began to push my buttons and I exploded. I called F, his parents and my parents low-lifes for trying to trick me and basically insulted their views, calling them misogynistic and disgusting.\\n\\nTold them to go f themselves and left.

Thing is, they were in on it. They expected me to say yes and sent me a lot of insults when I refused to reconsider. \\n\\nThey were humiliated and in their tiny group of small-minded people, my parents were being ostracized for raising a 'whore' of a daughter. F and his parents were also humiliated because they were rejected by a 'whore'. \\n\\nAITA for being so rude? I feel like I should've handled the situation more delicately, rather than blowing up at all of them.\\n\\nEDIT: Wow! I did not expect so many NTA's or responses. When I said that they were 'in on it' I meant that my parents had told them that I hadn't met the 'right guy' and that I would come around, which is why they kept trying. My parents expected me to surrender all my savings and money to F, live with F and his family in India, procreate with F three times and do all the housework when I can't even make a poached egg. \\n\\nAbout letting me go to college, I told them two weeks before leaving for it and lived at my friend's house with all my important documents, because I knew that they would do pretty much anything to keep me from going. They called my uni and said that I wouldn't be joining. Uni contacted me and I cleared it up. That's why I didn't talk to them and declined to let them pay.\\n\\nFor those of you who told me to wear a faux ring- I'm engaged to my girlfriend of five years and my parents aren't getting an invite to the wedding.

We're having quite a large wedding (fiance has a big family, and we have a lot of friends), but my family is very small. My only family is my mom (never met my dad), and I have an aunt and uncle who are childfree. Since I was little, having no father I always wanted my uncle to walk me down the aisle.\\n\\nMy mom married my step dad when I was 12, and I've never liked him. He's a bully. He says horrible things to people, says racist, sexist, transphobic things for attention, and heavily contributed to my mental illness and eating disorder as a teenager. My mom knows that we don't get along, and she knows I didn't like him, but I gave up on confiding in her about how much I disliked him when I was around 15, because she would always insist that despite having a nasty mouth, he was a really good guy and he would never hurt us. So, it's been around 8 years since I've told my mom I hate him. I moved out when I was 19 with my boyfriend. I visit my mom maybe 3-4 times a week, I would try to time this around my step dad working so I wouldn't see him. As a result of seeing him less, I was more able to ignore his horribleness and we stopped arguing. I mostly stopped talking to him. He still refers to me as his daughter and my mother insists he loves me. It is not mutual, but everyone has assumed that I love him too and our relationship is just based on 'banter' rather than tormenting.\\n\\nSo, when I got engaged, I asked my uncle almost straight away if he would walk me down the aisle. He was over the moon, but my aunt was like 'oh, you aren't picking step dad?' and I said no, I've always wanted uncle to do it. A few hours later, my mom called me crying asking why I wouldn't want step dad to do it, saying it's broken his heart. I told her that I've always dreamed of having uncle do it. She pressed on about how heartbroken he is, saying he always thought we had a good, funny relationship. This is where I feel like an ass. I said, 'there was nothing funny about him ruining my self esteem and teenage years. I hate him and if it were up to me, he wouldn't even be at the wedding'. My mom said that she's horrified that I still feel this way, once again spouting that he's a good guy and he loves me. I repeated that I hate the guy, and she said she'll tell him to back off.\\n\\nHe's now angry at me and has asked my uncle not to walk me. My uncle is now not speaking to him, and I feel like I've torn what little family I have apart. AITA?\"},{\"index\":453,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I have been remarried for a year now to my wife.

We have not had sex for six months because he cannot stop talking about my \\\"boobies\\\" and it makes me sick.\\n\\nJust before the pandemic hit, we were out at a restaurant with some friends, he actually ordered a \\\"chicky sammy\\\" like, said that exact phrase. Chicky. Sammy. Look, it's totally fine that he ordered the chicken sandwich. That's not the issue. Our friends noticed the baby talk, because he insisted on continuing the \\\"joke\\\" and even started talking with this god awful toddler... lilt? Accent?\\n\\nAfter that, I just couldn't stomach the idea of going out with him to adult places. I'd go out to the brewery with friends, but god forbid he join me and say \\\"Me wanty 'nother beer!\\\" or something.\\n\\nI don't know where it came from. I don't know why he's doing this. I finally hit my limit when we were grocery shopping and everything seemed normal and fine until he gasped like a kid, ran to the ice cream section and jumped up and down yelling \\\"ICE CWEAM ICE CWEAM! I WANT CHOCWIT!\\\"\\n\\nI was *MORTIFIED*. People were staring at him and me.

And shit like that. I just said fuck it, and left the store, leaving him to walk home (like a mile, it was fine) because I couldn't even look at him.\\n\\nSince then, things have been very tense, and he keeps telling me that he wants an apology for embarrassing him by leaving him in the store. I told him that people don't get to demand apologies, if someone wants to apologize, it's up to them, and I am absolutely not going to apologize for saving myself the embarrassment of a 35 year old man with a mortgage and retirement account asking for \\\"CHOCWIT ICE CWEAM.\\\"\\n\\nHe got his fucking Mom involved, no joke.

Especially about the sexual comments. I've made it extremely, abundantly clear that him using terms like \\\"boobies\\\" and \\\"wee wee\\\" are absolutely *repulsive* to me, among other things he says.\\n\\n**INFO:** Does he have a job? Yes, and he acts completely normal as far as I know. He worked from home for a while during lockdown, and I never heard him talk like this to anyone he worked with. \\n\\n**Does he do it with friends?** Sometimes, and it's generally meant to annoy them or gross them out, but he stops. He has friends where they think its \\\"cute\\\" to embarrass each other. \\n\\n**Is this a kink\\/fetish?:** If so, I'm absolutely done. (Edited because it was offensive)\\n\\n**Has he seen a doctor?**: No, but I've asked him if he needed to talk to someone because he was acting strange, and he accused me of being stuck up and judgmental. Given that he doesn't act like this with his coworkers, or his family, and only jokes around with his friends, I'm willing to bet that this is an indication that he's trying to force this fetish on me nonconsensually, or trying to get me to leave.\\n\\n**Is it a tumor?**: I don't know. Like I said above, I asked him if he needed to see someone. I can't force him (even if I want to, just find out if there's any way we can salvage this), but after this post closes I will try to get him to. Maybe his sister can encourage him, even though he acts completely normal around them.\\n\\n**Does he have childhood trauma?:** As far as I know, and I'm relatively close to his family and would likely know, the most traumatic thing he had happen was a minor car accident when he was around 13 years old. No injuries, no death, etc. He hasn't been in a car accident in the past two years or anything like that, and I haven't, and AFAIK no one else in his family has been, etc.\\n\\n**I want to send you a chat instead of my comment getting lost**: Please don't. I've had a number of people repost this to make fun of me because I didn't respond the way they wanted, etc. Just comment, I can at least to respond to those and help others get an idea of what's going on.\"},{\"index\":454,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I am black, and my wife is also black.

That ended with her being wheelchair bound. This caused her to develop a lot of resentment towards me. She would get angry if I worked out or played any sports. So, I stopped doing anything physical mostly. We tried counseling for a year and things didn't improve. In the end, we broke up. \\n\\nEver since Elle was born, I took out a private insurance for me, Elle and Hayley. This helped out a lot when she had her accident. Post break up, I still kept her in my insurance because she couldn't find any work and I knew if I dropped her from the insurance, she wouldn't be able to afford any treatments. \\n\\nIt's been 2 years since then. We have 50\\/50 custody, so I don't pay any child support. In the beginning, I kept a very keen eye to make sure that she didn't resent Elle like she resented me. She didn't, so I relaxed. She is still on that insurance because she is not able to find any job except wellfare. I wanted both Hayley and Elle to be well, so I kept the insurance. \\n\\nHalf a year ago when Elle came to stay, I noticed that  she was very depressed and had gotten very fat compared to before. Nothing overweight. But Elle does ballet and I have never seen her put on that much weight. Turns out Hayley forbade Elle from doing ballet because \\\"Hayley used to do ballet and Elle is just trying to rub her face in it\\\". The same for any physical activities like sports or exercising. With the quarantine, it must have been hell to live like that. Elle pretty much broke down and said that for the past few months, things have been escalating to the point that she is scared to walk inside her own house. She just stays in her room and comes out only to eat. Elle just begged me to go to court, so that I can get full custody. \\n\\nElle is at an age where her opinion matter in court, but it's almost impossible to get 100 percent custody in my state unless I can prove incompetency, according to my lawyer. \\n\\nSo, I dropped her from the insurance. Elle was supposed to stay with me for the next 6 months. Hayley couldn't get a job. She wiped out her savings as she had to pay for all her treatments. It was getting to the point that she couldn't even afford to get basic things for herself, let alone Elle. \\n\\nI also applied for sole custody. Given her financial situation and the pandemic and Elle's preference, the judge gave me full custody with supervised visitation for Hayley. Hayley didn't have a good representation at court due to her financial situation. Also, there is a pandemic going on. I left an already vulnerable person without any medical insurance. \\n\\nI know I did what i had to do to protect my child. But I did so by taking advantage of the medical expenses of a disabled woman. \\n\\nElle is happy. Hayley obviously thinks I am a manipulative bastard. Everyone seems to have mixed opinions. AITA here? \\n\\nAlso, dropping her from my insurance was completely legal.

The first hug I have received in my life was at 10 years old when Dan (my mom's BF) hugged me when I thanked him for a gift. My mom had my sister a year later. My sister was the perfect baby sister anyone could ask for. Mom and Dan split and at first mom had major custody of my sister. Mom did the same thing to my sister she did to me, doesn't even acknowledge us in the room if she was not in the mood, not feeding us dinner if we made a mistake, made everything our fault. When Dan found out, he applied for full custody for my sister but my mother fought and somehow wrangled 50% of custody.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThings got real bad for me and the only silver lining was my sister. Despite being only 4 years old, she would sneak in snacks from her dad for me to eat. Anything Dan bought for her, he also bought me. He wasn't wealthy by any means but it was the small things and anytime he dropped my sister, he will take his time to talk to me. He was the only father I have ever known. Dan died of cancer when I was 16 and my sister 5. He lived only 3 months from the diagnosis but settled everything financially as able as he can for my sister. He split his assets 75% for my sister and 25% for me to be given to me when I reached 18. Knowing my mom very well, he made me the executor of my sister's fund too. To say my mom was furious was an understatement. She literally made the next 2 years of my life and my sister a living hell.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen my mom started dating Brad, he already had a daughter 3 years younger than my sister. My mom had made it absolutely clear that my sister will be allowed to go to college only if she shares her trust fund with our stepsister. Brad is a piece of work and me and my sister never really bonded with our stepsister. She refused to sign anything related to my sister's education unless I give her my word that I will give my step sister equal half of the trust fund. This is where I think I was the asshole. I held the trust fund above my mom's head to treat my sister fairly. I repeatedly told them I will give my step sister half the fund until my sister was 18 and moved to college.  Once she moved out, we both cut any contact we had with our mom and blocked her. I made my sister give her the wrong college info, so our mom couldn't contact her.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have found out through few friends my mom didn't know I have that my step sister couldn't get into any college because she didn't want to apply any loans and she is very depressed.

The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nso yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that \\\"Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.\\\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.\\n\\nAITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?\\n\\nTLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?\\n\\nEdit to add:\\n\\nAs many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLeut is already microcipped and wears a collar and tag.

My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.\\n\\nHere we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he \\\"looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair\\\". I texted back, \\\"I'll take it for $4,000\\\" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.\\n\\nHere's the issue at hand. The guitar was\\/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, \\\"well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask.\\\" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to \\\"sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam.\\\" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nUPDATE: \\n\\nWell this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:\\n\\nThe guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.\\n\\nThe dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.\\n\\nI would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would \\\"do bad things\\\" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.\\n\\nAnd to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale\\/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.\"},{\"index\":506,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"\\n\\nI come from a conservative christian family.

Someone else always hosts (we typically help \\\"sponsor\\\" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.\\n\\nOther than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: \\\"So did we get a turkey?\\\"\\n\\nI looked at him and said \\\"Well, I know I didn't. Did you?\\\"\\n\\nHe stared at me blankly and said \\\"No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?\\\"\\n\\nI shrugged and said \\\"I don't know nothing about no turkey.\\\"\\n\\nThe kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said \\\"I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.\\\"\\n\\nHe blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.\\n\\nI said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?\\n\\nHe just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his \\\"office\\\" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.\\n\\nSo I just looked at him and said \\\"Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?\\\"\\n\\nHe told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.\\n\\nBefore you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was \\\"getting down on the floor playing\\\" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.\\n\\nAnyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.\\n\\nThe kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.\\n\\nAlso, we don't do Christmas. \\n\\nCheck your biases, folks.

One big rule we share is if our daughter breaks something, she pays for it.\\n\\nNow, sis (27) and I are the only grandkids. Aunt never married. Instead, she worked with Gma and Gpa at their seamstry store, and took it over when they retired.\\n\\nSis's girlfriend (29) proposed last year. Gpa offered to make FSIL a custom suit, which she was over the moon about. Gma had me ask Sis what her dream dress was and record the convo. Sis, thinking it was just between us, told me in great detail what her dream dress was, though said it was way too expensive, so she would get something much cheaper. \\n\\nWell, a few months later Gma surprised Sis with her dream wedding dress. It fot perfectly and everyone cried. \\n\\nSadly, Gma recently passed away, which hit us all hard. Sis was devistated, but decided that the dress meant Gma would still be there with us at the wedding. \\n\\nThe issue comes in with C. She's very large, much larger then Sis. Three days ago, we decided to go visit Sis and see how she was doing. It was great, but then C asked if she could try on the dress. Sis politely said no. C made a face, but dropped it. \\n\\nLater, we decided to go grab dinner. Sis and I went to pick up our orders, but C decided to stay and play with Sis's dog.\\n\\nWe got back, and the dress was destroyed. C had apparently tried to get it on, popping some seams, and got stuck. Instead of waiting for help, she cut her way out. The dress was hacked to bits.\\n\\nSis was devistated and asked us to leave. I grounded C, and called Aunt with some pictures, asking if it could be saved. She said there was no. She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take. \\n\\nC has about 15,000 saved from various jobs, as well as winning writing competitions. This was supposed to help her in college. \\n\\nI took her to the bank and set in motion transferring all the funds, since as her parent I still have control over it. $12k to Aunt to pay for the new dress. $3k to my sister's wedding, as an emotional distress tax. \\n\\nI explained exactly why this was happening to C, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault. I told her she could get a job if she didnt get a scholarship, and it was her fault for trying on the dress after she'd been told no, and for not waiting until we got back. A few popped seams could have been fixed. Hacking the dress to pieces couldnt. \\n\\nC told my ex, and while she agreed C was in the wrong after the full story, said I shouldnt have \\\"ruined her future\\\" for a \\\"free\\\" dress. I reminded her of our rule, and she still thinks I'm wrong. \\n\\nSo, am I the asshole here?\\n\\nEdit - since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that C destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value. \\n\\nI pointed out how young we has her because I wanted to explain how a 31 year old has a 16 year old kid. I do not resent having her, she's the best thing Ive ever done. I also brought up C's size because Sis has crohn's disease, and thus is very tiny. The dress was made her for size, and C is much larger then Sis. I love C as she is, but just holding the dress up, it was clear it wouldnt fit. \\n\\nThe character count is very limiting.\\n\\nEdit 2 - to clarify, the money was C's \\\"have fun at college\\\" money, not her college fund. My ex and I are paying for whatever scholarships dont. When she was asking what she would do for college, she was askong what'd she do for fun and to buy things we didnt pay for. Again, the character count is very limiting, so i had to cut details to post.\\n\\nEdit 3 - So, I got off the phone with my ex about 20 minutes ago. At some of your suggestions, I sent her the pictures, and she freaked. She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally C cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was \\\"unfair\\\" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got \\\"nothing,\\\" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words. \\n\\nHonestly, knowing she did it on purpose has just made things worse. The fact that she could be so cruel, thats not the daughter we tried to raise. She will be going to therapy, whether that's in person when local therapists start taking new clients again or on one of those apps people have mentioned. We need to talk about it more. Her punishment stands as is, though we're going to see how therapy goes. \\n\\nAs for all the seamsters who have reached out, please know I'm touched by your kindness. I really am. My aunt is going to see if she can incorporate at least some of the fabric from the old dress into the new one, maybe at least try to save the beading, but if there's anything usable I'll reach out. I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people. \\n\\nI have yet to talk to my sister, but I have talked to her fiance. Sis isnt doing well. The stress has caused a crohns flare up, so she's stuck in bed sick. Which, honestly, I'm not surprised. Crohns is often triggered by stressful events, so I was expecting it. I told fiance about Aunt making a new dress, and she promised to take the remains over to Aunt on Monday. She's thankful for us addressing the issue, but has asked for some space from Sis so she can recover and heal, and hopefully not end up in the hospital. \\n\\nAs for the 3k, we'll see what my sister's state is in a few days. If she has to go to the hospital, then the money is forfit for her medical bills, since it was C's selfishness that put her there, so she can pay for it. If Sis does not end up in the hospital, then I'll consider giving it back after she's gone to therapy for a few months, if she's accepted what she did was wrong and worked to make ammends. \\n\\nWe'll see what the next few monthd bring.\"},{\"index\":541,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I (25f) fucking hate wearing bras. They're uncomfortable, constricting, and expensive. With work from home, I spent the last year and a half basically never wearing a bra and got used to it. Quite frankly, my boobs are nonexistent anyways.\\n\\nI recently started going to the gym again and started working out braless. I should note that up until now, no one has ever pointed out anything wrong with me not wearing a bra. However, in the middle of a set of squats (yes, MID SQUAT),  a guy comes up to me, taps me on the shoulder to get my attention, and tells me that my nipples are poking through my shirt. I get really irritated because why tf is this guy staring at my nipples in the first place and then stopping me mid-set to inform me?\\n\\nI get really annoyed, try to finish my set, but then this fucker literally grabs the bar, as I ascend and re-racks it for me. He claimed it looked like I was having trouble with the last rep, and that he had come over to make sure I could do it, then noticed my nipples. I'm really fucking pissed off at this point and told him I didn't need his help finishing my set and why the fuck was he looking at my chest in the first place?? He said he was going to spot me, but then noticed my chest and thought it'd be inappropriate.\\n\\nI pointed out that the safety bar was set, so even if I did fail the set, he wasn't needed. But he just insisted people at gyms look out for each other, and that going forward, I should probably wear a bra so other people wouldn't get uncomfortable and that it may help me stay more balanced in my squats. I'm literally the only girl at the weights section of the gym at the moment, and other guys who were squatting and failed sets never have to worry about this shit. I've seen guys fail multiple sets in a row and no one ever rushes to their aid, but I have a very slight pause, and everyone thinks I need rescuing. So I'm now really annoyed and also kind of uncomfortable that this guy I've never spoken to in my life thinks he's helping me and then has the audacity to tell me how to dress.\\n\\nSo I tell him \\\"You have bigger boobs and nipples than I do. Maybe YOU should wear a bra so people won't get uncomfortable and you won't fail your squats.\\\" He then got really defensive, saying he was just trying to help, then called me a bitch. Honestly I'm not sure if I overreacted, but I'm still kind of pissed off so maybe that's clouding my judgment. AITA?\\n\\nEdit to add: I'm not sure if people think I'm walking around and it's extremely obvious my nipples are showing. I actually really hate constricting clothes. My t-shirt size is x-small but I wear size large to the gym (and pretty much everywhere lately), and you can't tell my stomach from my chest.

I am talking multiple failed IVF's, multiple late term miscarriages (one of which was a stillbirth). The struggle went on for for 7 years. \\n\\nI have helped her immensely through everything, financially and emotionally. Matt is... unsympathetic sometimes. He behaves as if it's a batch of bad cookies and immediately guilts her into trying again. So, it always was up me and Dan to take care of her. Despite many talks from me and Dan, she remained married to him and kept trying again and again. We have had many offers to leave the state\\/country for a better job, but didn't because we were scared to leave her alone. \\n\\n3 years ago, I got pregnant.

Turns out she finally got pregnant, had a baby boy who passed away 5 days after being born in NICU. Matt is also leaving her and screwed her over because of the prenup.

I moved most of my stuff to the living room so I could fit a small bed in there. Sis moved in, but she asked me to move more stuff to the living room. I moved pretty much everything sans the piano, to the point where the living room became uninhabitable. \\n\\nThen she started complaining about my violin playing, saying it gave her headaches. I told her I couldn't stop the daily practice without risking my only steady income. The arguments got worse. She told me to play only when she wasn't home, but with her work schedule I couldn't afford that.

It\\u2019s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with \\u2018Jess\\u2019 who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we\\u2019ve met before and she\\u2019s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.\\n\\nShe was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my \\u2018sister.\\u2019 I said I didn\\u2019t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don\\u2019t I know how much she\\u2019s been through. She\\u2019s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she\\u2019s very brave - but I don\\u2019t want to live with her.\\n\\nMy parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn\\u2019t even here yet.\\n\\nWe live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don\\u2019t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it\\u2019s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don\\u2019t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, \\u2018We like this place and have no solid plan.\\u2019 I freaked out and was like, \\u2018You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you\\u2019re changing everything I\\u2019ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life\\u2019s going to be, I don\\u2019t want to have a sister.\\u2019\\n\\nGood to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is \\u2018too much effort.\\u2019\\n\\nMy parents are offended that I\\u2019m \\u2018not being welcoming\\u2019 towards my \\u2018sister\\u2019, and I\\u2019m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I\\u2019m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy.

She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.\\n\\nIt's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing.

We had the \\\"what if\\\" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.\\n\\nYesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.\\n\\nI'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.\\n\\nI just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much\\/little I would be involved in raising him or her.\\n\\nAITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?\\n\\nEdit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I\\u2019m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I\\u2019m going to get snipped ASAP.\\n\\nEdit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:\\n\\n* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.\\n* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).\\n* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.\"},{\"index\":508,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"6 years ago I met the best person in the world.

None of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they\\u2019ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank.

I was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. \\n\\n\\nI was not, however, expecting them to demand I GIVE them all the money (close to $40,000) I\\u2019d made from the ages of 14-18. \\n\\n\\nThe exact statement my mom had made was \\u201cYou made that money under our roof.

He has been really good to her and after meeting in person a few times, they decided to move in together. I was super happy for her as she had a few bad relationships over the years and it was nice to see her in a healthy one. That joy faded the last couple months before she moved a few states over to be with him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe issue isn't her moving, but that she repeatedly joked about having a baby from Chris. At first, I accepted it as jokes, but over time I realized Ashley was serious.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor context, Ashley has two children from a previous previous relationship, ages 10 and 12. Chris absolutely doesn't want kids. He told her this at the start and anytime she hinted possibly wanting more, he shot it down, saying it was a deal breaker. Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well. He's accepted that they are a package deal with her, and since they are at an age where they are semi-independent, it's not an issue for him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo me, Chris is a real bro for taking on her kids without issue. Hearing Ashley say she wants a baby out of him, \\\"one way or another\\\", bothered me to no end. It's hard enough to find a partner that treats you well and accepts children that aren't their own. To find one that does and then talk about plotting to force a baby seems gross and manipulative.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBefore her move, I had sat down with Ashley, trying to talk sense into her. At first she resisted, but finally it seemed she understood how shitty it would be. After I felt like she had understood, I put the issue behind me and helped support her thru the hassle of moving.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA few days after she left, I got a call from a mutual friend who delves into the Wiccan\\/Metaphysical realm. She was distraught and confessed to me that shortly before Ashley's move, Ashley had come to her asking for a fertility spell. This friend didn't feel comfortable about it and refused. When pushed, she said she cast a spell for a healthy and honest relationship, but told Ashley it was for fertility.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can imagine, I was livid. I messaged Ashley, confronting her about what I learned and she laughed it off as she was desperate, but magic is fake anyway, so what's the harm? She then let it slip, that since Chris was planning on getting a vasectomy in a few months, she had poked holes in their condoms as a last ditch effort.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt that point, I couldn't stay silent. I gathered up screenshots of all the conversations over the last few months and sent them to Chris. He understandably freaked out and kicked her out.

Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).\\n\\nEver since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing.

People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.\\n\\nEver since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years.

When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it.

I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me.

It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown.

She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born.

I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.\\n\\nI'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).\\n\\nAnyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.\\n\\nWithin about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. \\n\\nAnyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.\\n\\nUpdate: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. A few reminders for people: I'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.\"},{\"index\":529,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I (16F) used to have a good relationship with my mother.

A year later my SIL gave birth to a little girl. Two years later, she gave birth to a boy. Billy, who was 14 by this time, was treated like an outsider. My SIL and brother saw him as a burden who spoiled their picture perfect family. If you asked my SIL how many kids she had, she would say two. Billy started acting out. He got involved with a bad group of kids and started getting into trouble. He started failing all of his classes. He eventually got into drugs and was suspended from school. My brother and SIL were fed up with him.\\n\\nI asked my brother if Billy could spend the summer with me and my husband. We have a hobby farm and I thought maybe getting away from his life for awhile could help him some. Well, they were more than happy to get rid of him (my SIL's words). It was kind of rough the first few weeks. He had a lot of anger issues. But my husband kept his hands and mind busy doing work on the farm. And we both made sure that he knew he was loved and wanted. By August, he was a totally different kid. He wanted to keep living with us but my SIL insisted that he come home. After two months, he went back to his old ways due to his parents indifference. They ended up sending him back to us and he lived with us throughout high school. He ended up being an A\\/B student and kept with a really great group of kids. He got involved in baseball and got a scholarship to a local university. He's 22 now and is in his last year of school. He's engaged to a really great girl.\\n\\nWhen he was 16 he started calling me Mom and he started calling my husband Pops. He never really had much to do with his mom and he had nothing to do with my brother. He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said \\\"To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance.\\\" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.\\n\\nMy SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?\\n\\nEdited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that. \\n\\nAlso, I just want to thank everyone who left such sweet comments.

Anyway, we were all hanging out and there were no more seats in the car, so I suggested she sit on Joe's lap, but she chose to sit on mine, so I put a jacket on my lap so she wasn't directly on me.

I said nope, I'm like this with all my friends, and she said I thought you were like that with Joe as a joke because he's just your friend but me it's because you liked me, and that it made her confused because she knows I have a girlfriend. I said \\\"nope, I'm like that with everyone\\\" and told her I'm happy with my girlfriend and I don't want to date her. She called me an asshole and I haven't seen her since. Her best friend texted me and said I was being an asshole. I told my girlfriend \\\\[19F\\\\] against my friends wishes (who are also her friends, not Sarah, but Joe is) and she laughed and said that boys are so oblivious and that she could tell Sarah had a crush on me but she trusted me to make the right choices.

It kind of dawned on me that night. I never pursued her. I slept over her house once because I was too drunk to drive but I slept on the floor and didn't let her near me, and I would mention my girlfriend a lot because I'm excited about dating her.

She ended up texting me again and saying how I was a jerk and basically the friendship imploded. The last thing she said was that she wasn't sorry and I said \\\"well I can be sorry for the both of us.\\\" Joe still has a crush on her and I'm sure he's still trying to date her.

He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.\\n\\nMy mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.\\n\\nLong story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.\\n\\nWas I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).\\n\\nedit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?\\n\\nThere's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.\\n\\nLike one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.\\n\\nThis is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. \\n\\nMuch of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not \\\"trying harder\\\" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart.

I'll be getting some counselling, as suggested, to help deal with the constant what ifs in my brain and to help me move past this and to stop shouldering the burden.\\n\\nEdit: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the awards and positive vibes everyone, much appreciated. \\nClearing up a few things\\n- gf didn't steal, she was just doing her job getting change\\/paying invoices. The wife (who admitted to stealing later) simply used footage of her accessing the cash box to try to make it seem like she stole. I didn't state she was innocent as its innocent until proven guilty, and she wasn't found guilty, my mistake. \\n- it's been pointed out that with boss so unwell, perhaps it wasn't him doing this, but his wife. That's a great point I never considered, and now makes me feel even more guilty. I should have checked.\\n- we are in the UK so I guess our legal system works differently to the States in that I didn't have to pay a bail, just simply take her home and take her to the court dates. This could be why the policemen told us straight it seemed like bull and were very candid and kind to us; they even bought us lunch when one went to Subway.\\n- also as said, the surgery would have probably been cancelled anyway as I did have another welfare check (or two) scheduled for that week with the transplant team at the hospital and I was hugely stressed out. My work gave me that week and the following off anyway for being such a good sport.\\n- thanks for the dm's calling me a murderer, appreciated....\"},{\"index\":366,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"There's around 10 houses in my neighborhood of 120 that are not in the HOA, mine included. We (or previous owners) were smart enough to not join the HOA. As a result, i am able to make extensions and I have a pool, which I host neighborhood parties occasionally. My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.\\n\\nI made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are \\\"boycotting\\\" my party and hosting their own party. The party happened and nobody else showed up to theirs and ours was a blast.

N had run into him at a club and drunkenly confessed to the pregnancy. We met up, he bonded with his daughter and well that man is now my husband of 7 years. Coming back to my sister, she called me yesterday. Although I was surprised at her call, I picked up. We made some small talk,  then she said she had just gotten married a year back and both of them wanted children but couldn't because her husband was infertile but really wanted kids. I asked her if she wanted to adopt and she said she would just need to get her baby back. I was speechless for a few moments before replying that if she wants to meet my child as an aunt she is welcome to and we both can sit V down and explain the reason for her absence but she can't just ask me to give up my child. She said she'll sue me as she's the birth mother. I told her she was out of her mind and I told her about T. She exploded. Calling me names and saying I stole her life.

Honestly I think it was fluke. I\\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\\n\\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\\u2019t and still don\\u2019t mind, it\\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \\n\\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \\n\\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\\u2019t know how but I did. \\n\\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\\u2019t been herself. I haven\\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\\u2019t get in because she didn\\u2019t). \\n\\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\\u2019t in a million years imagine I\\u2019d get in. I\\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\\u2019t go, I\\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \\n\\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\\u2019s worked compared to me...\\n\\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\\u2019t. She\\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\\n\\nUPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. \\n\\nWell, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn\\u2019t I tell her earlier and she\\u2019s so proud of me\\n\\nBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...\\n\\nI going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.\\n\\nUpdate 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn\\u2019t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update \\n\\nSo after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:\\n\\n&gt; I\\u2019m sorry for how I reacted; please don\\u2019t be mad. I\\u2019m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It\\u2019s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you\\u2019re going to be where I wanted to be and I\\u2019m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I\\u2019m sorry I\\u2019m ranting I just need more time\\n\\nI\\u2019m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I\\u2019m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don\\u2019t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we\\u2019re going to drift apart which would suck because we\\u2019re best friends and I just don\\u2019t want to lose my sister :(\\n\\nUpdate 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \\n\\nThen they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.\\n\\nI stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\\n\\nI still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.\\n\\nUpdate 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support!

I work 60-100 hours a week, so if anyone needs time off, it\\u2019s me. \\n\\nLast year, my brother and SIL asked me to babysit on the day of an informal work meeting, a lake retreat organized by my company.

They continued to nag me about how they haven\\u2019t gone on a date for so long. \\n\\nThe night before that day, they called in a panic and said their friend Mike from the next city over had been in a car accident, and I needed to babysit nephew for a few hours so that they could go visit Mike. I reluctantly agreed, with the stipulation that they\\u2019d be back by 7 am the next day to pick nephew up so I could leave for my work event. They did not come back until two days later. I had to cancel on my superiors morning of, which looked awful. My brother and SIL never responded to multiple texts and calls from me. Their excuse was that Mike\\u2019s life was in danger and they were too busy helping his girlfriend. I accepted that, since I had met both Mike and his girlfriend at a party in the past and thought they were good people, but I emphasized that this absolutely could not happen again.

I ran into her and asked her how Mike was recovering. Apparently, she had no idea he had ever been hospitalized. Neither did Mike. Mike had never been in an accident, and although brother and SIL had gone to visit them recently, it was for drinks and bowling, not bringing them chicken noodle soup in the hospital. I confronted brother and SIL, and they denied at first, but finally admitted they had been lying about Mike\\u2019s accident so that they could go on date nights. They claimed I \\u201cgave them no choice since I would never help them out when they needed time together because parenting was so stressful and difficult and I had no idea and it was just a little white lie\\u201d. \\n\\nI made it clear that after this incident, I would never babysit for them again, and I\\u2019ve stuck to that. Yesterday my brother and SIL begged me to babysit for them because there was an actual medical emergency in SIL\\u2019s family. They even sent me proof of the relative\\u2019s hospitalization. I still said no. They didn\\u2019t care about betraying my trust, so I don\\u2019t care if they can\\u2019t afford childcare or if their relative is in the hospital.

She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.\\n\\nEdit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.\\n\\nVisibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.\\n\\nMy mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.\\n\\nThen a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.\\n\\nLast week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.\\n\\nIt's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her \\\"special little guy\\\" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.\\n\\nI feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: I DO NOT GIVE CONSENT FOR THIS TO BE TURNED INTO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE\"},{\"index\":324,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I don't have a problem with the idea of parents who stay home with their kids.

As in, no college, no jobs, no certifications, nothing at all to support herself until that time might come.\\n\\nI told her that it doesn't have to be college, that not everyone needs college.

I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.\\n\\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:\\n\\n* Dairy\\n\\n* Wheat\\/Flour\\/Gluten\\n\\n* Legumes\\n\\nSince I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. \\n\\nI never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.\\n\\nI noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.\\n\\nIt didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.\\n\\nI was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. \\n\\nShe has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got \\\"carb addicted.\\\" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.\\n\\nAm I the asshole and an ungrateful son for losing it over this?\"},{\"index\":309,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"So my asshole scumbag parents named me Qur'stylle and my whole life i have gotten shit like \\\"are you muslim\\\" \\\"what language is your name originated from?\\\" \\\"what country are you from\\\" and people butchering its pronunciation, for obvious reasons.

(55M) in accounting, my dad has been unwell for the last 4 years due to asbestosis it has been really hard on the family and he is getting worse but is still loving life. \\n\\nI have been running the business for the last 2 years we have expanded and now have 50 vans in the fleet and one qualified and one trainee allocated to each van, covid was hard in the beginning but we have bounced back, my dad still works on tools with me on Fridays (half day then back to my place for some beers), Friday is the only day I\\u2019m on tools now as I\\u2019m doing everything to run the business.\\n\\nwell last month he told the family he is stepping down from the business due to health and wants to spend more time with my mother, and is giving the business to my brother and for me to step down from acting CEO, this upset me iv been with the business for 12 years, at the beginning it was only me and my dad my brother never wanted to be in the business said it was not worth his time and now he\\u2019s the boss, and iv been dumped back to a heating engineer with a \\u00a320,000 pay cut, he doesn\\u2019t have any clue what we do or how to do it. \\n\\nI spoke to my dad and he told me that my brother deserve it for all he has done, that he has a family and I don\\u2019t and that he went to uni , a lot of the workers are upset about the decision and have told me they will go where I go. \\n\\nI told my dad that if that is how he feels then I will leave and start my own business I have not spoke to my dad or brother since and have told them to never contact me, for the last month Iv had thousands of calls and messages from family saying some very hurtful things and telling me I\\u2019m ungrateful for what I have so AITA???\\n\\nEDIT I want to say thank you to everyone for your kind words there are so many to reply to I will do my best to thank you all, to hear my father tell me in his own way he doesn\\u2019t think I\\u2019m good enough was hard and for my family to take his and my brother side was even harder. \\n\\nIn the morning I will contact the large clients iv worked with over the last 6 years I know we had some site postponed due to covid (big money), and will try and take them over I have 20 of my colleagues wishing to come work for me iv saved nearly all of the money I have earned over the last 12 years so think I have enough to get myself on my feet.\\n\\nUpdate I want to inform everyone that I\\u2019m not starting a business to destroy my brother, as much as I want to iv spent almost 13 year build it and I don\\u2019t want to see anyone out of a job or for the business to die it\\u2019s about 0500 in England you have all helped me so much. \\n\\nI will be going over to talk to my father about 0800 and take him out for breakfast and talk, I\\u2019m not sure if I will get a proper answer from him but I love my family and want my future kids to know them. \\n\\nI will update after the events of later today.\\n\\nUpvoted 2: as I said in one of the comments I believe my family had found my post and they did.\\n\\nThis morning when I arrived at my parents house my mum opened the door and looked like she had been cry a lot my dad came over to talk to me and we went out for breakfast, he didn\\u2019t say a word on the way there or when we arrived, when on the way back he asked if we could pull over and talk I can honestly say this was the first tile I saw my dad cry, I asked why he did this to me he said doesn\\u2019t know I keeper pushing and he finally told me he owed it to my brother for not being about for him as much as me when we were growing up and there was times my brother needed him but we was working. \\n\\nI couldn\\u2019t believe it after 12 years of hard work that was his reasoning I told me father I had spent half my life working to do everything for the business and how he throw me to the side just because he\\u2019s son came back hurt more then I could explain, he told me he knows as they had been shown the post I put up, to my surprise he wasn\\u2019t mad he seemed remorseful, he told me my mother has been in pieces after reading the comments about how bad she treated me and thinks I will never talk to them again, my dad told me after reading it all he released he should have split the business between us as it will need both of us to keep progressing and apologies to me for never telling me how proud he was of everything I had done and thought I know how proud he was, but my brother has full control my father has no say any more and my brother would never go 50\\/50, he told me he wants me to go back as my brother will need me I told him that\\u2019s not my problem anymore after the demoted me and cut my pay I tried to make it work for 3 weeks but my brother wouldn\\u2019t listen didn\\u2019t believe I know what I was talking about telling me he knows how to fun a business, so I left why work my ass off there when I could do the same work and make more money for my self. \\n\\nMy dad broke down said that he had destroyed the family and should never had done what he did I don\\u2019t understand why I took this long to release I was a valuable piece in the company.\\n\\nUpdate 3: as I said I have had a couple of zoom calls with some clients today and they have gone very well, I have been informed that they we all be sending be signed proposal letters for the up and coming work, lucky the site start dates don\\u2019t clash that was one of the main things I was worried about, 3 of my colleagues have now left the business and have spoken to my dad informing him about why they left and that they will be coming to work with me under there own choice, to hear them tell me this meant a lot, they all have between 5 - 10 year more experience in the industry, at the moment I have all we need to start a new business with the 3 vans I own and tools I have built up over the years, I am looking forward to the new venture in my life and can\\u2019t wait to share this with my children when I have them.\\n\\n\\nThen I received a call from my father asking me to come over for dinner I was unsure at first but thought it was probably a step in the right direction, on arrival my whole family was there, I went in and the atmosphere dropped my mum wouldn\\u2019t look at me and my brother just sat there acting as if I didn\\u2019t exist, my dad came and asked me and my brother to come in to his office, he started to ask when I was going to return to the company as they need me in early Monday morning, I could not even believe what I was hearing I told them both I\\u2019m not coming back and have started my own company, and what dose he mean we you gave the business to him (my brother), my brother stated to lose his temper telling me if I cared about to company why would I leave, I have some very choice words before telling him that I have always cared for the company and spent 12 years of my life working to make it successful, unlike him who swans in and takes all the glory and that i will not sit there and be treated like that, I told my brother to f**k off so I could talk to dad, I asked what was this morning all about telling me he\\u2019s sorry but then expects me to going running back, he couldn\\u2019t even look me in the eye so I left said goodbye to my cousin, nieces and nephews and walked out iv been riding for about 3 hours on and off coming back on here to talk to people. \\n\\nI just want to say thank you to everyone for the personal message, comments, rewards and all the kind words and encouragement I\\u2019ll try and message everyone but I\\u2019m exhausted and will most likely fall asleep.\\n\\n\\nUpdate 4: sorry it\\u2019s been a while iv had a lot going on in the last couple of weeks, I\\u2019ll try and explain the most I can, so the new business is going very well we have a lot of work coming in and making good money, at the end on the year I will be looking at expanding so very happy with that.\\n\\nme and my fianc\\u00e9 are very happy she is very busy planning the wedding of her dreams she wants me to wear a suit but tough lucky I\\u2019ll be in my kilt, I couldn\\u2019t be happier then I am right now waking up to her every day, she is there for me no matter what and has been my rock through everything.\\n\\nThen my family my father and brother still refuse to talk to me and have told me they will not be attending the wedding even though they haven\\u2019t been invited, my mother has called my fianc\\u00e9 but hasn\\u2019t said much only to ask about wedding stuff and will not talk to me, my fianc\\u00e9 family have been amazing my soon to be in-laws have been helping with the wedding and everything else and I am extremely thankful for everything they have done for us.\\n\\nMy other family have now backed off and apologised and want to make amends for everything that was said.\\n\\nMyself and my fianc\\u00e9 are set to have are wedding in November, we sat

It didn\\u2019t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. \\n\\nPeople thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn\\u2019t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. \\n\\nFast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn\\u2019t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. \\n\\nHowever, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn\\u2019t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex\\u2019s fault. He took a paternity test. \\n\\nThe poor baby girl was NEVER my ex\\u2019s. The coworker apparently was dating this \\u2018terrible\\u2019 guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn\\u2019t know who the child\\u2019s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he\\u2019d be the best father for her child. \\n\\nNow my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He\\u2019s doing pretty bad now and I can\\u2019t help but feel guilty like I should\\u2019ve told him.\\n\\nEDIT: I didn\\u2019t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. \\n\\nOkay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I\\u2019m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I\\u2019ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). \\n\\nI don\\u2019t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn\\u2019t after everything that happened between us. They\\u2019re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should\\u2019ve. \\n\\nEDIT: So here\\u2019s what\\u2019s been happening right now, I haven\\u2019t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex\\u2019s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing \\u2018people who were never really family\\u2019 over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn\\u2019t biologically his, she\\u2019s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex\\u2018s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won\\u2019t contribute to that but he says that he\\u2019s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins).\"},{\"index\":325,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"I have a cousin by marriage (husband's cousin) that's 22 and dying of cancer.

This makes me really uncomfortable.\\n\\nIt's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.\\n\\nI'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby.

She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.\\n\\nI'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.\\n\\nI said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I \\\"popped them out so close together\\\".

While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:\\n\\nVT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...\\n\\nMe: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.\\n\\nVT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them.

I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.\\n\\nVT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.\\n\\nMe: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.\\n\\nVT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.\\n\\nMe: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?\\n\\nVT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.\\n\\nMe: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary.

I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).\\n4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated.

He will have a water.\\\" She then turned to him and said something along the lines of him not needing to drink because he was driving. He said no, the daughter could drive.

His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.\\n\\nIt's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. \\n\\nYesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.\\n\\nToday I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.\\n\\nTLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.\\n\\nEdit: to answer questions that people have been asking.\\n\\nYes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.\\n\\nYes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office.\"},{\"index\":410,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My sister and I have always been very different.

I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.\\n\\nWell, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is \\\"Harry Potter\\\" themed.\\n\\nDue to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.\\n\\nExcept the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said \\\"It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.\\\"\\n\\nI was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.\\n\\nI said \\\"I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.\\\"\\n\\nShe was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of \\\"chasing popularity and doing my nails\\\" maybe I would have more in common with them.\\n\\nI'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.\\n\\n**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars &amp; Harry Potter aren't the only geeky\\/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were \\\"too advanced\\\" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were \\\"dumb books for vapid little girls.\\\"\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky\\/nerdy!

I am overjoyed as I have always wanted a child of my own. I focused on my career in my life and since I am single, I wasn\\u2019t sure if having a baby would ever happen.\\n\\nI was excited to tell my family the big news. My older sister has one child, my nephew (7m). My brother is married but he and his wife have made it very clear they will always be child free.\\n\\nLast night we had a family dinner and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to share the news. Since this will be my only child I wanted to make it special and I also wanted to involve my nephew.\\n\\nI got a shirt that read \\u201cthis is what an awesome big cousin looks like\\u201d. I slipped away with my nephew before dinner and had a special moment with him while I told him he was going to have a cousin. \\n\\nMy nephew was very excited and put on the shirt. He put his sweater on over it and I told him he could take the sweater off whenever he wanted at dinner.\\n\\nIn the middle of dinner he took off the sweater and waited for someone to notice. Soon my sister jumped up and excitedly screamed when she saw the shirt.\\n\\nThey all then immediately assumed it was my sister in law. I wasn\\u2019t hurt my them assuming this and I kind of expected it because she is married.\\n\\nI was hurt because my sister in law didn\\u2019t try to correct them. She just went along with it and began to rub her flat belly while laughing. I must have looked completely hurt because my mother yelled at me to stop being rude and to congratulate them.\\n\\nI tried to explain that I was the one who gave my nephew the shirt. They all didn\\u2019t even hear me and just continued to fawn over my sister in law. My brother stood frozen in shock just asking his wife if she was serious.\\n\\nI got up and went home. I received multiple texts at this point from them telling me what an asshole I am for making this about me. They said things like it wasn\\u2019t my sister in laws fault that I was jealous. I didn\\u2019t reply to anything and just cried myself to sleep.\\n\\nThis morning my sister in law must have finally let it slip that she is not pregnant. They have now all called me to apologize saying that they just got caught up in the moment.\\n\\nThey said I shouldn\\u2019t have left the dinner and that it\\u2019s my fault I wasn\\u2019t clear enough that I was the one who is pregnant. My mom said I could have a redo dinner so I can get it right and they will all act surprised. \\n\\nMy sister in law sent me a message that said that the way I chose to announce was how she wanted to do it if she ever got pregnant. She said that since she is not ever having a child that she just wanted to experience what the moment would be like. She also said I can have my chance at the redo dinner. \\n\\nI told them no and that I will not be doing a redo. Every single person has now told me I am being selfish and an asshole because I won\\u2019t let them make it right.\\n\\nTo me there\\u2019s no fixing this. I will eventually forgive them but I don\\u2019t want to do a second announcement so they feel better.\\n\\nAITA?\"},{\"index\":432,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"My (20f) 2yo daughter has had a heart transplant due to CHD and is severely immune compromised, as a result she cannot recieve live virus vaccines.\\n\\nI'm in a young mom's group on Facebook and the topic of daycares and being a SAHM came up.

The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.\\n\\nWe were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'\\n\\nHe replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.\\n\\nWe didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'\\n\\nI was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.\\n\\nHe told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??\\n\\nHe screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.\\n\\nI tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.\\n\\nI'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. \\n\\nHis mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who took the time to respond.

My cousin would make fun of me whenever I call my pets \\\"family\\\" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot\\/terminator\\/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection *2 years ago.\\n\\nI been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. So Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes\\/my phone\\/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.\\n\\nI saw that it was gone in the morning (*he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. \\n\\nHe realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank \\\"bro\\\" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue \\\"family\\\" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out.

I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I\\u2019m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.\\n\\n1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it\\u2019s weird).\\n\\n2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?\\n\\n3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?\\n\\n4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman\\u2019s history with her father? \\n\\n5. What\\u2019s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?\\n\\nI know, I\\u2019m not the girl\\u2019s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). \\n\\nSo, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I\\u2019m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. \\n\\nAfter only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is \\u201cNone of my business.\\u201d I got a little pissed at that. \\n\\nI told him he\\u2019s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I\\u2019m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him \\u201cuncomfortable\\u201d. I replied that I\\u2019m uncomfortable having a dude who\\u2019s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you\\u2019re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.\\n\\nWell, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it\\u2019s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.\\n\\nSo Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?\\n\\nEDIT: some info:\\n\\nI asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got \\u201cuncomfortable\\u201d.\\n\\nI would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. \\n\\nWhen I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.\\n\\nI would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.\\n\\nEdit 2: Some of you here asked what\\u2019s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They\\u2019re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.\\n\\nFINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn\\u2019t have a problem. \\n\\nTalked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. \\n\\nAsked why they broke up.\\n\\nThe guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him.\"},{\"index\":377,\"label\":0,\"text\":\"8 years ago, my (29f) sister (32f) got pregnant. The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.\\n\\nWhen Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.\\n\\nWhen I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.\\n\\nMy sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.\\n\\nShe keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.\\n\\nWe had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said \\\"auntie keeps turning the wifi off\\\". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.\\n\\nWhen we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone \\\"forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter\\\" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.\\n\\nSince leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused.

I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of \\\"fun\\\" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in \\\"acceptable\\\" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.\\n\\nAs a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the \\\"green\\\" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make \\\"cheese\\\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.\\n\\nIt was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was \\\"unethical\\\" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?\\n\\n**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out.

I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up.

This post has really blown up but anyway...**\\n\\n**\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Content warning: Transphobia\\\\*\\\\*\\\\***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy husband is a transgender man and we've always wanted to start a family together. I have a huge fear of pregnancy so he offered to carry the baby. It was an insane process. He had to stop taking testosterone for a long time but he was amazing throughout the whole process and I did everything in my power to help him feel more comfortable.\\n\\nNone of my family know that he is transgender (homophobic, transphobic, all the phobics), but our friends know. He posted an ultrasound to his private instagram, not knowing that my sister follows him on a burner account. Well, she saw the photo and told my whole family. They were FURIOUS that I wouldn't tell them (our plan was to say we adopted). They assumed I was the one pregnant and blew up on me, so I just let it go and rolled with the lie because I wasn't going to out my husband.\\n\\nThe first couple of months I'd let them visit, eventually I'd start eating big meals and purposely bloating myself to the point of discomfort so I looked pregnant. They'd remark around the 6 month mark that I was remarkably small but I just played it off. Eventually I couldn't lie any longer, so I looked for every excuse in the book to not see my family. I turned down the offers of baby showers, gender reveal parties, anything that would require us seeing each other. Luckily my family live an hour away and we all live busy lifestyles, so them randomly visiting wasn't an issue. The one time they did pop in unexpectedly, we were out of the house. If they Facetimed, I made a point to be in bed feeling horribly sick so I couldn't give a \\\"bump update\\\". I lied my ass off and they just thought I had a rough pregnancy.\\n\\nMy husband gave birth a year ago and went straight back on the testosterone, and now we're happy as ever. My family have met our daughter and they adore her.\\n\\nA week ago, after an argument between myself and a friend, said friend decided to out my husband by messaging my family and included proof. They did it by adding everybody to a group chat, posting screenshots and basically the whole story, then saying \\\"I'll leave you all to discuss\\\", then they left the chat and blocked me and my husband.\\n\\nIn a transphobic rage, my mother raced to my home and all but beat my front door down. It wasn't pretty. I had to call the cops. I've been disowned, but that hasn't stopped the daily calls and texts coming from my parents, aunts, uncles, siblings etc., leaving nasty transphobic slurs on my voicemail and other hateful crap.\\n\\nI ended up crying to my friend yesterday who told me that I should have been honest with my family, as it would've saved me a lot of heart ache. That, or said we miscarried and then adopted later. I'm not happy that things played out the way they did. I just feel so sad now. Maybe it was wrong to lie to my family, but I feel like I had no choice.\\n\\n**Edit, because I figured I'd put this in the main text:**\\n\\nMy husband has always encouraged me to maintain a relationship with my family however it was mostly for his sake. Personally, I mentally checked out years ago. But when they met him, they welcomed him with open arms and treated him like a son. Yes, it was conditional on him being presumed cisgender, however we never intended for them to find out. He felt a familial love that he's never had from his own family before, which is why I kept my relationship with my parents at his request. If it weren't for him, I most likely would have cut them off a long time ago. I'm sad that this has happened, but most of that sadness is for my husband rather than for me.\\n\\nAlso the friend in this story who outed him is obviously no longer a friend, and never will be again. The other friend who said I should've told the truth is on thin ice.\\n\\n**Another edit: Y'all are making us ugly cry.

I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.\\n\\nYesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place.

The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.\\n\\nA few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified \\\"not formal\\\" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.\\n\\nWas I in the wrong?\\n\\nEdit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.\\n\\nEdit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later.

I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something.

My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.\\n\\nI got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25\\/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.\\n\\nI fucking screamed \\\"What the hell are you doing?!\\\" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.\\n\\nAfter I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that \\\"ugly ass\\\" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.\\n\\nBlack Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99\\/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.\\n\\nI asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned \\\"Get the fuck out of my house. Now.\\\" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste.

It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an \\\"honest mistake\\\" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.\\n\\n**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said \\\"You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that.\\\" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.\\n\\n**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc!

I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to \\\"toughen\\\" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.\\n\\nWhen my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet \\\"hooks\\\" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.\\n\\nAfter that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.\\n\\nWhen I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.\\n\\nMy dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just \\\"toughen\\\" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?\\n\\nEdit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not \\\"needles.\\\" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a \\\"needle.\\\" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.\\n\\nEdit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of \\/harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas.

I didn't know what he meant so I asked \\\"what was what?\\\". Boyfriend then said that there was absolutely no need for me to correct Co-worker and that it's better if people think I'm his wife. I said I'm not his wife, I'm his girlfriend, and he never told me that he told other people that I'm his wife.\\n\\nThis somehow becomes an argument, with my side being that Boyfriend never told me that his co-workers think we're married, and Boyfriend's side being that I should have figured that being called his wife indicated that Co-worker thought I was his wife and I shouldn't have corrected him, and when I said I thought he'd just made an assumption, Boyfriend said that wasn't the point, the point was that there was no need to correct him, that it was rude, and that it make Boyfriend look like a dickhead.\\n\\nHe then said that the solution to this is that when he next has a video call with Co-worker, he wants me to come in again, strike up a conversation, and say that I was messing with him, and that Boyfriend is actually Husband and us not being married is an inside joke I thought Co-worker was in on.\\n\\nI then said that was the dumbest fucking plan he'd ever come up with, and \\\"no fucking way am I doing that\\\", and he said I was being an arsehole, that I got him into this, and now I have to bail him out.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: We talked.

They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.\\n\\nJosh, now almost 13, has been calling me \\\"dad\\\" and my wife \\\"mum\\\" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.\\n\\nSome of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me \\\"dad\\\" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.\\n\\nI discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the \\\"father figure\\\" everyone deserves.\\n\\nI feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?\\n\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying \\\"sooner than later\\\".

I asked BF about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim.

So he usually isn't home for 4 days and then comes home for 3 days. One day, Claire asked my BF if she can drop off Alex for the day. BF was supposed to leave for work that evening. Since she had said that she will pick up the baby by evening, he didn't mention that. Big mistake. He left around 5 pm. \\n\\nI was waiting for Claire and kept calling her. She picked up the phone around 8 pm and told me that she went to a place few hours away with her friends. She told me to tell BF to take care of Alex for next 3-4 days. I told her that BF already left for work. Then she just told me \\\"Then you take care of Alex. I will back in 4 days.\\\" And then she hung up on me and switched off her phone. \\n\\nI freaked out hard. I cannot call BF because he is unreachable onsite. Neither of us have family in the state that we could have called. I called few friends but no one gave me anything helpful. The bag she gave with Alex only had diapers left in it.

She probably just brought enough for her and her friends for the next few days). She didn't get any jail time. She had to do community service and plead guilty. Unfortunately, that also meant she got a felony conviction.

The students come to the hospital where I work and I teach them by doing direct patient care. They also have written assignments to complete, some for me in the clinical setting and some in the classroom. Most of the students I have are seniors, so college work is not new to them. \\n\\nThis semester I have a student who just has a lack of motivation and puts in little effort. Her assignments are usually submitted late, but there is nothing in the syllabus that states they can\\u2019t be turned in late for full credit \\ud83d\\ude44 The students are also allowed to redo one failed assignment for full credit. She failed her first assignment and I have reminded her throughout the term that she has to redo it because it\\u2019s a required assignment to pass the course. \\n\\nShe shows up exactly on time or 2-3 minutes late for class. Their syllabus states that they must be on time for the clinical portion of class (that I teach) or they will be sent home and their absence unexcused. I have not kicked her out when she\\u2019s been 2-3 minutes late because it just seems petty. She has also missed a couple of classes that had to be made up with other clinical experiences to get her required hours. I\\u2019ve discussed this with her course professor and also with the student in her midterm evaluation. \\n\\nShe missed her second to last clinical and I reminded her that she would have to complete that final assignment at her last clinical to pass. She assured me she would. I had a conversation with her classroom professor who has also been frustrated with the student this term. She had just finally turned in an assignment that was 3 weeks late. I was annoyed by that because she ended up getting the same grade as students who completed it on time. Next semester the syllabus will specify points lost for late assignments. This hasn\\u2019t historically been an issue. \\n\\nHer course professor had a conversation with her in class last week about her final clinical and that assignment absolutely having to pass or she fails the course. On the last day of clinical, all the students were there, dressed in scrubs, ready for patient rounds, on time. Except this student who walked in 3 minutes late and not dressed. I said \\u201cYou are late and you are not ready. This is unprofessional. You need to leave immediately.\\u201d \\n\\nSo, my making her leave means she fails the course because there is no other chance to make it up and it\\u2019s final exam week. It also means it delays her graduation by at least one semester because she will have to retake that course and can\\u2019t take a course next term that needs this one as a pre-req. At the time I felt very justified in sending her home. She\\u2019s been given several warnings and multiple breaks with late work. But now I\\u2019m feeling kind of like I might have been an asshole in kicking her out knowing it guaranteed her course failure when I\\u2019ve let her stay when she was late in the past.

At first I said \\u201cBe careful of your time!\\u201d Then a more stern \\u201cWe start on time, you need to be dressed and ready to go by the start of clinical.\\u201d But I was trying not to be a total hard ass over 2 minutes. At midterm I had to do a written evaluation of each student. I put on there that she was often tardy and needed to be on time. Those go in her file. I also filed an Academic Improvement Plan which discussed her tardiness to clinical and those failed assignments. The AIP outlines future expectations which included being on time and turning in assignments. The AIP stays in her file and goes to her academic advisor. At that time I told her she had to be on time and ready for clinical, or the next tine she would be sent home.\\n\\nEDIT 2:\\nHoly cow, I shut my phone off for a couple of hours to go see a movie and this is exploding!!

I don\\u2019t care what their gender is, just do your freaking work. \\n\\nAnd for the people saying I\\u2019m TA because why does 2-3 minutes make a difference? You clearly have no idea what rounds are like in a hospital. At the time it begins you have doctors, nurses, residents, students, possibly case managers, social workers, etc, who assemble in a group to present each patient\\u2019s case. Every one of them is ready to go. At our hospital, an overhead announcement is made 10 minutes before rounds start so that everyone gets their shit together and is ready. I\\u2019ve told my students it\\u2019s best to arrive about 10-15 min early so they can be changed in hospital scrubs and in the group ready to go. Nobody is waiting 2-3 minutes for a student to catch up. And you can be damn sure nobody is waiting 10 minutes for a student who came in late and wasn\\u2019t dressed.\\n\\nFINAL EDIT: Wow, I really didn\\u2019t expect this to garner so many comments! I tried really hard to read all of them and answer the ones asking for more info. I thought it would be easiest to update the most frequently asked questions here. \\n\\nYes, I did attempt to find out what was going on in her personal life. I\\u2019m not an ogre. I wanted to help her and would have been willing to help her in any way I could if she\\u2019d given me anything I could work with. Her tardiness was typically the result of staying out too late and sleeping as late as possible. The incomplete and late assignments were the result of failing another course and focusing more on bringing her grade up there. So I tried being flexible on both to keep her sane, which evidently was not what I should have done. \\n\\nShe did not fail because she was late for class. She had a required assignment 3 months ago that she failed. She put the redo off for 3 months. The day before her final clinical practicum she was advised that it was her last chance to complete it and that she had to be on time and prepared because she was on a final written warning for tardiness. Her failing grade comes from not completing a required assignment. \\n\\nI do not know if she has ADHD. I will keep that in mind in the future if I see this again. \\n\\nI have requested that the course professor edit the syllabus next term to include a clause for late assignments. It\\u2019s not my syllabus to write. I don\\u2019t teach in the classroom. \\n\\nDue to a lot of comments I\\u2019ve read, I now realize that I need to be more of a hard ass in enforcing attendance rules and wasn\\u2019t doing anyone any favors trying to be lenient. So, in the future I will allow the one tardy with a warning. Second time I will send them home. \\n\\nThank you everyone for your feedback! I really was conflicted over it. I felt like since I have her a final written warning saying her next tardy resulted in her being sent home, she needed to be sent home. I just struggled a bit because of it being her last chance to complete her assignment. But you\\u2019ve all made me realize that it was her choice and she was aware of those consequences. I appreciate all of your comments, no matter how you voted. It helped me to look deeper at what I was doing and what I will do in the future.\"}]"
