I had eczema for basically my whole life and never really bothered but recently my dad has been more invested in getting rid of it. He says \"that it's ugly\" and make me put on this weird oil on. It never bothered me it was just annoying.\n  But recently he started saying that I supposedly hate myself since I don't take care of my skin. A direct quote is \"I love you but you must not love yourself.\" When he was talking about my skin. No parents should say that to child. But I guess you could said that he trying to help me take care of myself with some tough love and I'm the jerk because don't take care of my skin.\n  But still feel like he shouldn't telling me that my skin is ugly and stuff. I really want to if I'm just overreacting or not."

            "text": "So background - my aunt owns a small business that makes jewelry and accessories (she uses threads , beads and stuff not gold or gemstones). \n\nMy friends and I (16M at that time) decided to a secret santa during Christmas 2019 . I had to give a gift to a girl from my class (Elle) . I chose this blue and white tassle earings for her from my aunt's collection . A day before the secret santa my mom visited my aunt (for other reasons) , she paid for the earings and got them for me . I opened them and I saw that they weren't earrings but instead a necklace with a stone in it (the necklace threads made a net sort of thing for the stone to be placed in) I immediately knew my friend won't like it as she just wouldn't wear it with her fashion sense and age . But it was too late now and my mom said it would be ok. It wasn't.\n\nEveryone in the secret sants laughed at it and I felt humiliated , Elle even asked ,\"what is this?\" as she was genuinely confused. She apologized in person the next day in front of everyone. I was livid and I lost my cool and shouted at my aunt saying that I asked for a specific set of earrings and she gave me a random necklace she outsourced from china and couldn't sell (true story as I have helped her with her buisness). She shouted back and called me disrespectful and my mother told me to let it be. It was humiliating although none of my friends ever said anything about it after that.\n\nYesterday was my girlfriend's birthday and I bought her a jewellery set from a gift shop which she loved as it fit her fashion sense perfectly . My aunt called me and asked why I didn't by jewellery for my girlfriend from her , she said that she thought we were over the secret santa incident . I said that she was good to me as an aunt and person so I respect her but professionally she betrayed me and it was a breach of trust. She's ignoring me now and even my mother is siding with my aunt. \n\nTL:DR- I asked my aunt for earrings to gift for a secret santa she gave me a random necklace , I stopped buying from her,  she's ignoring me"

And I asked if it was cool for me to stay there so we can hang out and do something on Saturday. My dad said that would be great. He seemed happy about it so I thought that was the plan. I made the drive got there by Friday night and slept on the couch at his place. My dad has a wife and they have my little brother (6). Saturday morning my stepmom is saying me and my bro should go to the beach or something fun out of the house. But I told her well my dad and I had plans to have some guy time. My brother could come tho no problem. \nShe said they had plans already. When I talked to my dad he said he was sorry. My stepmom got all excited after he told her I was coming. She thought this would be great time for them to go out. Guess they were gonna do a spa day, go out to eat then movies. It was gonna take the whole day. My dad though we could do something together on Sunday. But Sunday was literally when I was leaving. Probably have like 2 hours to spend time together before I needed to be on the road.  I got pretty mad at him, I told him I didn\u2019t drive for hours to babysit. Whole point of coming out was to spend time with him. He kept saying he\u2019s sorry, my stepmom just jumped at it and he doesn\u2019t want her feeling bad. Then she got involved with I should be happy to spend time with my brother. Especially with me staying at their house \u201cfor free.\u201d \n\nWell I told my dad no point in me staying if we\u2019re only gonna have a couple hours to hangout. So I just got my stuff and made the drive back home. She thinks I was a huge asshole now for being bratty instead of doing something nice for them. And they couldn\u2019t even got out after I left. I was mad when I left because of the change of plans with literally no warning but idk if I was an asshoel for basically doing the same thing to them and refusing to babysit my brother so they could have their time. To me it just wasn\u2019t fair to waste all my time there when I wasn\u2019t gonna be able to do what I went there to do. AITA?"

            "text": "I (23M) was forced out of my college's chapter of a co-ed fraternity just before my graduation. I had been in this frat for 3 years. Most of my college friends came from it and I spent many hours each week participating. I was a shy, lonely guy before I joined and it helped make me much more sociable.\n\nThough things changed last fall. It was recruitment season and I really hit it off with this potential member (21F). She was very cute and we talked a lot, even inviting her to my place to hang out. We had a deep conversation about our personal lives and she even opened up to me about a medical condition she had affecting her reproductive system. To lighten the mood I made an inappropriate joke about it. She laughed it off and we kept talking.\n\nFast forward to last April. This potential member was inducted and we maintained our friendship, but we never hung out privately after that night. That month I heard from a mutual friend that she was upset at me for something but she didn't tell our friend what exactly. I texted her later to find out.\n\nOnly then did I learn how much the joke I made last year upset her. She noted other times I made off-putting comments such as when I tried to compliment her by saying that I find \"conventionally unattractive\" women like her beautiful. She also said she caught me staring at her chest several times. I was shocked and ashamed because I never realized how obvious I was. I apologized profusely and took complete ownership of what I did. She accepted my apology and, to show that bygones were bygones, she invited me to a party at her apartment.\n\nIt was a Friday night and I and a bunch of other frat members went to the party. I quickly made myself at home. My ex (21F), a former frat member, showed up later that night. By then I was totally drunk and got upset when I saw her since we didn't break up on good terms. I noticed the member who invited me and my ex were talking a lot. So I thought it would be funny to spread a rumor about them sleeping together to a friend. I quickly realized that that friend (22M) was the chapter president.\n\nThe following Monday, we had a private talk and he gave me a choice: leave the frat immediately or be investigated by the chapter's executive board. I chose to leave. I was devastated and disgusted with myself but cooperated fully, hoping I could still do the right thing. I lost a few friends plus my girlfriend at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, I was awaiting a decision from the university on my application for a second degree. A couple weeks after I left the frat, I posted my acceptance letter online. The chapter prez/my friend DM'd me saying it wasn't a good idea to come back. I was surprised. The school was huge and I had already promised not to try rejoining the chapter. Still, he worried I might run into the member I had hurt. I said I'd think it over. I didn't want to cause further issues nor risk alienating myself more so I withdrew my application.\n\nSo I ask WIBTA if I decided to return to my school?"

Me already knowing a lot about NYC decided to help her take transit and showed her around the nightlife. (For background, we have about 5-7 friends in our shared Airbnb) and we are all exploring the city by ourselves. One issue that started, was that my best friend refused to learn the transit herself and always joined in on my plans because I knew where I was going. I decided that was okay and didn\u2019t mind, but because this was \u201chot girl summer\u201d she tends to get very intoxicated and I have to look after her always. Well this one occasion, I let her know please be careful there\u2019s uneven ground at the place we\u2019re going and please don\u2019t be too intoxicated because you may fall. She decides to ignore all my advice and falls down a step and sprains her ankle. I offer to get her an Uber because she didn\u2019t want to go out anymore but I was still showing my other friends around but she was highly offended at that notation. So I doubled down and decided, all of us will end out nights and head back. Another issue that started was, as we all decided to head back (note there\u2019s six of us) she from my phone only called a regular Uber instead of a bigger one since she said we were leaving her which we weren\u2019t anymore. So half of us were split which is okay but kinda just bugged me. As she\u2019s getting in the Uber, she wants all of us to change our plans for the next couple of days to accommodate her recent injury as some of our activity will include pressure on her injury. I respectfully asked if she could sit out on them since, they\u2019ve been already paid for? AITA"

She then texted and said it will be waiting outside her house in a bag because she doesn't want to see me, and she still wants me to pay her.

Well, my friend came running up to me and my boyfriend as we were leaving, and started to rip off our wristbands. This was mine and my boyfriends first fair together, so I wanted to keep the wristbands as a memory. So I try to pull away and tell her no, but she takes them off anyways. So she could ride rides with a few cute guys, and the guys couldn\u2019t afford the wristband. I told her fine but she had to give them back. She comes back to my place later that night, high off her ass, and I ask her for the wristbands back. She said she forgot them, I was pissed. And come to find out she never got those guys numbers, so she couldn\u2019t get them back. I was pissed and crying because those bands meant a lot to me. I told her if she was going to be that irresponsible, then she can pay me back for what she took. I have never been so angry and sad at the same time.

A few months ago, I brought up the idea of getting a dog as I have been going through a lot mentally (depression, anxiety and an ed). I have always been a dog lover. I usually would spend time with my best friends, but lately, we have not been on the best of terms (I can further go into specifics later). My partner also moved away last year.\n\nRecently, I found out that my coworker\u2019s brother\u2019s dogs had puppies. I immediately thought about my best friend because this was her favourite breed and texted her the breeder's contact right away. As the day went on, I thought about how this was the perfect opportunity to get myself a puppy. I had told my friend this and spoke to the breeder. The breeder said there were plenty of pups. After deep thought, I decided I wanted a brown male one. I had expressed this with my friend and she became upset as this was the kind of puppy she wanted. She stated she has always wanted this dog and that I should have known. She brought up my parent\u2019s dog and shamed me for wanting to get a puppy when I technically already have my parent\u2019s dog. She stated that getting a puppy would be upsetting for my parent\u2019s dog. My parent\u2019s dog is older and nearing end of life. I brought up that I thought it would be nice to have a companion with how things have been mentally/emotionally. I told her she can have the brown male puppy and I would be happy to have any. Cut to finding out, there were actually two brown male puppies, so both of us would have one. Happy ending right? Not exactly.\n\nWe later visited the puppies separately. She visited the puppies first and sent photos of them to the group chat. Everyone responded super excited for her, including me. One asked which one she wanted and she said she did not want to choose right away. I then visited the puppies days later and sent photos to the chat. I stated I loved the bigger brown one, but would wait until my friend chose first. The girls all responded and told me I should wait until my friend chooses first. I reiterated that I would wait until my friend picked first. They all then proceeded to tell me why my friend deserved to have this puppy (i.e. she has always wanted this type of dog and this was her first dog with her husband). I again told them I was fine with any puppy, but also asked why my reason to have the dog was not being considered as well. I messaged my friend separately to apologize and stated this was being blown out of proportion, but she then told me I was terrible for using my mental health to one up her. I ended up not getting a dog from my coworker's brother as I didn't want to cause any further issues. Instead, I got a dog elsewhere of the same breed, but different colour/female. When I told my friend this, she was even more irate and told me I was a terrible friend. She wants me to return the dog, but my pup and I have already formed an attachment. I do not know what to do at this point."

Several of my siblings have smaller children and one sibling will ask me to help watch the children while their partner is at work or vice-versa. I have also come to help with random homework assignments, picking up their mobile orders, or things around the home. I have also given rides to the airport when needed. No big deal. One of my siblings has considered hiring a babysitter/nanny and I offered to make myself available on my off days to help as much as i can (free of charge). My sibling is kind of an A-type personality and they expressed how their children might be too much for me to help that much. Completely understood. However, I would make myself available whenever needed after that conversation. Seeing as I had no further commitment on the babysitter/nanny thing, I put in a request for multiple days of overtime on my off days for the next few months. I'm currently trying to save as much as I can for expenses, a possible move, etc. My brother-in-law then asked if I could help them on a day that I put in my request for. My job usually gives me all of the hours I put in for so I said, \"I might not be able to as I put in a request for overtime. If i don't get the day, I'll help.\" He said they hired a nanny but they're trying to save money on random days. He then asked if I could cancel it as my sibling brought that option up. I said I did not want to cancel it as I made a commitment to work a specific amount of hours for the following months. My brother-in-law said he was working and my sibling needs to be able to attend a Zoom meeting so they would need someone to watch the children for several hours. I said I would rather wait until I hear back from management before committing. He then said to \"forget it, we'll figure it out.\"\n\nThe next day, I get a group message with him and my sibling about how rude i was to not cancel overtime to help them. I explained my part and said I only wanted to see what part of my schedule was approved. They then went on about how I should have just cancelled it to help them. They also expressed how they want to move out of state and based on my behavior \"it doesn't seem like it matters if we moved now.\" The conversation went on for a while and they said my behavior showed them I don't care about them, their career, or anything else.

He isn\u2019t an energetic dog, but he\u2019ll play and swim when I participate with him.He\u2019s been taught not to jump on furniture, and refuses to even jump into my car(I have to lift him). \n\nStill, one of my roommates demands that he can\u2019t move in until AFTER her birthday(3weeks away).She says it\u2019s because her cat and the other roomies dogs haven\u2019t been socialized together.We are halfway through our lease next week.If they were going to socialize their animals together, it would have happened by now. \n\nMy roommates think I\u2019m rushing this and forcing them into something\u2014which I can understand, but I wasn\u2019t even planning this to happen yet myself! I told the old owner that I wanted to meet at least one more time, with my roommate and her dogs.But the Aussie was dumped on me.\n\nI did all the things my roomies asked(I waited two more months instead of one, and he\u2019s an adult, neutered dog).PLUS I\u2019ve been jumping through hoops, moving my work equipment and the dog from place to place, to accommodate the new \u201cafter my birthday\u201d rule.So, AITA??"

            "text": "we live in the same city. I am estranged from my parents, we have always had a difficult relationship I went no contact with my parents about three years ago after we had a fight about if I was ever going to marry someone. They accused me of sleeping with men. Being a degenerate and some other accusations which were not true at all. \n\nIt had been a long time coming as they had always disapproved of me pursuing a stressful career which left me not time to have children and be a good wife. These are things I don't want. I have no interest in  sexual relationship or having children. I have tried to explain those things are not I wanted in my life but they never believed me at all. It was stressful and made me deeply unhappy. \n\nHonestly, the last three years have been the happiest in my life. My parents make me deeply unhappy about myself and they make my self esteem issue worse. No contact has been the best thing that I ever did. \n\nI was going to small party hosted by my best friend. I was half way there when my brother called and told me that dad was sick and was being taken to the hospital. I told him that I was busy and asked him if wanted money and told him I would send some money the next day. he was fine with it. \n\nThis party was pretty best friend and her husband had been struggling to have get pregnant and she had miscarried once before. It absolutely broke them but she is pregnant now and the doc said the risk of miscarriage was mostly past and they wanted to tell our little band of friends. I wanted to be there for her and yeah pandemic has not been easy for any of us. I really wanted to make some happy memories. \n\nMy brother called me next day and he called me cold hearted for not coming over to be there with dad and called me ungrateful. I think he saw the stories one of my friend posted. I feel guilty now. I should have gone. I think. I am his daughter and he does care for me in his own way. I just decided on the spot I would rather be with my best friend that my family. I feel it a bit of  a selfish decision."

Basically, sharing and giving some of your salary. I'm cool with sharing and giving some of my hard earned cash to my family since we have alot of debts to pay, and I understand that.\n\nThing is, my income isn't that great and I also have goals that I want to achieve that involves money, so I am saving money (I want to marry my girlfriend). So a few months ago, I created an excel sheet to monitor my expenses and justify how much was being spent on the family and how much is left for me and my savings. Since I can monitor the expenses, there are times when I just couldn't give the amount of money we agreed upon due to the fixed expenses that I have to pay (I have life insurance and a huge outstanding balance in college that they didn't monitor so now I'm the one paying for it) and extra expenses that my family asks for when we agree to go out for dinner or I buy them stuff. I can't help it, I am the eldest child and I want them to experience cool things.\n\nIt just hurts me when they call me stingy or frugal when I don't want or don't agree on spending on items or experiences they want (but I end up buying things for them sometimes), I just want to save some money y'know?. \n\nWhen I don't give the agreed amount they would say things to me like \"what am I gonna do with this? this is just for gas?, you're just thinking about yourself and you do not love your family!, you know our situation but you're being selfish or don't be selfish, atleast you have some savings, we don't!\" which hurts a lot.\n\nNow that I have a new big opportunity, they are expecting me to give atleast half, I agreed to it, ONLY AND IF ONLY they use it to pay debts or else I won't.\n\nI know they have their own perspective and side of the coin about this but I just wanted to vent out.\n\nAITA if I don't want to share my salary?"

My father left when I was 3, he didn't cut contact, we could still talk to him, just not in person. So what has recently happened, is I made a deal with him, that I'd  work on improving some stuff (that I'm not comfortable repeating) and he'd pay for an Xbox one, as the one I bought before that was broken, wouldn't turn on. Now, one of these things he wanted me to improve was contact, and that meant he wanted to call me daily. I wasn't ok with this, I said he could text me whenever he'd like, I don't care. He went on a rant about how I don't love him and want nothing to do with him and I only talk to him when I need something, which is grotesquely wrong. The thing is, I'm ok with calling people close to me, like close family and friends, but he's not in that group, hes missed out on most of my life, I don't know him all that well, I've only met him twice in 12 years. I hope this sums up the situation, there's a bug in the back of my head, I think I missed something, but anyway....\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to call my dad?"

I saw my dad on his own a few times as he was doing stuff with my brother and/or other family.\n\nThis was brought to my attention when they flew home. And my dad is pissed that I made his wife feel this way, so let me explain.\n\nShe claims I didn't make her feel welcome while she was here. She actually claims me and my brother both made he feel that way but dad said he was dealing with us individually. She said whenever she was around she felt unwanted, like she was there just because of him and not become she's our stepmother of 20 years. He mentioned specific incidents where she was around but wasn't invited to take part in things (mom and I running to pick up the cake after the bakery were late, brother and I taking our mom to dinner two days before the wedding). Another one was she found out my mom and I got ready at my house and I knew she wasn't with my dad but never tried to include her. He told me it was a disgusting way to treat her.\n\nI won't deny those things happened but I also don't have the relationship they want me to have with her. My relationship with her changed after I found out she hated my mom. I can't remember exactly what age I was but I know she would stop hiding how she felt about my mom. How she felt she was rude and unfair to her because she wouldn't include her equally in parenting decisions. She was jealous that my brother and I were so close to her and only called her mom. So she would drop these feelings about our mom or these supposed terrible things to try and get sympathy and win us. The most bizarre and annoying one for me was when I was 12, my mom chose to do a Mother's Day thing with me, my brother and our grandma and great grandma who was alive at the time. She tried to convince me/us that it was an asshole move on her part that she didn't invite her and even went as far as to say she had agreed to give her Mother's Day with us for the first time. I don't believe it for a second but she mentioned it. Then when I was 15 my dad's job took him out of town for a couple off months and she was hurt I didn't continue going over there every other week. She was even more hurt I didn't go there at all. But why would I with the crap she pulled.\n\nSo that's the background and I feel like it makes sense that we're not all over her and we might not be as inclusive as they would like. My dad knows all this too. He always said he would deal with it/had dealt with it and we should move on. But apparently he thinks that means going out of our way to welcome her when my brother and I can just about tolerate her presence or his sake.\n\nAITA?"

Let\u2019s call her Beth(20F). Beth is an idiot. I had to show her how to turn on the oven. Take out trash. Clean a bathroom. She doesn\u2019t clean her room and is basically a giant child. Now we get to the actual AITA situation. \n\nToday she \u201casks\u201d me if it\u2019s ok if she can bring over a puppy to babysit from 4pm-1am today and that she is going to go pick it up soon. She already agreed to it but didn\u2019t realize they meant for her to take care of it at my apartment and not their house. I didn\u2019t want to be an asshole so I said yeah sure. The puppy arrives and it is a 9w GSD and NOT POTTY TRAINED. \n\nBeth asks \u201cwhat do I do because it\u2019s not potty trained and it\u2019s your apartment\u201d.  My apartment is all carpet except bathrooms and the kitchen area. I tell her basically take the dog out often and keep a close eye on it. If it pees you are cleaning it up. Well the puppy pees in the kitchen pretty soon but it\u2019s an easy fix. She asks me how to clean it. I have to show her how to put a swifter pad on a mop because apparently she has never mopped before because she had housekeepers growing up. I leave to go to a friends and here is where the big issue starts. \n\nI come back later after the dog is already gone. I turn on the lights and there is a huge puddle of piss on the kitchen floor and on the carpet. I text her come here and clean it up now because she is in the room with her door closed. Here is where I might be the asshole. When she came to clean it I handed her the swifter and said \u201cwhat the fuck dude how did you miss this, you were supposed to be watching the dog. Clean this up and tomorrow you can clean the carpet pee spot because I do not have the time or the energy to teach you how to tonight\u201d and walked away to get ready for bed. I know I could\u2019ve been nicer but I was PISSED. \n\nShe texts me and basically we have a text conversation where she tells me not to talk to her in that tone and that my feelings are valid but not an excuse to belittle someone and that I need to talk in a civilized manner next time I have an issue.She also said she\u2019s having one do the worst nights she\u2019s had in a while because of family issues. Doesn\u2019t apologize or admit any fault. I tell her no more dogs, I did not mean to make her feel bad but I don\u2019t want to have to tell her to do this kind of stuff. \n\nI get that accidents happen but she consistently does not use any critical thinking skills and does not know how to figure things out on her own. But on the other hand her texts made me feel like I was an ass for getting mad at her and I could\u2019ve handled better. \n\nSo Reddit am I the asshole? \n\nTldr: summer subletter brings home a surprise puppy to babysit. It pees on the floor and she doesn\u2019t clean it up so I tell her to and she tells me I belittled her and was uncivilized."

Then she walks past me and says, \u201cOh by the way, your niece has a similar infection to you, but on her vagina , but don\u2019t worry it wasn\u2019t the same as yours\u201d and walked off. My niece is a toddler by the way.\n\nMy Mom isn\u2019t the best with words, she might mean well but just blurt stuff out without context or whatever and at times can be blunt. Anyway I just found it odd, firstly I\u2019m her Uncle, why would you be telling me about issues she\u2019s having with her private parts just out of the blue, it was very random. Maybe I overreacted but I thought , \u201cis she implying that I passed it onto her?\u201d\u2026 given it\u2019s contagious etc. \n\nI left it, but then it started to bother me and I just needed to clear the air. I went to my Mom and asked in a very non-aggressive manner why she told me all that stuff earlier, she got defensive and annoyed instantly. I just explained that it\u2019s not overreacting to interpret what she said the wrong way , she disagrees and said I\u2019m being too sensitive. and now it\u2019s awkward.\n\nIn hindsight I think in her own way she was trying to be nice. When this infection was at its worst I relayed concerns to her around passing it on to other family members and having to be careful, so it was a weird way of reassuring me maybe.\n\nAITA?"

However this didn\u2019t happen overnight as it took me endless amounts of sleepless nights and stress over a year. I had rejection after rejection and I must have applied to hundreds but I finally did it.\n\nMy friend (22F) has had a lot of trouble finding a job after graduation but I\u2019ve been so open with helping her because she\u2019s been very supportive in my life. I used to intern at a prior company that I knew was looking for more interns in another department and I nudged her to apply because I thought she would be a good fit and she didn\u2019t have any real experience and she was desperately looking for experience. She didn\u2019t really vibe with the company but she needed experience on her resume and she got it! I was very happy with her because it was an amazing opportunity. This company told me pretty early on they were not going to give me a full time offer so I made to keep looking for other jobs so I could have one lined up after graduation. \n\nMy friend\u2019s internship with this company is about to end and they will also not give her a full time. However, she has not been looking at all because she feels too tired to even apply and feels frustrated which I understand since the job market is tough. She asked me if my company was hiring and if I would be willing to give her a referral. I told her that\u2019s great because I would be happy working with her and help her on her resume. She asked what my role was so she could apply to it as well. \n\nIt made me feel weird she doesn\u2019t know what my company did or what I did but automatically wanted a referral. I told her what I did and what the interview process was like and it\u2019s a series of interviews + take home analysis test + logic test. She said she\u2019s not ready or doesn\u2019t know how to get ready for these tests. I have a list of resources I used to study but she said it was too much. I just said ok maybe you should apply for something else since there are other roles in the company or not apply for this company. She said why don\u2019t I just help her on the tests but I feel like giving her the referral is enough since it\u2019ll propel her application to the top of the pile. She doesn\u2019t want the other roles due to fit but she asked for a referral to my role without even knowing about it. I feel everything else should be on her own and if she gets it it won\u2019t be because of my help but because of her own ability. But it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to put in the extra work to study or build her own ability even though I had to during my application season on top of my schoolwork and other responsibilities. \n\nWIBTA if I told said no to helping on the tests and having her do it on her own?"

She originally had planned to postpone the ceremony to this year in august, but is now heavily pregnant with her first child so she cancelled it altogether.\nBecause of this there is a stunning 4k wedding dress hanging in my parents basement that has never been worn.\n\nSo anyway some weeks ago I showed my mom some dresses I liked and she ended up asking me why I wouldn't ask my sister to wear her wedding dress, since it hasn't been worn.\nWell while my sister wouldn't have a problem with that as far as I know her, there is a problem:\n\nWhile my sister is the exact same height as me, she was doing cardio every single day and weighed 125Ibs when she got married. I am 165Ibs.\nI am already exercising and dieting, but loosing 40Ibs is not my goal at all. \n\nSo I told my mom that, despite loving my sister's dress, I wouldn't wear it because I wasn't planning to get that skinny and because it would probably be way to cold since it's a summer dress and my wedding is set for january.\nMy mom basically snapped at me, saying that she can't believe I rather let that dress rott in the basement than just loose a little more weight and buy a jacket and that I shouldn't even dare to ask her to buy yet another dress.\nI didn't really respond to that yet (conversation was over chat) and quickly changed the subject.\nWhile I am kinda floored that my mom will not pay for my dress as well (my dad is quiet about the subject), since I assumed it would be kinda fair if they did for all of their daughters, I continued looking for dresses to buy one for myself.\n\nSo yesterday I told my mom I would buy my own dress and asked her to make some time to look at dresses and she blew up again, saying that she couldn't believe that I wouldn't just make sisters dress work and basically calling me an inconsiderate, lazy brat.\n\nMy sister and my fianc\u00e9 are on my side and say that my mother is being ridiculous because it isn't my fault that the dress had never been worn and admitting it would be really hard to make it work (my fianc\u00e9 also said he would also prefer me not to get that skinny).

            "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: I (23M) lived together with a close friend L (23M) for 5 years in a shared apartment in city A. A year ago, I moved out to city B 200 miles away. W (M27), a friend from university of L and an acquaintance of mine moved into the flat and took over my lease and room. The apartment is spacious, including 3 rooms. Both of them have their own and there is a shared living room in addition to the bathroom and kitchen.\n\nNow, a year later, I have accepted a 12-weeks internship in city A again. The original plan was to work 80% remotely from my own apartment in city B. Unfortunately, my companies plans changed and I now have to be there for atlest 4 days a week atleast for the start. \n\nW is a consultant and works 100% remotely, e.g. from the apartment. L however basically spends all his time at his girlfriends place, not visiting the apartment with W for weeks at a time , however still paying his half of rent. Since my company is literally a 20-minute walk from the apartment, it would make sence for me to stay there if this is fine for them, especially since L's room is empty most of the time.\n\nI asked L, who happily told me to be his guest whenever I want, stay in his room and sleep in his bed. He even gave me his spare key. He told me to work everything else out with W but he is completely fine with me staying there from Monday-Thursday.\n\nNow, I stayed in the apartment for the first week (while being at work and gym for most of the day) and W made it pretty clear that he is not comfortable with this. He basically told me that he is used to living on his own there. He recently went through a bad breakup (which I 100% understand) and therefore likes to be alone and in peace and quiet. I am a very easy roommate, clean my dishes instantly and do not hang out in the common room. All I do is come home from work, cook something, hit the gym and sleep.\n\nHe agreed to this and stated that it's not about things like this at all or me as a person, but rather about him being alone. He works from his room from 8 to 5 and usually hangs out there after as well. He also told me that I accepted an internship in a different city and it is therefore my responsibility to find a place. I told him that I did, L's room, who is fine with this, and also mentioned that he does live in a shared apartment. While its great that he only pays half rent while having the whole place to himself, it's still L's place too and he does not do me any favor, L does (which is the part where I might be the asshole). I also mentioned that he could not forbid L to come to his very own place either. L does not want to get involved at all, which he told me from the beginning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we didn't really finish the topic. My only alternative is to stay at my parents house, which is a 1,5hour drive resulting in 20$ everyday, and therefore not really an option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo: WIBTA if I still stayed at my friend's (L) apartment regularly?"

I was excited to try them since he is super good at making the tuna burgers but when I first tasted the veggie burgers I told him that that they were too dry and that they tasted kinda bad. When I told him his excitement from his face disappeared. After I finished eating I ask my mom if she liked the burgers and she loved them. I never really tell him if his cooking taste bad because he always makes the best meals but this time I wanted to tell him how I felt about the taste. So am I the asshole?"

Today though she had called her boyfriend at 11:00 at night and I was having trouble sleeping already, since I took my adhd medication late. And I tried to ignore it but it got to be too loud so I asked her to please quiet down and she said \u201cyou\u2019re one to talk\u201d because I had talked to my friend the day before and was loud since I haven\u2019t hung out or talked to anyone in weeks and so I was excited, but I was still being loud which wasn\u2019t okay. But it was 12:00 pm, not 11:00 pm. So I didn\u2019t think what I did was as bad. I shouldn\u2019t have been loud and I understand that but I don\u2019t think it equates to doing it close to midnight. Anyways she stayed the same volume, so I told my mom to ask her to go downstairs so I could sleep since our rooms are next to each other. She got mad and told her what a hypocrite I am and I shouldn\u2019t get mad when I do the same thing. Once my mom left she complained to her boyfriend about how I\u2019m annoying and part of the reason she wants to move out soon. It hurt my feelings so I went to go pet my dogs to stop me from crying but my mom asked me what was wrong and that for some reason makes me cry when I\u2019m asked that. I told her what she said and she said she was going to yell at her and i asked her not to but I think she will in the morning. ATIA?"

I usually try to be respectful whenever I express my negative feelings towards her but I always get frustrated with her because she acts dense when I try to.\n\nEver since I was a kid and she needed me to get something or give me something she\u2019d always throw it at me. If she needed me to take something to the kitchen she would throw it. If she wanted me to put something away she would throw it. What makes it worse is that I would be standing right next to her and instead of handing the bottle to me she chose to drop it on the floor. It makes me upset because I literally feel like a dog as if we were playing fetch. Since I don\u2019t like that feeling I expressed it to her and she just brushed it off. She did it several times after so I threw something back at her when she needed it and she was livid so I thought that would help her understand how I feel. She still does it and its driving me mad. Whenever I express my feelings to her she keeps saying \u201ci\u2019m the adult and your the child\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean you can disrespect me when you feel like.

Because of this we havent had much time to discuss the logistics. In the end I agree happily to droping him &amp; his friends in the city 60mins away (sidenote -the weather today is the worst - think highways flooding, trains cancelled due to the harbour crashing onto train tracks).\n\nDue to the weather his mate &amp; him decided to take a train replacement bus so I dropt him to the bus stop.\n\nDuring this 20min trip, I mention to him to just remember  when you get to \"that\" point in the night, when youve drank too much that you dont need to keep drinking &amp; can cool it.\n\nBefore I could finish speaking he went off... yelling at me that he doesnt wanna hear it, that I should shut up. To which I said can you let me finish ? He continued to shut me down repeating he doesnt wanna hear it claiming im trying to make it about me.  \n\nI replied calmly I wanted to finish what I wanted to say because youve taken this the wrong way. I managed to state that I want him to have a good night &amp; happy that he is finally catching up with his mates, but regardless i dont want you to feel super ickk in the morning due to over doing it / mixing spirits..but mainly that I had also arranged a play date so the kids would be out of the house in the morning so youd have some time to recover.\n\nHe kept interjecting when i was trying to state the above.. Not only was he repeating shut the fuck up in a raised voice he undone his seat belt &amp; demanded i stop the car &amp; that he would find his own way and be late .... i said dont be stupid we *kids are in the car tooo* will drop you off.   I asked if i could just clear up  what i was trying to say and to please stop yelling.  \n\nHe didnt really let me have a clear shot at explaining myself, kept butting in with remarks \"shut the fuck up, im a grown man\", you keep repeating yourself\" and at 3 points whacked the door and dashboard.\n\nThat level of aggression was uncalled for, but in the end I said I feel shit for having this turn into a problem because thats not what I wanted, i apologised for mentioning a cut off point &amp; reiterated I want him to have a rad night by all accounts.\n\nIm now at home feeling shit.

She and her boyfriend used to live together in this house, but broke up around 6 months ago (which was about 4 months before I moved in), so I hadn't met him, although I had heard his name before.\n\nI should also mention that I have a mild case of prosopagnosia, or face-blindness. This isn't an issue most of the time, but it's not uncommon for me to get people mixed up at work for several months. I have also run into several (longish-term) exes a few months after breaking up and taken several minutes to recognise them. This is a little irritating to live with, but overall most people just think it's funny and it's never caused problems before beyond momentary embarrassment on my part.\n\nA few weeks ago, my roommate had a guy over and I happened to walk into the kitchen while they were baking together. We made small talk for a minute or so while I grabbed some food and then left, but I know that they had been dating because she and I had talked about him prior.\n\nThe other day, I got home and my roommate was in the kitchen again with a guy. I thought it was the same guy she was seeing from a few weeks ago, so when she introduced me to him, I said, \"I think we met a few weeks ago?\" He replied, \"no, I don't think so, I used to live here,\" to which I responded, \"oh, sorry, I'm not very good with faces.\" I then realised that he was her ex-boyfriend who used to live here with her. They resumed chatting with each other while I quickly put my groceries away and went to my room.\n\nThe next morning, I was making breakfast in the kitchen when my roommate came downstairs. I began saying that I was sorry about the evening before and hoped I hadn't caused any problems, but before I could even get a few words out, she began screaming at me that I'd humiliated her. I tried to explain that I have a medical issue that makes it difficult for me to remember faces, but she continued screaming and swearing at me, while saying that they looked completely different (apparently there were significant differences in height/hair colour/accent between the two men) and that I had a \"fucking problem\". She stormed off shortly after, leaving me quite rattled on a day when I had a big presentation coming up at work.\n\nEver since then, I've felt very stressed at home to the point where I've been obsessing a bit over the issue and have lost my appetite. My friends and workmates all think she was being irrational and crossed the line by yelling at me like that. I feel bad for upsetting her, but I do think that she overreacted to what was a genuine mistake. AITA?"

Now I can't speak for 4 year old or younger me. But I know by the time I started kindy I had no interest in having a sibling and never ever asked for a sister lol. I had friends who hated their siblings and that made me think I was lucky to be an only. My parents pushed it so hard and would tell me I should spend more time with my sister and take better care of her since I had wanted her so badly. My sister bought the whole thing and if I pushed back on the lie my parents would threaten to ground me. When I was 15 and she was 8 I told her that our parents were lying and I hadn't asked for a sister every day my parents grounded me for a week. They told me I had broken my sisters heart and it was a mean spirited thing to say. I told them it was their lie and not mine and they said it brought my sister joy and that should be all that matters. My sister took that lie as meaning we should spend all our time together and she hated when I didn't want to. It was especially shitty because she was clingy as fuck and she would meltdown when I didn't want to take her places. She practically wanted to move in with me when I left my parents house.\n\nSo a couple of weeks ago my sister was asking to move in with me and I told her no. She said come on, I had wanted her so badly and I should want to be around her more than I seem to. That it seemed shitty to want her so badly and then discard her like she's not my sister. I told her to cool it with the exaggeration and plenty of siblings live apart and don't spend every waking moment together. She told me most siblings don't ask specifically for a specific sibling like I did. And I told her I never asked. That mom and dad made that up when she was a baby and refused to let me say the truth and when I did, when she was 8, they claimed I was lying and punished me for it. She told me it was a lie and that she didn't get why I was such a dirty liar. I told her to listen to me clearly, I never asked for a sibling, I never begged them for a sister and I didn't wish her into existence and that I hated the lie.\n\nShe was crushed and ran to our parents who again acted like I was a monster. She's lapping up the lies from them and told me she hopes I come to accept the truth some day.\n\nAITA?"

When I see her in the kitchen she immediately says \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come when I called you the first time?\u201d \nI said that I\u2019m sorry, I was [doing chore] and what\u2019s up?\nShe then mutters and I quote: \u201cI\u2019m already stressed with Papa (my stepdad) and now you want to add to my stress.\u201d\n\nNote, my stepdad has recently been through a bout of depression and drinking, we had the police involved but he\u2019s okay now and we were over it for the most part.\n\nNormally I would\u2019ve ignored the comment because she does this a lot, but this time I\u2019d had enough.\n\nThe conversation more or less went like this:\n\nMe: Why are you guilt tripping me for that?\nHer: I\u2019m not guilt tripping you.\nM: No you are. How is it my problem what happened to Papa and how is it relevant now? How does me not coming when you call add to your stress?\nH: I\u2019m not guilt tripping you, why didn\u2019t you come when I called you?\nM: I said I was sorry, what was the need of brining Papa up? I get that you\u2019re stressed but it\u2019s not just you. (I\u2019m doing my GCSE\u2019s soon).\n\nI continued to say: I understand that your stressed but you can\u2019t just dump that onto me. I\u2019m stressed too, you\u2019re not the only one in this family that can be stressed you know. \n\nLet me clarify that the reason I said this is because she\u2019s constantly saying stuff like \u201cYou guys think I don\u2019t get tired, I go to work all day and nobody can think about me. \u201cSometimes I feel like I\u2019m taken for granted etc.\u201d\n\nI asked why she called me and she said \u201cWhy haven\u2019t the boys (my little brother and his friend) showered yet?\u201d\n\nM: You didn\u2019t tell me I had to shower them.\n\nH: Am I meant to tell you? Why can\u2019t you think? Do you even think whether they have showered yet?\n\nM: If you told me or texted me to make sure they showered I would have. You can\u2019t expect me to read your mind, I don\u2019t know when they are meant to shower and they should know when to themselves anyway. \n\nH: You are the oldest, you are meant to know.\n\nM: I may be the oldest but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m responsible for them. I am a child. If you want me to make sure they shower, you tell me. Papa is in the house, why isn\u2019t he being told the kids need to shower?\n \nI know it\u2019s because I\u2019m a girl. There\u2019s many other things in the house that others are capable of doing but my mum always comes to me first because I\u2019m the oldest girl. \n\nThe argument just carried on with more guilt tripping and self centered stuff that ended with me crying in my room. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n**TL; DR My mum keeps guilt tripping me with her problems and when it broke out into an argument I confronted her which led to more arguing.**"

Rather we should just ban her boyfriend from her house and make it clear that her behavior is not appreciated. Maybe I am jumping the gun here? \n\nI know that this will hurt my daughter. She will have to get a job and it will probably stress her out. Maybe I am trying to punish her for this? However I feel that she is not entitled to this money and grades and good behavior were condition I have fixed. I can't take it that my daughter will if not condone, she will tolerate someone who hurts her brother like that at the same time the way I am punishing her could hurt her too.

Last Christmas my brother got me a gaming chair, at the time i had a stool he had given me but it was somewhat uncomfortable using for long periods of times. Enough back story, so a few months ago my mom's boyfriend came by and my mom was going to shave his head. At the time i was in the living room playing Video games well my mom comes to me and asks me if i can let her borrow the chair so she can shave his head. Now many people know what a gaming chair looks like, and i think all of them are similar, but for those that don't know the back is high and well my mom is a short person so i knew it would get in her way therefore i suggested her to use the stool instead so i paused my game and got her the stool but she said she would prefer the chair instead and i once again told her no and the reason why. She stormed off so i just left the stool next to me incase she needed it. Now where the real issue i have with this is that my mom came back into the living room and said that I'm a greedy person and that i should learn manners and when I'm asked something i should give them that thing without hesitation. I was about to tell her that i didn't mean it that way, but before i got a chance she had already left. She came back a few more times the first one was to grab a dining room chair and to tell me that i have no manners and the next time was to take the stool and to tell me that i am an ungreatful and disrespectful child and that i should be more like my brother. By this point i had enough because i just wanted to play a game and i couldn't without her coming in to tell me stuff and leave before i got a chance to even respond. I was heading back into my room so i grabbed the stupid chair and dragged it into her room where she was crying and her boyfriend just looked at me and said the obvious \"after all the things your mother does for you and this is how you repay her.\" He said more things but at that point i couldn't say anything because i felt so guilty and just, i don't even know. This story happened a while ago, i think in the start of this year so issue has been resolved, My brother got mad and called me telling me since I'm the youngest one of the house i have no room to talk back and i should do what I'm told to do. But it still has been bothering me, i just want to know, was i the asshole for talking back to my mother. (Also sorry if this story is idk how to say, different? I'm new to this whole reddit stuff, seen post here and there, watched those YouTubers who read reddit posts and all but still new to this)"

My dad is a lot more chill.\n\nNow, my mom has this rule that, on top of not being allowed to go essentially anywhere, I have to be home before dark. This is fine in the summer, but it sucks in the winter when the sun sets before 5 and I need to catch a 40 minute bus ride home. I'm an art student and I need access to the studio spaces sometimes to finish my work.\n\nI managed to do the last year remote because of covid and it was hell. Next semester I'm going back to in person classes. I'm thinking I will no longer respect this rule and just get home whenever I've finished what I needed to do for the day. The studio is open til 9, I probably wouldn't stay til after 7 anyway unless something very important was due. I already nearly failed a pottery class once because she wouldn't let me go to the studio for 3 weeks to do my work since \"i should be able to get everything done in class\" (I showed her the class syllabus which stated there would be ~5 hours of \"hw\" per week) and I was clearly lying to hang out with friends, instead (I have never done this).\n\nI know technically my mom cant stop me since I'm an adult, but I know from experience she can and will make my home life hell, and if I don't respond she will take it out on my dad, as well. I can only handle so much until I usually break. I cannot leave this situation, but I hate to put my dad in the position of dealing with the fallout from my decision. Wibta if I went through with it anyway? I've proven I can find a way to do these assignments at home, but its been so miserable I need the space and the freedom of working in a real studio or I think I might break."

Then she mentions she cancelled her brunch, and blames it on her selfish family that chose to ignore her BD and chose another event to attend instead.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to this day, X also let me know she wasn't about to spend her BD with a bunch of old people she doesn't know at a restaurant that doesn't cater to her vegan diet.\n\nThe people she referred to are either relatives or lifelong friends of our family that she has known all her life and met multiple times over the course of the years. As far as vegan food, my parents always go out of their way to make sure the restaurant accommodates her specific diet.\n\nI felt that she was being very selfish and also unfair towards my parents, so I sent her a carefully worded message explaining the situation and asking her to look at it from a different point of view, and also mentioning that she was being unreasonable and hurtful towards her grandparents.\n\nShe replied by saying she had already discussed the situation with her grandparents and everything was resolved between them, but the rest of the family was disrespecting her by ignoring her BD and telling her to keep her mouth shut about it. And she said she was done with this whole thing.\n\nI once again explained that we all did acknowledge her BD and congratulated her, and we also offered other options as a compromise, trying to word my msg as nicely as possible, but I basically told her in so many words that she was acting selfish and entitled.\n\nDid she really expect me to skip my own Mom's BD for hers?\n\nSo, AITA for speaking up about her \"tantrum\"?"

Later in the evening they reassured me they weren't upset with me, they had just been dealing with a depressive episode and needed some space. During the apology they made what I thought was a quip: \"Sorry for keeping you at arm's- no football field length since you're American.\" I thought it was funny and I laughed and he said \"Are you going to tell our friends I said that?\" and I said I hadn't been planning on it. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I told my mom the football field quip and she thought it was funny.

Their dad met Maggie two years later and the bond between her and my husbands sister was instant, while he never saw her as more than his dad's wife. It created some conflict between him and his sister because she was very pushy on the whole thing according to him, and I have witnessed some of it myself, saying that she deserves to be accepted as another mom to them both and not just her and she told him that she's been more of a mom to them than their mom was. It started a huge fight for them and they didn't talk for a few years because of it. \n\nLast year my husbands sister had a baby girl and honored Maggie with the name. Saying she wanted her daughter to be named after her mom. A few months later we found out I was pregnant and we decided to go with an honor toward his mom. What then started was a huge clusterfuck of hurt and anger. My husbands sister asked why he disrespected Maggie, and why he wouldn't give her any kind of nod in the name, my husband told her that Maggie isn't his mom, isn't someone he is close to and therefor does not get a name. Maggie told him it was his choice. She would have been his mom in a heartbeat. He told her that was the problem, that she based the relationship off of being their mom instead of being part of the family and when it was clear he didn't want another mom like relationship with her she acted like that was the only option.\n\nMaggie and my husbands sister have been trying to involve me. To make me tell him that she's grandma so it makes sense to get an honor name. To convince my husband that she should be a full grandma and not anything half assed. I told them no. My husband told them to leave me out of it. His sister said to me that it's going to hurt the relationship our daughter has with Maggie if he's making such a deal out of honoring her and the hard work she has put in with them and the great job she did raising them.\n\nWhen I didn't get involved they told me I was an asshole and this is my family now too and so I should be willing to help with family problems. My husband told them maybe he doesn't need them in his life anymore. And that he's tired of them.\n\nAITA?"

It did not end well. \n\nMy parents accused me of trying to abandon them to pursue a life of my own. I told them that, yes, that was what was happening, although \u201cabandon\u201d isn\u2019t the right word. My parents began to scream at me, citing how \u201cwe fed you, clothed you, and bathed you your whole life\u201d.\n\nI told them that they have done none of those things for many years. I have bought my own groceries and clothes for the past two years, and they haven\u2019t actually bathed me for over a decade and a half. They then told me how ungrateful I was being.\n\nAfter an intense shouting match, my mom told me to leave, so I left. I told them that I was going to a friends house, which friend, and that I was staying the night. I packed up my bag with exclusively things I bought (so they couldn\u2019t say I stole anything) and drove off.\n\n40 minutes later, armed cops rolled up to my friends house, asking where I was.\n\nIt took 2 hours of questioning from police for them to finally tell us that my mom called saying I had been kidnapped. They let us go, but the cops said that I should\u2019ve stayed home and listened to my mother (ironic, right?).\n\nI was escorted home by the police and was told not to leave my house or I\u2019d be arrested.\n\nMy family, as usual told me how much of I dick I was being, but so did the cops. There were, like, 5 cops who told me how selfish I was being for leaving home like that.\n\nSo here I am, sitting in my room, wondering if I was in the wrong. I know what my mom did was wrong, but I\u2019m still a minor. I can\u2019t just up and leave like that. Am I the asshole?"

My mom pressured me to go since I don\u2019t spend time with them that much.The only reason I agreed to go was because I thought my aunt and my cousins would be there (the only people I like on my dads side to be honest).My mother told them that they would be paying for everything but I wasn\u2019t supposed to match with them.\nEx1: My dad, his girlfriend and their kids and me wore red\nEx2: My other aunt, her husband and their kids wore green\nAnd so on for the others. I was the only kid that wore pants (they made me) and it was very hot there. When we got there I distanced myself from everyone else because I didn\u2019t want to be there. My father came over to me and asked why I was alone. I played it off saying that I was hot and being in the heat aggravates me, he left me alone for a little while but when it was time to take pictures they had us bunched up which made me even more mad. Once they was done taking photos with the kids in it I decided I was gonna go to the playground and chill but was stopped when my uncle said that it wasn\u2019t fair to the younger kids (I was the oldest kid there) I told him I\u2019m old enough to watch myself and that they could still see me from where I was going he told me to sit down and wait. I sat down on a bench close to them and waited. Once they finished taking pictures by the playground they wanted to move by a lake and lake and take pictures there. I stayed behind on our walk there and texted my mom about how I wanted to go home and that I was uncomfortable here. My dad came back to talk to me asking me the same questions as earlier and i told him the same thing. My mom told me to call her and she would come pick me up (the park was very close to my house) she did just that and my other family members was calling me selfish since I wanted to leave on my grandmother\u2019s birthday. Another reason I didn\u2019t want to be there was because sometime in 2019 she told me I wasn\u2019t her real granddaughter and some problems I have with my father.\n\n\nI don\u2019t really get along with my father because he not the best tbh\n\nEx1: on my birthday (21st of may) he told me he would come pick me up so we can bond since I haven\u2019t seen him since we had to stay home due to covid. In November of 2020 I was in the hospital and my mother told him I was there but he just left her on seen (didn\u2019t care to visit or call)\n\nEx2: My father has 7 kids (including me, I\u2019m his only child by my mom) Him and his girlfriend make ALOT of money (only because they have a lot of kid together) and not even a little bit of that gets spent on me.\n\nIm not an expensive kid and I don\u2019t ask for much. I just wish he\u2019d pay more attention to me.  (Btw my aunt and cousins didn\u2019t show up)\n\n-I haven\u2019t told anyone this but when I was about 10-11 my dad would kiss me on the lips.

I let at least one parent know I was going for a run at school, and that was that. I go for the run at like 7pm, and then we hang out at his apartment for a bit. I get back to my car at like 11:30, and I check my phone. Tons of calls and texts from my sister, my parents, and my extended family. My sister had rallied everyone into trying to contact me. I listen to her voicemail saying she called campus security and they\u2019re looking for me. I\u2019m like wtf, but I call everyone and sort things out and let them know I\u2019m on the way home. I apologize and say I\u2019ll check my phone more.\n\nIt\u2019s happened a couple of times since then. Recently, I went to the movies with friends at night, and when we got out of the movie, we realized that she\u2019d been calling and texting me and a few of my friends asking where I was repeatedly. Not only that, but friends of mine had been calling me and other friends because they thought I was missing. I sort things out again.\n\nTonight, I was on a date. This was my 3rd date with this guy, and we kinda had plans for me to stay over, I told my dad I was going out and might not see him until the morning. He\u2019s like ok. A couple hours into the date, I check my phone, and there\u2019s 12 missed calls, and more texts. My sister was at it again. I had a voicemail from my mom (out of town) telling me to call her sometime tonight, and I had a few much more panicky voicemails from my sister asking where I am. Apparently she called my friends and extended family again. I guess my dad left the house and didn\u2019t pick up her calls either."

A few hours later, my mother wakes up, and sees us watching Netflix, and starts her morning by throwing insults at video games and saying that 'they're not age appropriate' and 'we're too old for them'.  \nWe ignore that and keep watching.\n\nLater on my brother and I start an argument (daily routine) and my mother starts saying it's 'because we play too much video games' and 'we shouldn't be watching videos before bed'. Keep in mind that me and my brothers only get two hours of screen time per day only on weekends and holidays. And only in the summer vacation, they *sometimes* let us have an extra hour or watch videos.  \nSo she starts complaining about how she should give us less screen time and remove our extra time. \n\nI get there are some family rules, but she is just pushing those limits too far.\n\nA little extra backstory (optional) back in school days, I was able to convince her to let us have an hour outside of weekends too, and we were close to ending a semester, so she had stated that our grades that semester would not affect her giving us an extra hour on school days. Grades come out, I get a 16.87/20 (my average scores in online school were around 16.5, so that was pretty good) but she considered it bad since before online school I used to get straight 18/20s and guess what she did?

            "text": "During the summer I\u2019ve been working at a wildlife rehabilitation center as an unpaid intern. When I first started this internship, I realized that the facility was NOTHING like it was described during training. We literally work out of garages of rented homes with no air conditioning. The center is also chronically short-staffed, as there are 2-3 interns per shift, and only 2 paid employees present on any given day. If one unpaid intern calls in sick, everybody else falls behind for the day.\n\nShort-staffing is only the tip of the iceberg. The working conditions are deplorable, as well as the animals\u2019 living conditions. I worked 24 to 32 hours a week (8-hour shifts; manual labor) with no scheduled breaks or any designated break room. We were also misled on how the center operated during training\u2014we were told specifically that any animals with dirty kennels needed to be relocated into clean kennels. Well, turns out there aren\u2019t enough staff/enough time to clean unused kennels, so we ended up having to clean around the animals, which wasn\u2019t sufficient because many of the cages became infested with maggots. I also expected the animals to be placed in appropriate-sized cages, but instead they are all placed in ridiculously small plastic kennels.\n\nIt is also very seldom that us interns in the afternoon shift (2-10pm) get out on time. One time I had to stay past 11:30pm. Yesterday, I had asked one of the owners if I could go home at 10:05pm, and she essentially said \u201cyes, but no,\u201d and proceeded to guilt trip/coerce me into staying an hour or more later because whatever work interns don\u2019t do, the owners/paid employees have to do, which often causes the paid employees to stay until 1am. I ended up leaving early anyway, because we ran out of the correct tubes to tube-feed baby bunnies with, and I got frustrated trying to use the flimsy makeshift tubes we made out of urinary catheters.\n\nThis morning I received a text from one of the owners who told me leaving early was inappropriate, and that I needed additional training on tube-feeding bunnies (which I am already proficient at\u2014it\u2019s not my fault we had to use inappropriate equipment that made tube-feeding impossible). So, I said enough was enough and told her I quit. She said she wants to discuss things with me over the phone tomorrow before I make \u201csuch a radical decision\u201d because my absence could adversely affect the schedule at the center and cause everybody to fall behind."

Got married, and after having three kids she wasn't able to continue working. Got divorced and was left a single mother. Father was abusive and left us with a lot of trauma, and minimum financial help. She raised me and my siblings, taking the best jobs she could get.

I already did all the steps necessary to enroll in classes, just need her blessing because I still live with her. She wants me to get a career and be able to move out, but she seems to want it to be any career but this. WIBTA if I scheduled my classes?"

I don't really want her to be a mom figure but I also don't think she's a bad person (kinda annoying religious but I guess that's not the worst thing). Her kids are just her kids to me. My half brother is so young I have love for him but it's not like he's my whole world or anything, which is what people told me would happen when my dad's wife was pregnant.\n\nSo you can see it's kinda messy. My dad and his wife sat me and her kids down a few days ago to talk about stuff and see where everyone was at.

I said I wasn't sure what I wanted from my relationship with her and overall I still wasn't totally happy that we were a blended family now. I was still coming to terms with the fact my family isn't my ideal family with my dad, my mom and me, and how I wouldn't have chosen any of this so it was me basically figuring out what level of involvement would make me happiest and most comfortable given that.\n\nHer kids got upset. Like really upset. The oldest asked why I didn't want to be a real family with them and they ran off. My dad looked uneasy and his wife was pissed I made her kids cry. My dad told me that he had hoped I would be over that by now, that therapy had helped and family therapy before they got married had ironed all that stuff out. I told him that while I didn't want to be dismissive, this was all his choice and he was ready, but I wasn't, and he got to choose his new family, I didn't. He told me kids don't usually get to choose their family and I said I know and that's why I was trying to figure stuff out and going out of my way not to be a jerk. His wife is still very pissed at me and said she didn't deserve me \"needing to figure stuff out\" that I should want to build up something close with her. And I shouldn't be saying the kind of crap I did in front of younger kids. I also shouldn't be expressing that I don't want a family her kids had just said they want to be closer.\n\nAITA?"

Most of the hotels on that sea resort were already reserved so we decided to let Mark find a hotel for us and the hotel which he reserved looked kinda bad on the outside on photos in Google but somehow the reviews were good. I don't blame him it is not his fault he couldn't have known. I was like \"ahh it really cant be that bad\" and didn't want to be a whiney bum and decided to go this extremely cheap hotel. However I didn't expect it to be this bad. It literally has no A/C (site said it did), the room is on the roof (like the roof in the room is bent) it is literally very moist regardless if it is day or night and there is no breakfast. \n\nI could barely sleep, I slept for 4 hours I woke up multiple times due to the heat (26\u00b0C, 79\u00b0F). Also I have extreme problem with heat I feel like I will suffocate and sometimes it initiates a panic attack. I found another near this one which is 3 star, has AC and has very good reviews. I asked my friends if they want to switch hotel with me and they refused so and kept saying I was spoiled and I complain all the time and other stuff. I decided I will still pay for the room we initially chose but sleep at the other hotel because I feel like this heat is killing me. I feel I can sacrifice a few bucks to save myself from meltdown.\n\nIn the end of the day we will all be together throughout the day, we just sleep at different places.\n\nSo what do you guys think?"

Not that close but we connect on a certain level.\nMy cousin had a male friend that was to close to her al  the family knew about and she used to call brother, after a while she started acting weird if you even mention him so i figured they started dating and so did her own brother who told me.\nAfter a while i started dating a girl who is one of my cousin's best friends and while we talked she assured me that my cousin was dating that guy and told me all the toxic stuff he says to her (like don't talk to ur male cousins, i don't want you to work...) And that when she works she buys him stuff, and she sell her phone to give him money. And by the time a difference started showing up on my cousin as she didn't want to work anymore and a lot of stuff on her behavior, me and my mom talked about and i ended up telling my mom what the girl i was dating by the time told  somehow my mom told my sister and my sister told my cousin trying to warn her and give her advice. Thankfully my sister didn't tell the story correctly and a lot of stuff were wrong. My cousin asked me and i said that my mom heard me talkin to a friend of mine about some other girl and she thought i was talking with her friend about her, and i also managed to make my Friend make an audio talking about someone describing what my sister told her, i also told my girlfriend that my mom must of heard me while talking with her on the phone.\nIt's been months and me and my cousin are on good terms, but she's still not talking to my mom. I feel bad for my mom cuz she took the hit but i also think she diserves it because she told my sister, nut i also think that im such a jerk for telling her."

There's also the issue of privacy, that I don't think I've had since I was six years old (the last time I had my own room, since my parents have 4 kids together including me and we were never rich or anything). \n\nA few months ago, we moved into our new house. My brother and I were to share a room, again. But about 2 days later my brother decided to move to our old apartment and try living on his own. So I had the room to myself for about 3 months which honestly felt amazing. I could play music out loud for the first time, I could do anything because I was in charge. But then my brother began having financial problems and had to move back in. Of course I was pissed and disappointed but I never said anything. I did secretly hope he'd move to the couch but without saying anything he took his desk, brought some things and just like that my room went from being 60 percent empty to 10 percent empty. \nHe also snores. \n\n(Btw living in the house currently is my brother, me, my younger brother who's 2 years old, my mom and her boyfriend)\n\nI was willing to put up with it, but I read a post on here and the comments said that the parents should move to the living room so that the kids have privacy. I don't know if that applies to this situation, so WIBTA if I said I wanted my room back to myself?"

My parents think I'm being reasonable since they're tired of doing the same thing, so does my other sister Katie, because even when she tried to do just the pasta before it wasn't good enough. \n\nI guess I kinda feel bad that she only eats fries at my house but I feel like it's unfair to ask me to cook two different meals.

I've lived in a predominantly Muslim country for the first 21 years of my life which is when I moved to Japan for 3 years for my brothers job.\n\nI moved to the USA at 24 to pursue a degree in psychology. I live here alone and I don't know if this is important but my brother's job is high paying so I have a nice sized apartment and a swanky car.\n\nNow I'm a dedicated Muslim I follow the rules, I pray and I recite as well. I'm very happy with my faith, which is smth that at first bothered some of the people at my uni because they had this weird almost bigoted idea of Islam. They tried to get me to drink, smoke and dress more revealing which I told them to quit almost immediately and they sincerely apologized and have legitimately changed their view on what Islam is. \n\nAll except one who I'll call \"Jessica\". Now Jessica is hell bent on \"liberating\" me by still wanting to make do the stuff I mentioned before which is extremely hypocritical of her. Because she's basically forcing me to more free by shaming me.\n\nShe says bigoted and Islamophobic things all the time. And recently there was a new student in our class who I thought was sorta attractive, and I made the huge mistake of mentioning it to the group because Jessica was constantly trying to set me up with him. While I think he's good looking I'm not interested in any type of relationship with anyone.\n\n4 days ago I went to our usual diner where we meet up and I found the guy Jess was saying I should date, I thought someone from the group invited him but he said that Jess told me to come here under the pretenses of a date with me. I immediately shot him down but he wanted me to hang out with him a little longer, I refused because I didn't feel comfortable with him anymore.\n\nHe literally said, \"hey it's ok Jess said u might be nervous because you're and would be skittish with me\" I swear I saw red I'm pretty sure I blacked out from anger and don't even remember the trip to Jess's apartment.\n\nThere I basically ripped into her and I called her a bitch for forcing me to give up my values and take her liberated ideas, that what she did to me was worse than whatever misogyny she thinks I go through as a Muslim woman. Well, it turns out our friends were there and heard everything I said to her. \n\nWhile most are on my side, the ones who've known jess longer said that I should've handled it more maturely and shouldn't have blown up in a way that a lot of people building heard everything and have been giving her dirty looks. \n\nSince then I've been having doubts about the way handled everything because I could've talked to her in private and not given a bad rep about her to her neighbors."

T convinced me to ask her out with the intention of dumping her. The whole  point was she\u2019d be heartbroken then he\u2019d be there for her. Very dumb, heartless, and not my proudest moment believe me. We were both 2 stupid 19 yr olds. A couple months later I felt guilty and told her the whole truth. She stopped being friends with us both. Months later I missed her and reached out because surprise, got feelings for her. Took her time to forgive me but we tried a relationship for real. Been together ever since. T of course heard about this and we haven\u2019t been friends in a long time . \n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years. Still have a few same friends from back then but haven\u2019t seen T around. One of our close friends got married last weekend. Went with my wife and our son who\u2019s 6. We knew T\u2019d  be there too but didn\u2019t think anything of it, especially with it being so long already. During the reception is when it got weird. Wouldn\u2019t stop staring at our table. We said hi before that but didn\u2019t make conversation. He came over again sometime later after he\u2019d been practically staring for an hour and already drunk. Made some comments about how crazy life worked out after \u201cstealing his girl\u201d (like if this is some hs drama), being creepy the way he looked at my wife, when my son came back to the table T tried to introduce himself to him  as one of our old friends from  school then made a \u201cjoke\u201d that he almost could\u2019ve been his dad. We stopped him there, my wife took my son to the dance floor and I told T to leave us alone for the rest of the night. He claimed he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong so my wife and I decided to go. We informed the groom - my friend - we were leaving and he asked us why so I told him. \n\nInstead he had his brothers ask T to talk outside, to avoid a scene, then told him to leave. Security didn\u2019t let him back into the hall. My friend apologized to us he didn\u2019t think T would behave like that even if he was drunk. Some of our friends heard what happened at the party and think I was an asshole for completely overreacted having T kicked out. Simply because he also had a right to be there celebrating our friend\u2019s wedding and to cut him some slack because he was drunk, obviously seeing us together brought back old feelings so we can\u2019t blame him. I get we have history, thought it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal after all these years, and he made us uncomfortable with his comments. Especially around my son. Wasn\u2019t expecting something like this to happen so I\u2019m not sure if maybe I did overreact instead of ignoring T and let him be part of the celebration too. AITA?"

I have no friends to invite over, but I (21F) am sick and tired of dealing with and cleaning up after them in this tiny home, especially with my chronic health conditions. AITA?\n\n First things first, I am 21F and my partner is 28M and we have been together / living together for 2.5 years now. We both work full time, VERY laborous blue collar jobs. This is the only way I can afford my routine surgeries, check ups, exams, and overall dwindling physical health. I have 2 chronic health conditions that leave me unable to move most days after work.\n\n Anyways, I love my bf dearly but since we began living together I feel he tosses my health aside and prioritizes his friends and their comfort 1st. They always come over to our house, they always gotta eat over here, they can't go to a bar and drink, they gotta drink in my living room for some reason. To clear any misconceptions up, NO- I do not hold him back from his friends or ask him to cancel. I always say things like: \"Well, could you maybe go hang with him at his place? Could you guys maybe go out somewhere? I'm trying to rest and I hurt really bad. Can you go to the bar together or something?\" But he always tells me: \"Look, I get you dont have any friends and you feel sick all the time but that doesnt mean my life has to revolve around yours and your feelings. I should be allowed to have my friends over without your opinion. I pay bills here too.\" \n\n Thing is, \"bills\" ain't enough to me. (Especially when I pay the majority) But he also doesn't clean. He's never touched the vacuum, never fed the cat, never bleached the bathroom or wiped down counters. Hes never wiped his friends' piss off my toilet seats, picked up trash and beer bottles alone, never changed cat litter, did laundry, or made the bed... nothing. I do it ALL. All while in immense pain and with bouts of extreme nausea. He is fully aware of this, and doesnt care. I am so hurt.\n\n\u00a0I broke the other day when we got home from work and I just wanted to shower and go to bed becuase I was covered in grease, fuel, and oil and was in a lot of pain. He hadn't lifted a finger at work and was wide awake so without talking to me about it 1st, suddenly his friend pulls up in the driveway right behind us. (Que me being unable to sleep due to living in such a small house and their voices rattling the walls.)\n\nTo be entirely honest, I feel like a mother caring for her multiple children. I don't have friends so I am not sure if this is normal behavior for adults, especially adults so close to their 30's... AITA?"

One day, the cabin will be passed down to myself, my sisters, and my cousins. \n\nI (28F) grew up coming here almost every summer with my family. I still have great memories in that cabin. My aunt lives in a house a few hundred yards in one direction of the cabin, while my uncle lives a few hundred yards in the opposite direction.\n\nMay 2020: my sister (24F) moved in the cabin with the intention of staying there \u201cjust for the summer\u201d. She landed a bartending job where she is paid in cash.\n\nFall 2020: my partner (34M) and I move into the cabin with my sister. He landed a great job nearby, so we decided to live in the cabin while looking for a house to buy. At this time, they three of us begin paying the electric, water and gas bills.\n\nJune 2021: my partner and I move out of the cabin and into our new house.\n\nToday: my aunt invites me over to her house for lunch. After eating, she reminds me that there\u2019s a few misc. items of mine that my partner left in the cabin. She (my aunt) also needed to grab a few items of her own in the cabin, so we casually went to the cabin together (Note: my sister is at work and not at the cabin). There\u2019s never been locks on the cabin doors because it\u2019s meant to be accessible to all. When we enter, I\u2019m pretty surprised with how many personal items of mine were still in the cabin. My aunt helped me gather my things, packed them into my car, and I went home. \n\nTonight: I received long, furious texts from my sister. She\u2019s offended/upset that I, \u201cjust came over here without even telling her\u201d while she, \u201cwasn\u2019t home and just helped myself into the house without saying a word to her\u201d. She said that what I did was disrespectful. What I did was \u201ca violation of privacy\u201d and reminded me that I used to hate the feeling of our aunt or uncle coming to the cabin while we weren\u2019t there. She ended by saying, \u201cI understand this is everyone\u2019s house, but I\u2019m living in it right now.\u201d \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t expect to go to the cabin today. I was only on the property to eat lunch with my aunt. It just sort of happened.\n\nOn one hand: I feel like shit. She\u2019s right- I didn\u2019t like my aunt or uncle coming into the cabin while we weren\u2019t there. She\u2018s also stayed in the cabin for over a year. Her life is in there. She\u2019s paid bills and has my family\u2019s permission to live there.\n\nOn the other hand: it\u2019s not her cabin. She doesn\u2019t own it or even pay rent. If my aunt/uncle/mom want to go in there at any hour of the day, they can because they own it. If she wants total privacy where no one can enter her living space, then (instead of mooching off our family\u2019s estate) she can join the rest of society and rent an apartment or buy a house with all the $ she\u2019s accumulated.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly frustrated and can\u2019t figure out who is at fault here since I own that cabin just as much as she does. \n\nAITA for not telling my sister I was going to the cabin when she wasn\u2019t home to retrieve my personal items?"

But I have told him over and over that something is wrong with the plumbing. When people came to look through the house, they came in the night after the drains had backed up, again, and noticed sediment in the bathtub because I had no way to flush the line and clean it. I explained to them that we\u2019d been having trouble with the plumbing and that I had told our landlord but only minimal things had been done to fix it. I suggested that they get someone specifically to check the plumbing if they decided to put the place under contract.\n\nWhen my landlord found out that I had mentioned something to them through the realtor, his response to my father was \u201cwhy did she tell them??\u201d. As if I am going to keep something that serious a secret with literal sediment and god knows what else LITERALLY sitting in my bathtub when they showed up.\n\nLast night, my landlord came over and proceeded to finally fix the leaking sink, add a vent to it, and fiddled with the pump and float. Hes come over 2 days in a row now to do stuff that should have been done months ago. All because the inspectors come today. Well.. They came. And we uncovered a massive lie, what the regulations say, and just how bad the system really is. The man told us that the system was severely clogged. He showed myself and the possible buyer the sewer clean out pipe. Looking in, all you see is dirt and.. Again.. God knows what. When I told them that he was over fiddling with the float the night before, he asked what other work had been done. So I was honest. I said that they had hand dug the line when they\u2019d replaced everything two years prior when his son had lived there. I also explained that in the past 2 days he\u2019d been over and fixed the sink, added the vent, and replaced the pump. The buyer asked about permits, because she had been told by landlord that he had gotten permits and it had all been done to code when he\u2019d fixed it two years ago. The inspector actually called and looked into that, finding no evidence of permits or inspections to prove that the work was done right. Meaning that the system has never been up to code.\n\nMy question to you guys is this. Am I the asshole, for not allowing him to swindle these poor people into buying this home with a possible $7000 or more bill that will come up right after buying it\u2026? My landlord seems to think so."

We became friends at work and everything was cool at first but things started to become sour after a while. The details aren't that important, but he started to become very short and rude with me for seemingly no reason. When I asked him what was up, Nathaniel stated that I \"hovered\" too much at work. \n\nBy hovering he meant that I walked over to him when he came over to the customer desk to talk to him. (The customer desk has a wall of bins where we put items that need to go back on the shelves). I don't think that's entirely why, but that's the only reason he would say. I, of course, gave him space at work even though I continued to help him by giving him rides to work. Nathaniel was still snippy and rude to me sometimes for no reason, but I figured he was having a hard time so I brushed his comments off.\n\nNow onto the issue. A few days ago we were working together at the same time. At this point we haven't really talked for a while/I haven't given him any rides recently because my schedule changed. I was helping my manager (Rosie) out by bagging items for her because she asked. Rosie asked me to leave to go help customers at the customer desk. \n\nAfter I come back from helping the other customers, Nathaniel is standing by the bag carousel waiting for Rosie to be done with the transaction. Because I had been helping her previously, I move to help Rosie with the bags only to realize she doesn't need any help. I move out of the way. \n\nLater on right before I'm about to go home for the day and I'm saying goodbye, Nathaniel berates me in front of a customer. He's upset because he thinks I made him look incompetent by moving the grocery bags even though he was there. I'm stunned that he's upset by that and leave without any further word. \n\nI text him some admittedly rude and truthful things by calling him insecure, and he calls me a bad friend.  I don't think we're friends anymore but maybe I'm in the wrong and I just don't realize it. My boyfriend and roommate are on my side but I know they're probably biased, so Reddit AITA?\n\ntldr; I move bags in front of coworker to help manager, he gets mad because he thinks that means I think he's incompetent"

Following to her pregnancy I was basically on a daily routine of checking up making sure she had all she needed exct, I would try to visit but she wouldn\u2019t allow bc of the pandemic but in turn she would post pictures of her at restaurants with her friends. At first it rubbed me wrong but then I said well maybe it\u2019s because my husband is a first responder. I brushed it off, well quarantine brought my husband and I out most desired gift of all a baby! We were over the moon but very wary on I was having complications so in fear of the unknown we kept it to purser I told her in excitement I asked her if she would do the honor of my gender reveal. So we get to the gender reveal and I\u2019m expecting almost the same effort and excitement as I did for her, but literally got a pair of tshirts that said it\u2019s a girl and that was it. No decor, no food ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. We left right after receiving the shirts because her bf wanted to smoke w33d. I cried hard. I brushed it off as being hormonal. Following to her babyshower she asked to use my house I said yeah no prob. She then told me she was also expecting me to make the cake . I said cool no problem. I even ended up decorating because she literally threw all the decor in my house and asked me to do it. Thru out the whole babyshower it was the same as the gender reveal all attention on all her friends and I basically had to beg her to take a picture with me. Also I gifted her a 200$ breast pump on top of all I did . Well she posted all her pictures with all her friend and not one of me. Didn\u2019t even thank me for anything then left the mess for my husband and I to clean. So my babyshower my mom planned for me because she said she didn\u2019t have the time. She showed up high as hell and smelling like straight w33d was there for about 5 min then left. So a few days ago she called me to tell me that her daughters birthday party was coming up and that she was expecting me to make a cake ONE cake. I said okay cool being the nice person I am. Then like 2 days ago she called and told me she wants two cakes the main cake being a two tiered cake and the second being one sole cake just as nicely decorated. Might I add ive been struggling bad with my mental health and she hasn\u2019t checked on me not once. (Not that she has to but just saying since I\u2019ve done the same and more) Would it be wrong if I said I didn\u2019t want to make anything?"

I said he can pick out whatever but I only had about $10-$15 in extra cash so it had to be less than that.\n\nI get my soda and candy and stand in line. There are about 8 people ahead of me and a few behind me in the line. He comes up with a sandwich and a Hurricane (which is a $3 or so malt beer 40 oz). He was about 10 feet away and I was smiling uncomfortably and I said something along the lines of \u201c I\u2019m sorry but I said I\u2019ll get you food and I don\u2019t feel comfortable buying that drink\u201d. People in line were looking at me and he started yelling out (in a joking manner) \u201coh so now you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m not allowed to drink?\u201d\n\nIn my head I just thought \u201cyou can drink all you want if you want but not on my dime\u201d, but out loud I just said \u201cI\u2019m sorry but no\u201d and I kind of trailed off awkwardly.\n\nBasically I left the line, grabbed him a random breakfast sandwich, got back in line, bought it and handed it to him and kinda rushed out of the store.\n\nI was truly embarrassed because I felt like I was being controlling to a grown man and stranger, and everyone in line witnessed his outburst. I do feel guilty about telling him I would buy him something then later being specific to what I would get him. I will take any judgement. AITA?"

She claims she\u2019s softer because she\u2019s her last child. But the child is a brat. For context, when she once came over with the kids she asked if I could give her oldest a sandwich as he didn\u2019t like their healthy lunch they had. The second child - let\u2019s call her Layla had eaten all her lunch, but kicked off and demanded a sandwich like her brother to the point where she made herself throw up. I\u2019m a single parent with two kids and I\u2019m happy to give what I can to hungry kids, but perishable foods such as bread, milk, cereal etc I need for my own kids and don\u2019t really want to hand out to a kid that isn\u2019t even hungry. But I had to give her a sandwich. She also always goes in my cupboards and demands cereal that she doesn\u2019t even end up eating, but my cousin will always help herself to my food. Granted, my cousin is always happy to feed my kids if we go over to hers (which is rare) but it\u2019s gotten to the point where I will avoid having them over because I can\u2019t stand Layla\u2019s behaviour. \n\nAnyway, the other day they came over. I had just built a \u00a3300 outdoor sofa that I had treated myself to on a monthly payment plan. Her kids ended up staining the fabric on the first day I had it before I\u2019ve even had the chance to enjoy it properly, but I get that kids will be kids and it was going to happen sooner or later with my own so I wasn\u2019t annoyed about that (although they weren\u2019t very apologetic) \n\nWhat I\u2019m annoyed about though is all the kids were having ice lolly\u2019s - my youngest (1 1/2F) was sat on my lap having hers. Layla came over to her dad and demanded they swap lollies. So he did. My cousin then asked me to make her a cup of tea so I asked her to sit with my youngest whilst she ate. I came back out to find Layla with my daughters lolly and my daughter with the one that she had (which was originally laylas dads). Not only did my daughter have more left of her lolly, Layla\u2019s was also dirty from her climbing on stuff. The dad tried to call her out, but she simply said that my daughters was also dirty (it wasn\u2019t). She didn\u2019t seem to think there was anything wrong with what she\u2019d done. I didn\u2019t say anything because I\u2019m not good with confrontation especially with family, but I\u2019m trying to work on boundaries and I can\u2019t stop thinking about this incident.\n\nSo.. WIBTA if I text her now and pretty much call her out on it and tell her I won\u2019t allow that behaviour in my house towards my own children?"

For background, I\u2019m a 22yo(F) who had to move with my sister(31) 8 hours away from my Mom(51), Dad(62) and brother(30),however I\u2019m a 5 minute drive from the majority of my mom\u2019s relatives. My siblings grew up w my cousins but the age gap left me out. Although they weren\u2019t cruel to me, they didn\u2019t go out of their way to be nice to me either. The cousins my age were boys, so my mom basically isolated me my entire childhood.\nI guess you could say I look like a wannabe E-Girl, who\u2019s hyperactive, random and likes to smoke ouid. My moms already on my ass about how I dress and what I like so I\u2019m used to being shut down. I\u2019m awkward as all hell around people and have anxiety, especially at family events, I\u2019d always cry at least once. This time it was a nephews birthday. His mom is the sweetest but my cousin isn\u2019t the best spouse to her so I decided to go support her. I got all dressed up in a long vintage skirt, and a crop top, really feeling cute. When I arrived, I could see my cousins pointing and laughing in my direction. \nCus#1: Omg OP, who\u2019s you\u2019re brand?\nMe: What?\nCus#2: cmon cuh #1, you ruined it.The rest of them started laughing. \nMe: uhh goodwill*insert my awkward laugh*\nCus #3: OP, are you high?\nMe: no? Followed by that annoying ass \u201cahhhhhhh\u201d that people do when they think youre lying. I feel myself start to shrink as I take a seat next to my sister, correcting them that I have glaucoma (her excuse when she\u2019s high). Cousin #4 sat down next to me and started to catch up. She started asking me some sensitive questions about a breakup I recently had before being interrupted. Cus #3: \u201cOP look at me\u2026Oh yea, that\u2019s glaucoma alright\u201d with everyone howling with laughter. I laughed weakly and turned back to hesitantly answer cousin #4\u2019s question. She was shocked and said something that made me feel like an awful person. Overwhelmed, trembling and about to cry, I grabbed my things and made my way to the door, staring at the ground. I didn\u2019t think anyone noticed since no one stopped me. As soon as I get to my car, i sob the entire drive home. I vented to my mom the next day, but she just tells me \u201cMaybe it\u2019s cause you don\u2019t look cute? You shouldn\u2019t take your family\u2019s criticism to heart, they just want what\u2019s best for you. Now you made things weird for them. Even if you like whatever it is your wearing, you really shouldn\u2019t wear it if someone points out that it\u2019s ugly. You have to apologize.\u201d \nI feel so outcasted. I really don\u2019t agree with what she said but she\u2019s my mom and \u201cI have to listen to her\u201d so idk if I should\u2019ve just stuck it out and just let it happen rather than the backlash from my sudden disappearance. I grew up as a little obedient girl who never talked back and always did as I was told, but where does that leave me now? A people pleasing doormat who doesn\u2019t know how to stand up themselves. The strict gender norms and the constant religious brainwashing has broken me. AITA??"

In May 2020, my BFs family bought a property with the idea to move there and start up a campground. I was told I could be involved or not, but I chose to be involved and move with the family. In June 2020, my BF and I ordered a tiny home. Since the property was still so new and there was no place for everyone to stay, we obviously let everyone stay in and use the house. My BF and I only had one rule: clean up after yourself. \n\nOf course that didn\u2019t go well. I felt like a maid and a mother, constantly cleaning up after these grown adults. Eventually after 6 months the problem became so bad (the house was trashed and looked more like a storage shed), we asked them to move out (at this point there was an RV on the property that was set up to live in). \n\nHowever, there was still some entitlement going on. People were just bursting into our house with no knock, no warning, no respect, and using our things without asking. My BF and I asked if people would knock before coming in because it was our house and our space, trying to set boundaries. We knocked anytime we went to their RV. They didn\u2019t listen. So I started keeping the door locked 24/7, whether we were there or not. Suddenly my BFs father is calling me a child, saying that I\u2019m just throwing a tantrum, and that I need to make a list of my boundaries so HE can decide if they\u2019re reasonable or not. \n\nI ask if I\u2019m the asshole or not because it\u2019s not my property, they are allowing me to live on the land."

Since I'm bi, I'm lucky (?) to live in the most liberal region of my country although that doesn't mean much since we're still pretty conservative as far as Europe/EU goes. However all my classmates and friends (that I came out to) accept me, it's the older primitive people who cause most problems like usual and my own dad is one of those people, which makes me pretty depressed.\n\nI want to come out to my family badly but at the same time I don't/can't because they're so complicated. Like I said, my dad is pretty much a traditional man who doesn't accept the LGBT community. He hates that we have pride parades, thinks that we should have anti-LGBT laws like Hungary or Russia. So right now, telling him my sexuality is out of the question.\n\nBut somehow my mom is the bigger problem because I don't understand what she believes. When my dad sees something LGBT-related on the news and gets homophobic, she tells him he's a primitive weirdo and \"why do you care?\" But it's more like friendly arguing, my mom doesn't try to change my dad's opinions.\n\nMy dad actually asked me recently, bc some of my male friends have girlfriends, when I'm going to bring a girl home from school. I mostly ignored him, said that I don't care about dating, but my mom asked him unprovoked: \"Why are you saying a girl? What if he brings a boy home?\"\n\nThat really surprised me. My dad replied: \"Then he would have to buy a tent and live on the street\" which honestly felt like being stabbed through the heart. But my mom only tapped my shoulder and rolled her eyes, she didn't say anything else.\n\nMy friends know about all this \"home drama\" btw. Which is now the main issue because they're all telling me my mom is going to be supportive and I have to tell her I'm bi.\n\nI got into an argument yesterday with my best friend because he says I'm paranoid and overanalyze everything, that I'm treating my mom like she's evil because she doesn't get into fights with my dad.\n\nI understand why my friends say I should come out to my mom, because I'm depressed about my family not knowing my sexuality, that I'm flirting and talking to a boy, and yeah I complain about being depressed a lot... Without a solution... I know I put a burden on my friends and I'm trying to not do that so much. I'm even looking for a psychologist.\n\nBut if you ask me, I'm afraid that my mom will always conform to my dad. If I tell her I'm bi, will she tell him against my will? I'm afraid she will never stand up for me against my dad. Maybe that's the paranoid thinking that my friends criticize me for, though.\n\nSo my question is this: am I being an asshole to myself and my mom for assuming things about her? AITA to my friends for thinking their opinions are worth less because it's not their home life? Do I spend too much time thinking instead of acting?"

I started out as a contracted, full-time employee but then had my daughter (4F) and asked to be switched to per diem, which allowed me to work less hours and have more flexibility.\n\nNow, one of my coworkers at another wing of the same hospital is Dani (38F). Over the years, I have heard comments about her not putting in the work or slacking off, but our specialty is very much in demand in our area and I guess that\u2019s why she never really suffered any consequences. Dani also works per diem, as she has a contracted part-time job elsewhere. Almost two years ago, she got pregnant. She told me she intended to stay home with her son for the first few months, and asked me if I would cover her shifts at this other wing so they wouldn\u2019t bring in someone else. Since it was only going to be about 6 months, I said yes.\n\nThe thing was\u2026 Her baby was born, six months passed, and while she went back to her other job (being a contracted employee, she had to), she kept telling me to hold on just a little longer because she was \u201cadjusting\u201d to getting back to work. A few more months passed and she kept telling me the same thing. At this point, I had already adjusted to working that many hours again and was okay with it, but I don\u2019t deal well with uncertainty and the not knowing was really wearing me down, so I told her that I hadn\u2019t signed up for subbing for her for this long, that I needed to find something more stable and long term for myself and that I was going to talk to HR about getting someone else to replace her if she didn\u2019t come back. She said she would come back \u201csoon\u201d. She didn\u2019t. So I went to HR, let them know that I wanted to go back to my old wing only, and they let me know that they thought I had done a really good job and were interested in keeping me long term. They ended up offering me a contract to work both this new wing and my old one and when I asked what about Dani, they told me that she would be welcome to take up any shifts that arose upon need, but that she probably wouldn\u2019t have as many hours as she used to. They talked me into believing it was her fault for leaving me (and them) hanging and I ended up accepting the contract.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I might have been TA: I asked them to talk to her about it and didn\u2019t tell her anything myself. I thought it was their responsibility, since it hadn\u2019t been my initiative and I had solely accepted their offer. It took her a couple of months to contact me again, letting me know she was coming back, and I realized immediately HR hadn\u2019t talked to her. So I told her to talk to them. Not even one hour later, she calls me absolutely fuming and calling me all sorts of names for blindsiding her and asking me if I was the \u201cb\\*\\*\\*\\*\u201d who had her job now. I feel really bad for not telling her now, but I truly thought that they would talk to her back then so I never thought about it again. AITA?"

Everyone just got all quiet, and some people said I was being a bit harsh even if I was right. \n\nIdk am I the asshole for blowing up because she kept bringing it up?"

Even while I\u2019m in between jobs I spend my free time doing things that will pay so I can help her with bills and maintaining the house. The problem here is that she\u2019s getting hammered nearly everyday regardless of wether she has work (she drinks with her boss, they\u2019re good friends). This is an issue for me as it means I spend my entire day looking after the other kids while my mom is hungover. This is every day. I\u2019ve asked repeatedly for her to stop as it\u2019s causing issues with my personal life and she tells me if I don\u2019t like it I can leave (I have no where else to go I haven\u2019t seen my father since I was 2 and I don\u2019t really want to leave my siblings alone with her). This morning she was on the phone to her friend crying telling her how she does everything for us and we\u2019re never happy with it. Just for some more information, me and my oldest sister(14f) were raised very strictly with solid rules to follow and we turned out quite respectable. My youngest sister is a monster. I mean it. She will torment everyone in the house to a point where nobody wants to be around her. At all. And my mom refuses to acknowledge this and when i take it upon myself to tell her what she\u2019s doing is wrong or punish her by removing her IPHONE 7 from her I am called a bully and my mom says I\u2019m not supposed to punish her as I\u2019m \u201cjust her brother\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cnot your place\u201d. She even called me hitler before because I didn\u2019t let her get away with her bullshit all the time. Yes that\u2019s right, my own mother called me hitler. Anyway AITA?"

My siblings, all older, were 11, 12, 14 and 16. My stepmother had a hard time with us. She was very inconsiderate at first. Or at least very blunt and had very unrealistic expectations about what she was getting. She said some things early on about being over our moms death, about her being our new mom and that really old timey way of thinking that she was the real mom now that she was married to our dad and our mom was dead. It took threeish years of her to realize how fucked up that stuff was. She did work on it. But it soured all of us to her.\n\nAll my siblings have kids and all of them honored the grandparents (mom, dad and their in-law's) in their names. Now I'm expecting my first baby with my husband and we had an idea for an honor name that would honor both my mom and his mom while also giving our daughter her own name. We also picked out a boy name that would do the same should we ever have a boy, because we started name talk early in my pregnancy. My stepmother mentioned to me how much she hopes she won't be the only one excluded from being honored with my kids. That it has hurt her a lot to see both sides honored in grandkid (though she's not called grandma by any of my siblings kids) names and not be given any sort of nod. She didn't say it but what she meant was especially because she's not given a grandma title or level of relationship with the kids.\n\nI did warn her that her name would not appear in my daughters name and she told me it was so unfair. That her actions in the beginning hurt us but she has done everything to make up for it and she gets no love, no appreciation and she's treated like that's how she always behaves. And that me being the youngest she hoped she had repaired things enough to be given something. Then she told me I was being unfair, more than my siblings, because she not only confided in me but raised me for a large part of my childhood. She ended up leaving pissed off and she's made it clear she is mad at me.\n\nNow part of me feels bad for not feeling bad. Because she did try to learn and grow from her past actions that hurt me and my siblings. Yet it has influenced a lot of this. But I know I am hurting her and I know she's feeling very rejected and unwanted and part of me wonders if she's right.\n\nAITA?"

I won't have any help on that day and they didn't have any appointments available on the days I do have help (Wed/Tues). \n\nWhen I asked him to come along.

I don't know if it's relevant but he is relatively new at this job but is doing very well. \n\nI feel like the follow up comments are unnecessary because I wouldn't be asking if I didn't need the help.

I'm already feeling overwhelmed by everything and I feel like he should've said \"I'll be there\" period. But his response makes me feel like he's guilting me for asking. He feels like I have no basis to be annoyed at his comment and am overreacting. AITA for being annoyed?"

I grew up in this community and have taken the house over from my parents.\n\nOver the years the community has changed quite a bit and especially in the last 3-4 years we have had more and more conflicts. Most of the time it comes down to families with kids vs elderly/families without kids. Stuff like kids playing on the street (legal, it is a \"Spielstra\u00dfe\"), kids being loud outside. Another big point is that the house and garden designs. Some families have big BBQ places in their garden or swimming pools or swingsets and so on. A family recently painted their house in a pastel color. This is often a point of conflict as some people claim it \"devalues\" the neighbourhood. \n\nOne of my closer neighbours has recently started campaigning for a legal construct in the way of american homeowner associations (he specifically refers to that). Essentially he wants all the neighbours to sign a legal contract that would force them to comply to certain rules set by an elected committee. \n\nHe introduced this to a smaller group of neighbours, including me during a dinner. The way he described it made it sound like a wonderful idea that benefits everyone. Except that I have known him for years and my family had quite a few conflicts with him when I was a child. So during the dinner, I pretty much immediatly shot down the idea, that I would never sign up for something like this and would actively advice others against it. Things got heated and he demanded to know why I would want our neighbourhood to \"turn into trash pile\". \n\nSo I brought up all the times he expressed his hatred for kids playing, for any decoration/design/garden that he deemed an abomination, the fact he got kicked out of a Schrebergarten committee for being too much of a rules freak. Yes I know, it was pretty much a personal attack but I honestly thing he is a horrible person.\n\nMy wife and I got kicked out of the dinner of course. She later told me while she agreed with me, I should have been nicer and that his plan would probably not work anyway. Another neighbour, who I consider a good friend, also mentioned that the whole thing probably wouldn't even work legally.   \n\n\nI don't know (and don't really care) if it is legal, if it is feasible, if it will probably not work out. I think people like that sometimes need to be called out and this judgmental, elitist attitude is just god awful."

I understand that noise is part of apartment living but think loud music between 1am-4am is something that can be avoided. It\u2019s understandable if it happens occasionally but it seems to be a constant issue. I was up at 3.30am this morning, asked them to turn the music down and only managed to go back to sleep at 5am despite having to wake up an hour later.

The wife and I have hectic work schedules and trying to find city street parking is almost impossible. The LL also told us that the neighbor (NBR) is a single father with 2 kids. This place seemed perfect.\n\nHow naive were we. The 1st week we moved in, NBR had allowed their visitors to park their cars in our parking spaces. The first 3 weeks or so we knocked on the door and politely asked them to move their cars. They always did, but when we knocked on their door for the 100th time it just became a nuisance. After talking to the NBR there seemed to be no progress although frequently given fake promises. We also started to notice that his visitors seemed to be living off their vehicles.\n\nTalking to the NBR directly didn't seem to fix the problem so we decided to talk to the LL. LL tells us to have patience with NBR since \"they are not used to sharing\". So my wife and I did. \n\nParking was not the only issue, NBR also threw parties everyday from 2p- 4a, not exaggerating. There were constantly 10+ adults fighting with music bumping through our walls. The thin wall is also how we found out that the NBR is a drug dealer and allows his clients / friends to use/ live (?) at his house. Which is why they rarely slept / acted rational/ or left the property. \n\n4th &amp;5th  month came and went, nothing had changed. NBR became irrational and it just made everything uncomfortable.\n\n6th month, we simply sent a text to the LL that read \"We will not be paying rent this month until our parking situation is cleared up\".\n\nThe rest of the story is simply not what we imagined. The whole ordeal happened on the other side of the wall. At 10 am the LL knocks on the NBR door and is let in. The LL quickly realizes that his whole house is a mess. Finds drugs, broken property &amp; ect. Voices were raised and amongst the chaos we clearly hear the LL say \"I only came cause the NBR are complaining about the parking spots..You have 30 days to get out or I'll call the police\". Later LL replies text with \"NBR is leaving in 30 days\".\n\nOf course, NBR and all his friends are pissed. However, the wife and I did not want them to be evicted. We were shocked. We just wanted our parking spots. Now a family and \\~ 10+ other people are homeless. I can't help but feel like we might have been assholes here by refusing to pay rent. \n\n**TL;DR: Neighbor is a drug dealer who houses 10+ of his clients who are presumably homeless and allows them to park their cars in our parking spots. We refused to pay rent to the landlord until our parking was secured. Causing landlords to go inside the neighbors house and realize what was really going on and evicting them on the spot.**"

            "text": " I have been married to my husband for three years now, together for six. He has joint custody of Ben (7M), a kid from a previous relationship.\n\nNow, Ben had some health issues when he was younger. Because of this, he used to have speech therapy at school, but he got just \u201cgood enough\u201d that he stopped qualifying for it through the school and now he goes to an outpatient clinic for it. However, his sessions are always during working hours and since I am a freelancer, I volunteered to be the one to pick him up and take him to therapy, even when it\u2019s not our week with him. We started going about two months ago.\n\nHere\u2019s my issue: On the car ride home, when Ben is telling me about what he did in therapy, he will often say that his therapist was \u201cworking on her phone\u201d while he worked. At first, I thought it was probably nothing, but he mentioned this often, so I asked the therapist if it would be possible for me to sit in on one of the sessions. She wasn\u2019t very happy with the idea, as she says children usually focus better without an adult there, but she let me do it. I found her to be very disengaged, basically giving him a worksheet and leaving him to his own devices while he does it. This is obviously not my area of expertise and I don\u2019t have any prior experience to compare this to, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way. So I asked for some tips and strategies that I could use at home with him and she sent me away with this very generic written list of strategies without any guidance on how to apply them. Ever since, I have been sitting in the waiting room while Ben is inside per her request, but they have to have the door slightly ajar (ventilation things, Covid rules) and I barely hear either of their voices. Ben continues to report that she \u201cworks on her phone\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s what I think: She hands materials to Ben and then stays on her phone most of the time. This is just a hunch, of course, but I get really shady vibes from this. So I told my husband about this and told him that I thought we needed to request a new therapist.

So I told them plain and simple I wasn\u2019t going to take him next week.\n\nBen\u2019s mother got really angry with me, saying I am putting Ben in jeopardy by not taking him, because if I don\u2019t take him, nobody else will. She is making me feel very guilty and has been texting me almost every day trying to get me to change my mind, and now I\u2019m wondering if by doing this I really am not doing good by Ben and if I\u2019m wrong in standing my ground.

Well with my dogs my father In-law is the absolute worst. I have had to restrict so many things from him with my two dogs because he just won\u2019t listen. I have to now feed the dogs inside away from him because he would hover over them because he thinks one of my dog is food aggressive\u2026she is not in the slightest. I told him he can\u2019t walk them anymore because one of our dogs is leash aggressive and he cannot walk them correctly and refuses to learn, even after MULTIPLE times of showing and teaching. The dogs aren\u2019t allowed upstairs now after dark because he won\u2019t stop playing with them and it keeps my kids awake downstairs. He\u2019s already thrown a tantrum and threaten to move out when I told him he can\u2019t walk the dogs and says I was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. Now my dogs won\u2019t eat, one is becoming obese. They are very active dogs but I\u2019m fairly certain he is feeding them human food upstairs. This has been an issue in the past but when we lived separate but currently I have no way to prove it. AITA if I just cut him off from the dogs? The dogs love him but he undermines every single thing we tell him or ask him not to do."

            "text": "So here is some back story to help understand my dilemma. My oldest (23m) has been engaged to his fianc\u00e9 (22f) for 6 years. \nThey had a wedding they asked me to help plan (she asked me to plan the whole thing, she only picked the venue after I showed her locations) for them in Vegas a couple months ago.\nWell they fly there a day early and she changes her mind. She made my son call and say don't be mad, fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to get married here. She wants to get married with her family (dad, sister and brother) her mother passed when she was 15.\nI honestly didn't care, but she told my son I forced her into the wedding. I don't know how I forced her when she bugged me for weeks to take her to get a Vegas wedding dress (she bought a white wedding gown for their after the Coov wedding). I told them both that it's their life and their future they should do what makes them happy. \nI was passed because his fianc\u00e9 said a honeymoon in Vegas would be fun and I asked would you want to do your wedding their as well? I offered to pay for their hotel. So she said heck yes and asked me to please plan all of it for her cuz she stresses to easily. \nSo come to the next day when everyone else flys to Vegas.\nHis brothers (21m and 19m), my best friend and her kids (who are best friends with my boys), my ex-husband (their dad) showed up as well.  \nWe all decided to still enjoy ourselves.\nI forgot to add that she doesn't speak to her dad (drug addict) and she doesn't speak to her twin sister either, they had a falling out. We are still struggling to get along with his fianc\u00e9 even after 6yrs. She is rude, ignores us (we don't see her for days), she yells at all my boys when she doesn't get her way and is lazy, a hoarder and has pitched in with chores less than 6 times in the 2yrs she has lived here. I believe she is verbally abusive to my son, she yells at him, calls him names, criticizes him, puts him down also she can NEVER EVER admit when she is wrong.\nI have unfortunately stood up for my son and told her flat out don't make me choose because it will always be my son. Unless of course he cheats, abuses her or is an AH.\nFYI my husband and I bought a bigger house so all our boys can live with us.\nMy problem is if she didn't want to get married in Vegas that's fine but to blame me and put it all on me as my fault that is why I'm hurt and pissed.\n\nSo after the whole Vegas wedding debacle am I the AH for telling them both don't ask me to help in any way shape or form with your wedding. \n\nSorry for the long explanation and hopefully it's not confusing and makes sense lol."

Our original plan was to get married and go straight home. But it hasn't gone that way and I've planned a really casual party for 40 people.\n\nHere's the issue, my MOH got a new boyfriend. He's a nice guy and I invited him to the reception but they've only been dating a month and so I thought inviting him was pretty generous. She rang me the other day and told me her and her bf would meet me at my house and go up to my dad's together to get ready. I was really jarred and just got off the phone call. I spoke to my dad and my partner and they were both shocked and thought it was completely inappropriate, which I agreed with but I really didn't want to be a bridezilla over it unless it was called for. So I rang her back and told her it was inappropriate for him to come along. \nShe tried to convince me he had to come because he doesn't know how to get to the ceremony. He's not coming to the ceremony, I can have 6 people in the room, our parents and our children. The only other people coming to the ceremony are guests who will be in our photos everyone else is meeting us at the reception.\nI will admit I do have a problem with their relationship. They've been together for just over a month now and are living together, which I would just ignore except she has a kid and she promised me she would take her next relationship slow. She's talking about babies and marriage and instead of buying a bridesmaid dress in the same colour as my other two she's brought a one that has a really busy pattern and isn't my colours at all. She's also coordinated her outfit with her bf and her son's clothing. Again I'll hold my hands up on this one, I told her to buy what makes her comfortable but the dress doesn't fit so I offered to buy her one that she likes but in the wedding colours. She's going to use ribbon to tie it at the back so she can wear it still (again not okay with this). \nNow my other bridemaids are pissed and in an act of rebellion brought completely matching dresses and are both doing their hair and make up the same. At this point I don't want to deal with her anymore and I want to tell her to come to the reception only or just skip it all together, WIBTA?"

I met Brit maybe 4 years ago and have since introduced the two since they lived in the same neighborhood. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed some unbalanced actions on Brit\u2019s part that have left me feeling pretty annoyed and in the dumps. I want to share this with Jess to see if she has noticed too our would mention it to Brit when she sees it, but I don\u2019t want to come off sounding petty. For context, Brit lives for event planning and gifting and always makes a grand ordeal out of everything, wants to see you open gifts in front of her, etc.\n\nLate summer 2019: \n&gt; Jess\u2019s birthday, Brit gets her a large heartfelt gift and *remembers* to bring my birthday gift from spring that is just odds and ends.\n\nFall 2019:\n&gt; Jess and I host small engagement celebration for Brit. My idea.\n&gt; Brit gives us both holiday gifts, again my gift seems thrown together and Jess\u2019s matches her personality perfectly. \n\n2020: \n&gt; The year is a blur, but I send both Jess &amp; Brit birthday gifts and only receive one from Jess. \n&gt; We get together once mid-year, and I bring dessert and mimosas to celebrate Jess\u2019s engagement. \n\nMid-Spring 2021:\n&gt; Finally vaccinated and we all exchange holiday gifts. I give Brit her birthday gift as well. \n\nLate-Spring 2021:\n&gt; At Jess\u2019s bridal shower I catch Brit telling Jess\u2019s relatives that my significant other and I are waiting for both of their weddings to pass before we get engaged\u2026  not the case. \n&gt; I get engaged a week later. Jess sends a gift.\n&gt; My birthday is the following week. No gifts.\n\nEarly-Summer 2021:\n&gt; Brit\u2019s bridal shower and she goes on and on about how the majority of those attending are engaged, their wedding details, etc. She doesn\u2019t mention my engagement at all or ask to see my ring, which of course is the first thing Jess asks to see. Not my day or the place, so I don\u2019t mention it. Brit texts me the following week apologizing that she *just realized* she forgot but also slips that she told her out of town visitors right after the shower\n&gt; I see Brit in person a week later and she has an engagement gift for me. It appears to be things she is getting rid of around the house.\n&gt; I suggest that we plan a small bachelorette day for Jess since she didn\u2019t get one due to COVID. Brit completely takes over and day-of makes it seem like everything was all her idea. \n\nMid-Summer 2021:\n&gt; We go to Brit\u2019s. It happens to be the day after Jess\u2019s birthday. I bring a gift along for Jess. I arrive early and see two gift bags and think that Brit is maybe late again with mine. BOTH gifts turn out being for Jess. \n\nI\u2019m fine with not receiving anything\u2026 especially when it just winds up in a box collecting dust. Rather, I\u2019m annoyed that Brit is either unaware of her comments and actions or is just that over the moon with Jess. I just want it to be \u201cmy turn\u201d for once."

I was told to prepare my presentation for this Wednesday. We still have yet to actually meet about what she expects for the presentation because she cancelled a meeting we had scheduled last week. In her initial emails, she explained that the camp was for young kids.\nSpecifically she said \"This is a teaching session for younger kids, so the information must be interesting and interactive. Quizzes, games, crosswords and other games keep the session interactive and fun for these kids\" \nI'm really passionate about science communication and outreach in the community so I was interested in volunteering. I found a flyer for the camp and it showed images of elementary and middle school aged children.\nNaturally, from all of that I gathered that this is a Summer camp for children-- the kind of camp that parents sign their kids up for so that they can feel good about their kids learning some science during their summer break.\nApparently I was wrong.\nI got an email at midnight tonight saying that she expects me to give a 2 hour interactive presentation to highschool students that are taking college level biology courses. This is not the fun outreach program for kids I thought it was. It's a camp for students trying to get ahead before they start college so they can make it to medical school. \nMind you, I'm not getting paid for any of this. It's entirely volunteer based. \nWIBTA if I responded to this professor's email saying that I wasn't informed of the true purpose of the camp, was not given sufficient time to prepare such a detailed presentation, and will be not be volunteering?\n\nI'm on mobile so apologies for any weird formatting or spelling errors."

At fast food places he will ask her to forgo cheese on her burger in order to knock a few cents off. Out at dinner places he has asked her to forgo a drink off the menu and just fill up on water, has suggested when they're paying that we downgrade our meat choices for the option that is usually a dollar cheaper. Once he even asked me and my boyfriend and his niece and her friend to swap out our regular lasagna's for the kid lasagna to save a few bucks. At Christmas before everything went to crap the gift they bought his mom was given to her and he actually complained about how much it cost. Apparently he's given his sister kids jewelry before to save money.\n\nAnyway, me and my boyfriend were out with them, some of my mom's family and some of his family and I saw him start to do it again.

He said I was a rude little brat and I told him I was standing up for my mom who deserves to be treated better. \n\nHe still thinks I was rude, and some of my mom's family thought I was rude to bring it up as well, at least in front of everyone at dinner and since I'm not his daughter or particularly close to him.\n\nAITA?"

            "text": "Throwaway just in case.\n\nMy sister had a child when she was fifteen years old and although it was hard my family supported her. We all pitched in from time to time to help out but since I was young I only really pitched it when really necessary. Due to lack of a solid education, my sister went back to school, got a diploma and found a job (kudos to her, it can't have been easy at the time) That's all well and good, it was an accident and we moved past it. \n\nMy issue starts here. About 5 years ago my sister and her new partner of about 4 years at that point were living with myself and my parents and decided to have another baby. To me the fact that they didn't even think to discuss with us the idea of having another baby in the family house was selfish.\n\nThe children are now 5 and 12. I've seen them being ignored because both parents are usually stuck on their phones. Being spoiled (paid off) with gifts because both parents are heavily invested in their careers. Parents also show a lack of love for one another (Almost divorced twice in the last few years) I still harbour this anger due to feeling like the decision was selfish, I try not to take it out on the children because they are the victims here if anything.\n\nMy biggest issue is this, however. My mother is the type of person to always try to help others even when it doesn't help her. Every day the kids come over after school from around 2 till around 5. Often longer because both parents decide to work late. My mother works from 8 till 2 then has to babysit but her idea of babysitting is watching Netflix or work while they are on their iPads.\n\nMy problem with the above is the expectation for me to do what my mother does and go out of my way to take care of them when they won't. Whenever I say that I can't or won't they get defensive and call me an asshole. I genuinely don't mind staying with the kids and giving them my attention as I feel they really want it but since they're at my mum's house so often I worry that my 5-year-old niece will get attached to me and my partner and always come to us when she's home when I think she should be with her parents. She already does this very often as she wants someone to play with which breaks my heart.\n\nNow next week my niece starts summer school and my mum is working two days from the office so they are asking me to pick my 5 yo niece up from school at 11:30 for an hour when my mum is not home. (I work full-time remotely from home). I'm fine with doing it but the feeling of hate for my sister and her partner makes me angry and resentful. I know they can make it work between them to take an afternoon off twice a week to be with their bloody children but they don't and I do not want to encourage them by having to take care of their child. She needs her parents, not her uncle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for arguing this?"

Let\u2019s name them \u201cT\u201d,  \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cJ\u201d. So, ever since I started playing ps4 with them again I\u2019ve noticed B and J talk a lot of shit to T. (I get shit talking is normal in video games) but they do it to the point we\u2019re it\u2019s kind of toxic. So I started standing up for T whenever B and J got toxic, nothing too crazy, just telling B and J to drop it, or something along those lines. At first they just dropped it and didn\u2019t say anything but after a while, they would tell me to \u201cbe quiet\u201d, \"stfu OP\" or to \u201cstay out of it\u201d whenever they\u2019re being toxic to him. \n\nI guess J is probably the one being the most bothered about me standing up for T. He manages to bring up T in conversations that don\u2019t have anything to do with him. For example we were playing Fortnite the other day (call me a fortnite kid or whatever) and I just jokingly said \"Oh no, the tryhard\" as J was trying to kill me, that's when he got really defensive and said \"Oh, but when T fights you, you don't say anything.\" We got into an argument because I told him how what I said didn't have anything to do with T, and I didn't see the point of even bringing him up. He said that I always defend him, (I'm not sure how to explain, but the way he said it made it seem like it was a bad thing).\n\nB has criticized me, because according to him I don't stand up for him when they get toxic with him. However, I haven't heard anyone being toxic to him, or else I would defend him in a heartbeat. I've asked him when it has happened or what they have said to him (I asked because I took his word for it and wanted to make sure.) \n\nThis situation is currently at the point where B and J are toxic to T, I stand up for him, B, J and me argue with both of them ganging up on me, and B saying that I always start fights or ruin the mood (because our other friends are present when this happens). It also has come to the point were B mocks me, every time he's talking to T and talks shit to him (but not in the toxic way) he says \"sorry, sorry, I don't want to get into trouble\" (referring to me) or telling others to not curse at T or else they'll get in trouble too. I want to try and talk to B since he is my cousin, but I'm not sure how to go about it because if I just sit down and have a talk with him, I feel like he won't care, won't pay attention, and just brush it off. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for standing up for T and ruining the mood?\n\nP.S. Apologies if this got to long, I found that this was a good way to vent."

            "text": "I (25F) recently graduated college in Spring and was able to secure a paid internship close to home that could potentially lead to a full-time job.\n\nDuring college, even with financial aid, I had to take out some loans and jump around part-time jobs for extra dough. So I\u2019ve accumulated nearly 30K in debt, but I\u2019m paying off a big chunk of the monthly balance during the grace period with the income I earn from my internship and savings I\u2019ve collected from my part-time jobs. I do ask for some help from my Dad, but I\u2019m trying to take on more of that responsibility while also helping around the house with the grocery shopping and cooking.\n\nMy younger brother - let\u2019s call him Matthew (24M) - has been successful in his endeavors. He graduated college 2 years ago, nailed a job interview to work in a tech company, and paid off all his loans (he didn't need to take out a lot and also worked part-time jobs during college). He\u2019s done quite well for himself.\n\nI\u2019ve been back at home and bonding with my parents when they brought up that they\u2019d really appreciate my help to start contributing some more money to the rent, car insurance, etc. I had absolutely no problem with that until I asked if Matthew was also helping, which they said he wasn\u2019t.\n\nI was baffled and asked them why he didn\u2019t need to contribute despite the fact he was always available at home and obviously doing better than I was in terms of income. They told me that I was the older sibling and that I had to take on more responsibilities than him.\n\nI argued that it wasn\u2019t fair because Matthew had been living at home since graduating and had already secured a solid job while I was still fresh out of college trying to balance between loan repayment, the internship, and saving up more for my own future dreams. It didn\u2019t make any sense that he should get the luxury of keeping the entirety of his earnings while I had to sacrifice mine.\n\nNeedless to say the mood soured and now my parents think I\u2019m being selfish and a \u201cbad sibling role model.\u201d\n\nAITA?"

They have been friends since longgg before I was born, and my mom whole side of the family knows her and considers her and her husband as family. I\u2019ve known her my entire life, and she babysat me a good handful of times when I was younger. My grandma and I don\u2019t have the closest relationship at the moment, but it is certainly not bad. \nThe reason I don\u2019t want T at my wedding is because she is an alcoholic and an absolutely terrible drunk. The last time I was with her was when she, my mother, grandmother, my sister and I all went on a 9 hr road trip for a family members funeral out of state. She could not stay sober the entire trip. However, the problem is that when she is drunk, she is loud, rude, and is incapable of controlling herself. So I said I didn\u2019t want her at my wedding. \nMy grandma found out from my cousin that my other grandmas best friend was invited, and now shes pissed at me and throwing a fit. She\u2019s posting all over her Facebook that her family doesnt love her and she\u2019s going to k*ll herself. This is something she has done on several, less severe occasions. \nBut I\u2019m still not sure if I should feel bad, or invite T, so I need to know, AITA?"

            "text": "Throwaway just in case.\n\nI (20F) recently moved away from my house where my mom(49F), her boyfriend(34M), and her bf's daughter(10F) are living. We all moved 9 months ago together since my mom separated. \n\nThe first months were wonderful since her new boyfriend was covering for most expenses while she recovered financially. Though the last months I realized he and I slept until very late at night. I would lock my room and work on uni assignments until 1 AM and he would stay on his computer in the living room until 2 AM. This is where things get \"weird\". The new house is tiny, so we would all get cramped up in the kitchen quite often. I realized he would touch my lower back to move past me, and only when my mom wasn't around. This alarmed me and quickly told her, so it stopped. \n\nThough later at night while finishing work, I decided to go to our guest bathroom, which is directly placed in front of my bedroom. When you go out of my room, on the back you can clearly see the living room and almost in front we keep a large sofa. He was laying in it in pitch darkness very much obviously touching himself and stopped when he saw me. I noted this as an accident, went to the bathroom and back to work. My mom was asleep. \nProblem began when he started doing this every. single. night, sometimes making it very clear that he did not care whether I saw or not, at one point I made the mistake to glance and he was naked on the sofa. I was confused and disgustef and did not tell my mom until recently (though I told her it only happened three times). She confronted him and he denied everything, then my mom got angry at me for \"hiding it\" and told me to wake her up next time and \"ask for a pill\" as an excuse. We installed an extra lock on my room after that and I started sleeping early. \n\nWell, he stopped for a while, but one night after he and my mom returned from a trip, I found him on the sofa, lights out and clearly not working on his computer, like he told us. Inmediately I went up to wake her up, explained what was going on and she went to take a look, I went back to sleep. \nNext day I asked her whether he was doing something inappropiate or not. She lashed out on me saying that I was \"too intense, anxious and paranoic\" and \"nothing had happened\". I was baffled because I did exactly what she told me. This is where I may be AITA.\n\nI told her I would be leaving to grandma's house for a while. I've been here 3 weeks. Just today while out with my other relatives, she came by and asked me to come back. I refused and told her I felt  uncomfortable on that house. \n\nAITA for not returning? My mom is  distressed. We are the only ones that know what exactly happened, and I don't know whether I'm being petty or not. He's incredibly nice to her. \n\nExtra info, I currently have a full scholarship for uni that I have to work for to keep. Having a job is not allowed, but I still do extra work to cover my own expenses."

My friend who I met at church is going back to South Korea because of certain health issues and our church had a party for her since she is moving back to korea. I hadn't been attending church since the quarantine but all of a sudden everyone was urging her and my other church friends to invite me to my friends going away party. As it turns out the reason my church wanted to invite me so badly was to give me conversion therapy. Somehow, certain members of my church found out that I was gay even though I have not formally come out to members of my church. \n\nA couple hours into the party I was personally called out by a couple that attends our church and they told everyone I was gay. The couple then decided to give me an hour long lecture about sexuality and told me I must resist my homosexual urges and \"turn to the principles of god\" to which I got very emotional to. I started to feel like I was gonna cry so I left the party with my mom. \n\nI dont really know what I did wrong because I never brought up my sexuality in the first place but i will admit that I did cause a pretty big scene when leaving the party. I yelled at the couple and told them i was gonna find a new church and never show up to services again because of their behavior which I can see was uncalled for. I feel kind of bad that I ruined my friends party and my mom got a lot of messages saying that my behavior was uncalled for and that aita."

The last 1.5y have been horrible for him for obvious reasons.\n\nJust prior to the pandemic we became 50/50 partners in a cafeteria business targeting surrounding offices housing 2000+ people. We entered a 3y lease valued at ~$1M. When the pandemic came, we knew we were screwed. Almost all of our customers went WFH, so our plans were unattainable. We had to cancel and enter delinquency. The landlord hard-balled us, and demanded we paid. After round #1 of negotiations, they wanted $200k. I said \u2018no go\u2019, and offered $80k, take it or leave it. They reluctantly agreed.\n\nAround the same time, my friend was severely depressed due to impact corona had on on his biz. He told me he was going to sell his dream cottage which has been his family\u2019s safe harbor for all these years. I suggested Airbnb as a way to generate cash instead. \n\nFor transparency, there\u2019s a huge disparity between my friend\u2019s financial situation and mine. I own a successful business in a different industry, one that\u2019s actually thrived during the pandemic.\n\nI wanted to help. I promoted his food delivery business and bought 100s of food packs from him to generate $ for him and gave them away to my employees. Finally, I told my friend that I would pay up the whole $80k settlement myself.\n\nThen along came June, pandemic restrictions were lifted and great weather kicked in \u2014 the perfect time to be a restaurateur. My friend\u2019s business was thriving again and I was *so* happy for him. He went from depressed state to hyper, working 14h/d and making money, again.\n\nImagine my surprise when my friend told my wife he just bought a fancy new SUV. And not just any SUV, but the biggest one there is: a BMW X7 with a 4-digit list price. Not jealous of the car in the slightest (my car\u2019s list price was 2x): he should drive a Bentley if he can afford it.\n\nAround the time I settled, my friend asked my accountant if she (aka me) could pay *his* health insurance bills. Also he tried to take $40k worth of kitchen equipment that my team secured after the settlement (never paid a cent for any of it). My employee refused and told him he would need to ask me first, which pissed him off and he left. Oh, and he still owes me a few grand for 2019 skiing vacation. \n\nI can\u2019t help it: I feel that he took advantage of me for personal gain. I also think he went nuts for spending so much money on a new car right after a pandemic that nuked his business and his savings.\n\nSo, AITA for avoiding my friend and not wanting to spending time with him (particularly that we are now on vacation in the same hotel)? It was his b-day yesterday and giving in to pressure (he walked in to our hotel room &amp; invited us in front of kids), our families went to dinner at a nearby restaurant. I asked for 2 separate bills. Also, we didn\u2019t share a word during the entire dinner."

This story is about my grandma from my father's side, so I will just refer to her as grandma.\n\nWhen my husband and I first started dating, I was living between him and my mom, I would go back and forth. My grandma would pick me up from my mom's because she would take me to work sometimes. This meant if I was at my then-boyfriends place, I needed to go back to my mom's. When my grandma first saw my husband she HATED him. I brushed her off at first because it was still early into the relationship. I thought she would eventually just come around as she did for my previous relationships. Absolutely freakin not! She got worse just saying things like \"look at his long hair, like a girl\" \"he is bad man\" \"he's only going to you to abuse and use you, you watch\". \n\nThe hilarious part, to me, is she LOVED my last boyfriend who actually abused me! Not kidding. And she really did say awful things about him BECAUSE OF HIS HAIR. Sorry about putting it in all caps, but I still find it ridiculous after all these years. \n\nShe would not let this go though, and I tried to get her to at least meet him to show her she's wrong. But she wasn't having it. We ended up getting into a big fight over it where she basically said if I kept seeing him don't count on her being around. So I said fine be that way, still thinking she'll just get over it eventually. As far as I know, she never did. I think she thought I would run back to her and say sorry but I never did. I think this because the same year she called me for my birthday crying saying she misses me but didn't apologize, hung up and never called again.\n\nNow after all these years, I feel like I should at least try to have a relationship with her as I am her only grandchild. My great grandma (mom's side) is also pressuring me to do this. My husband is saying to do what I want. The thing is I worry my grandma believes she didn't say anything wrong, even though I think our marriage proves that quite literally. She's a stubborn woman, but I really think I won't be able to forgive her and move on if she doesn't apologize to him or me or at the very least not have awful things to say about him. \n\nSo WIBTAH asking for this apology if I get in contact with her again? \n\nP.S. Sorry if it's long."

We harass one another, whack each other with rags, criticize each other\u2019s work skills/ethics and driving, and basically how you expect.\n\nAbove are things my coworkers have done to this one coworker, too; I\u2019ll call him Tim (late 40\u2019s). We make fun of his driving skills, engage in verbal altercations for fun, and whack him with rags. Tim, like the rest of us, knows it\u2019s all in good fun and reciprocates.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with Tim for 5 months at this point. I poked fun at him, and he made jabs at me. However, one morning, Tim had to pick me up in our shuttle after I delivered a car. While driving, he narrowly missed the median in the road and I jokingly said, \u201cwow, you really can\u2019t drive.\u201d That snapped something in him and he started screaming. I can\u2019t recall exactly what he said (it happened a few months ago), but I do remember some things. He accused me of being on drugs (\u201cAre you on fxcking drugs right now? Are you? What are you on?\u201d) and threatened to turn me into our supervisor to get me tested (because I was in the ER the previous night. No, I was not on any nor was given any). He CONTINUOUSLY asked if the hospital gave me something because I was \u201cacting like such a b1tch\u201d. Then went on to say he missed how nice I was when I first started since all I am is a b1tch now.\n\nI had no idea how to respond, I didn\u2019t think he was serious. He\u2019s known for being relatively nice. He was always the calmer one, yet here he was screaming at me for a simple comment. This took me by surprise. I didn\u2019t expect a grown adult to revert to screaming at a college student for something we all do to one another instead of talking it out. Had he come to me, I\u2019d\u2019ve stopped any of my harassment. After that, I distanced myself. I didn\u2019t want someone so two-faced in my life and close to me. I wouldn\u2019t text him, nor would I partner up with him. I avoided him. He texted a few weeks later saying sorry if he made me mad. I kept replaying it and wondered if it actually happened because he acted fine then after the ride and acts fine now. Another coworker, who I told, mentioned that \u201cmaybe he was just joking\u201d, and honestly? If he was joking, it would be that much worse, especially with the drug accusation in an automotive business. This happened months ago, but I keep thinking about it. I wondered if I\u2019m actually mean. I\u2019ve asked a supervisor and coworkers that I harass if they think I am and they told me no, clearly confused. I double-checked asking if I ever push my limits with what I say/do to them and they tell me no, they would\u2019ve said something.\n\nAITA for ignoring him with no want to remotely try to make things right again? I feel like we all have bad days and I may be overreacting, therefore I may be TA for letting my behaviour to him continue when it could\u2019ve just been an off day."

The store has been short staffed the entire summer and has had to cut its hours almost in half to stay open. I\u2019ve worked at this store on and off for five years while I finished high school and put myself through college. Both of my brothers also work at the store, and my parents figured it would be easy for  us to work at the same place, since we only have one reliable car between the three of us. I always planned to quit at some point, ideally once I had another job that was more in line with my degree lined up.\n\nLast week, however, was truly truly horrid. I came home crying after every shift and had to work through a power outage (described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/oqc26w/i_had_a_breakdown_in_front_of_customers_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). My stress levels were through the roof and I finally decided I\u2019d had enough and that I was going to quit. My parents were extremely supportive of my decision and my mother even offered to drive me to the store so I could talk to the store manager. I told her that I didn\u2019t think I could handle going back to the store and that I was planning to call the manager instead. She kinda flipped out on me a bit and said that it wasn\u2019t professional and I was ruining my chances of getting a good reference for future jobs. We argued about it for a while before she finally gave up and left me alone. I get where she was coming from, but my anxiety literally could not handle going back to the store after the week I had. So I called the manager and left him a voicemail (he either wasn\u2019t in that day or wasn\u2019t at his desk at the time) explaining my reasons for quitting. I immediately felt a weight lift off my shoulders.\n\nThe next night, my brothers came home from work and told me how upset the manager was that I quit without a two week notice. He apparently understood my reasons but thought that I should have been able to \u2018tough it out\u2019 until they could hire more people (only one person submitted an application the entire summer, so the chances of them hiring someone to replace me were very low).\n\nTo sum up:\n- My mom is angry that I quit over the phone because she thinks it was unprofessional.\n- My former boss is mad at me for quitting without giving a two week notice because the store is short staffed and he wanted time to find a replacement, despite almost no one applying to work at the store the entire summer.\nAm I the asshole in either of these situations?"

I make the least out of the household and the rest of her immediate family, so it makes sense for me to be the one to drop everything (I'm missing out on the least), but this was her own fault, and I'm sick of everything falling on me. Plus I just can't afford to miss more time, especially not for other people. \n\nDetails: My grandma's house flooded for the fifth time this year (she can't get it fixed and she refuses to move). We were finally back home from helping soak up the water and trying to dry off things that we just replaced two weeks ago from the last flood, and then her power goes out. My grandma, 85 years old, can hardly walk even with a walker, can't see great because she's due for her cataracts surgery, decides to get her big lymphedemic self onto a ladder my dad had left out for tomorrow, to reach the fuse box by herself. Of course she fell, and she had no business being up there. This isn't a life or death situation, she probably just broke her arm, and people go days with untreated broken bones all the time (I've done it). I literally cannot afford to take more time off work, and I've already used two of my seven \"points\" at work for unexcused absences because of her, and our points just reset in April, so it's quite a bit. \n\nEveryone is treating me like I'm a POS, but my grandma has 4 of her kids still alive. My two uncles and their spouses are God knows where, my aunt only cares if she thinks someone is going to die so she can snatch up an inheritance, my mom has no more vacation days, and my dad is in the same situation as me where we don't get paid time off but we get in trouble for calling off with no note. I always handle it because everyone else would be losing more money than me by missing work, but I can't do it much longer. Are they right to be upset with me for putting my job and security over her self-inflicted pain, or is it time for someone else to do something for once? I really would go over there right away if it was a true accident, but her being dumb and getting into trouble is always an issue regardless of her age, so I don't even feel bad anymore because she knowingly puts such a burden on the few people who have stuck around over the years of her being insufferable."

            "text": "The title is not a good look but let me explain. My mom was in an abusive marriage with my dad (him being the abusive one). They lived together for around 16 years and he ended up physically threatening her life which was the last straw. \n\nIt\u2019s been 5 years since their separation now. As usual, no child support but he still pops up here and there to give me and my brother gifts. I don\u2019t like him, but my brother does so I stick around. The main reason I talk to him though is because I want some sort of closure- I don\u2019t know what I want. I\u2019m still figuring it out. I\u2019m 17.\n\nI have a feeling these regular sightings bring up some form of trauma for my mom.because it gets more intense whenever she sees him.\n\nFast forward to today. My mom came into my room with red eyes from crying at 7am in the morning. She came for comfort and I listened and empathised. I waited for her to get tired from talking like she usually does but nope, she kept going on and on. \n\nThen she started on a topic that I really really really hate. It was another story on when my dad said something so hurtful she still remembers it almost 20 years later. It always messes with me -instant tears.\n\n My usual docile self would sit there and let her make me cry and share her sorrow. But I had enough, I yelled at her that she does this every single day and I\u2019m fucking tired.I told her I know she\u2019s hurting but now she\u2019s involving my younger brother, doing to him what she did to me . I told her it\u2019s not fair to make your kids grieve over something they had no control over . I mention therapy but she always ignores me. \n\nAfterwards I apologised for being so loud and she whispers \u201cit\u2019s ok, my heart feels shattered now\u201d\n\n\nNow before you pass your judgment, here\u2019s my side of things:\n\nI have been my moms therapist since I was 8.This means whenever my dad hit her- she\u2019d come to me and cry. She\u2019d talk about abusive things he did in all situations (even\u2026bedroom stuff) keep in mind- I was ,and still technically am, a child. \n\nI used to cry for her so much. It broke my heart to see her cry and go through so much abuse just \u201cfor the kids\u201d. For ME. She went through it for ME . It still destroys me when I think about it.\n\nI can\u2019t even count the nights I spend crying over what she had been through. It\u2019s always taken a big toll on me, I started making my own judgements, despising men . Hating my dad- I mean can you imagine loving your moms abuser?\n\nI can\u2019t even have a normal conversation with her now. It always ends up with her talking about my dad and how he got away with everything he did to her. Every single day. \n\nYou don\u2019t understand how guilty this makes me feel. I admit I shouldn\u2019t have exploded at her but I\u2019ve tried talking calmly but it doesn\u2019t work. She just ignores me and keeps talking.\n\nI certainly feel like the A-hole. AITA?"

She mocks my tics, and she even flirts with people I get crushes on after I tell her about them. I was asked to make a group chat with her and 2 other friends, \"Josh\" (16m) and \"Leon\" (16m). They mostly talk about stuff I'm not allowed to know about (anime, certain friends, etc). If I ever try and change the subject, they just say I'm being rude and basically ignore me the rest of the day. Eventually, I just stopped talking and they all thought I left it. They started talking bad about me. \"She's always sleeping, she's to unpredictable with her energy (I'm getting tested for ADHD, they know this)\". I tell them all the f off, and they play innocent. \"We didn't do anything wrong\". I replied to them mocking me and ask them to prove me wrong. I just left the chat, crying and hurt. Now all my \"friends\" (the ones Jean pretty much converted) are saying ITA because I was over reacting. \"It was just harmless teasing, you didn't have to make such a big deal over it.\" My stepbrother says I'm justified, and welcome to hang with his friends.

            "text": "My partner has been a chef for 15+ years. We have been together for 3 years. When we first met, my partner was working 3 jobs and doing crazy hours. \n\nHe ended up getting fired from his main job, so he called his old boss/mentor, and succesfully won the sous chef position at his previous place of work. This is where he did his apprenticeship, from the stories he has told me, it was a toxic workplace and he experienced some serious abuse and indoctrination into the hospitality industry. I was wary of him returning to this place, I felt like it would bring up old feelings and bad memories. He assured me that wouldn't happen, and this was a good opportunity with less hours, more money and stability. So we agreed, and I was excited to be able to spend quality time with him. This was 2 years ago. \n\nSince then, there hasnt been a moment of peace at the job. There are some fucked up politics, management only cares about making money. When covid hit, they didnt support their staff at all, and put them on unpaid leave. Things are opening up again, so his work have started booking events, and will up the numbers without consulting the kitchen, or making sure there are enough ingredients to accommodate the extra numbers. This is just a few examples, but theres a lot more going on. \n\nSince working there, I can see that it stresses my partner out. He comes home in a shit mood, doesnt want to engage etc. He's gotten into cycling as a stress relief, and I'm happy that he has found something, but it doesnt seem to be enough. I feel like I'm constantly walking on egg shells, I dont feel supported, our sex life has gone down, he gets snappy, he sits outside, working on his bike for hours. I've picked up the slack around the house, thinking it will be temporary, but it doesnt seem to be ending anytime soon. I have my own mental health issues, I take medication &amp; go to therapy, and it's becoming exhausting living in a house with 2 people, but only having 1 person contribute. \n\nI've encouraged him to go to therapy or see a doctor about his mental health, but he's not interested. I told him that he should maybe look for another job, but he feels like he needs to show loyalty to his old boss. Even though, his boss doesnt display the same behaviour. He deflects the conversation, and shuts down whenever I bring it up. \n\nIts gotten to the point where I've told him I no longer want to hear about what's going on at work. I find it extremely draining talking about it, especially when he doesn't want to make any changes, and just wants to talk shit about his colleagues. So, unless he is wanting to discuss strategies, I dont want to know. He got upset and said I'm not being supportive, and we ended up having a huge fight, because I brought up the fact that I am legitimately doing EVERYTHING in the house. We arent talking right now. Am I the Asshole?"

Says he doesn't see his kids and its not my responsibility and he'll sell his car for money if he has to.\n\nI love him and I love his kids, but the reality of the situation is that I can literally not feed them too right now. I knows its just two kids and a few extra meals, but its the reality of our situation and one of the kids is a preteen that eats more than I do some days and thats ok.

He also was diagnosed with mental illness when he was kicked out of the military for rage issues but refuses to seek help because he's not \"crazy.\"\n\n5 years ago he started testing boundaries. He'd claim to want understand my beliefs. Attempting to do only ever led to him shouting and calling me names.  \n\nMy uncle is of the same political persuasion as me, but I have only met him once. I've never spoken to him besides that visit and when my dad had surgery which my uncle, a Vietnam vet with PTSD, wanted to come to but was kicked off the flight due to a flare. My uncle was so ashamed and sought help.\n\nMy dad and uncle have been having public social media fights over politics. I messaged my dad to point out he was not required to reply to or even see what my uncle posted and vice versa. He agreed but didn't stop. \n\nRecently one of my uncle's friends died and my uncle flew to the funeral. My uncle posted about it and my dad replied to the man's obituary with all sorts of nasty things about how my uncle clearly only couldn't fly to my dad's surgery because of politics.Then proceeded to challenge my uncle to a \"public political debate\" to prove my uncle is an idiot. He literally spammed him the entire day he was at the funeral.\n\nI snapped. I replied and mentioned our history and recommended both of them step away from the discussion entirely. \n\nPer my father I should have kept this private instead of spreading lied. I said not a single word I said was a lie and I believed he needed to seek anger management therapy. He blocked me on social media. He didn't block my husband and he saw my father saying I was a liar and pretending he hadn't blocked me and I was just too afraid to reply to his \"truth.\"  So I posted my side of the story to my timeline with details.\n\nThat night he starts texting me. Calling me names and again reiterating the public betrayal. I replied he needed to cool down and I would discuss it in two days.\n\nI received an email the next day that I din't open. Then my uncle messaged me saying my dad was making threats to publicly shame my mom (divorced from my dad when I was 6) if I didn't immediately admit I was a liar.\n\nI got the okay from mom before replying to him that that was not a rational way to react and begging him to seek counseling and not contact me again until he had.\n\nHe sent all the lurid details of my mom's sex life before I was born, as well as fabricated claims about me to all of my social media friends. My friends luckily all either blocked him, or had some rather spectacular fights with him. \n\nObviously, the last part of how he reacted is unacceptable.

My friends often say they would like to spend more time with my child, they want to have a good relationship, be present in their life and have an Aunty role in my child life. These are my best friends so obviously I want that too. They haven't been able to spend much time with my child recently because of the pandemic. \n\nSo this has happened a few times pre pandemic where they would say they want to hang out and spend time with me and my child. So I organise something and invite them along, and I always try and do something that they will enjoy as well as my child e.g. a restaurant with a play area attached. However, when we get there they only want to talk to each other and have 'grown up conversation' e.g. talking only about themselves and not engaging with my child at all. This is quite awkward as it leaves me playing / talking to my child and them having a separate conversation the whole time. So I don't get to talk to my friends and my child doesn't interact with them either.\n\nIt was a bit annoying and awkward but I didn't say anything as I figured maybe they just weren't used to being around babies and didn't know how to engage? \n\n\nNow that COVID restrictions have been lifted they again suggested spending a day with my child. Theyre also a toddler now so able to do more stuff so we planned a day out at a local attraction that kids and adults can enjoy. \n\nWell we got there and it's more of the same, they're just talking to each other, not really speaking to me or my child. They keep walking ahead, not accounting for the fact I have to wrangle a toddler into going the right way and carry a few bags with all our stuff. They never offered any help just either walked of or watched me struggle looking bored. \n\nThey also got bored and wanted to go to the attractions designed for adults which my child would be too little for. It just really felt like we were an inconvenience to their day. \n\nI'm feeling like from now on I might just keep my friendships and my child separate as they don't seem to mesh very well but idk if IATA to be annoyed as I know some people just aren't kid people?"

My husband and I decided to have them to our place for a meal. I (29F) knew from speaking with Lisa that Hannah had some sensory issues and was a picky eater, so I talked to her about what I was planning to serve beforehand and verified it was stuff Hannah would eat. We decided to grill some chicken breasts and have them with salad and rolls and let the kids make their own sundaes for dessert. \n\nWhen they came over, the kids had a great time running around and playing with our lab mix, Bo (2NM), and were generally well-behaved and pleasant. When we sat down, I noticed Hannah wasn\u2019t eating any of her chicken. I asked if it was okay because sometimes my husband undercooks chicken on the grill. She nodded politely, but Clare said that Hannah didn\u2019t like white meat because it had a dry texture. \n\nI felt bad and didn\u2019t want Hannah to be hungry, so I offered to make her a PB&amp;J. Clare said that would be great, but Nick spoke up and said \u201cno, don\u2019t make her anything special.\u201c I said it was no trouble, but he pretty firmly said \u201cno, she needs to learn to eat what she is given.\u201d Clare looked upset but didn\u2019t say anything else. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just sat back down and we continued to eat. \n\nAfter everyone left, Lisa explained that Nick didn\u2019t think Hannah really had any sensory issues and thought she was just spoiled. I asked her if I had handled it okay and she said that she thought I should have insisted on making Hannah a sandwich because I knew she had sensory issues and it would have been the polite thing to do. I could have done that, but I felt uncomfortable overruling someone else\u2018s parenting choices. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if Lisa was right.

They have a 1.5 year old and a baby die next month and now I feel like I\u2019ve broken up their family. \n\nAITA for messaging my brother to tell him this girl messaged me?"

They allowed me to transfer back and forth between cities for uni and I appreciated this but after covid when I was taken off of furlough I wasn't given shifts, this was a breach of my contract which still hasn't been resolved. \n\nI transfer back to my former store for the summer and realise they are massively struggling for staff in certain departments, around this point I hear that roughly 5 people have handed their notice in, I also happened to get another job and handed mine in and was planning on moving back to uni to start soon. This was when my manager mentioned that my notice period would require me to travel back to the store to work 1 day, that's 5 hours on the train for 1 day of minimum wage retail work so I just ignored his messages and never have to go back there now.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for putting them in that position?"

Also i'm not english, so sorry for any mistakes\n\nPeople/info\n\n-Me,23F and BF of 3 yrs,23M, both in uni.\n\nBF's sisters:\n\n-Naly,37F\nGetting her 2nd degree to better her position after working as a detective for 10 yrs, hard worker\n\n- Vera,34F\nShe's the \"take in pills, don't mix with alcohol\" type\nImmature, a bit spoiled and selfish (in a childish, not entitled way). Wants attention.\nBut also very caring and joyful (even if easily stressed by trivial stuff). Considered me family from the start\n\nThe 3 siblings love each other a lot, we all think the same about Vera but always treat her with love and respect, calming things down whes she looks for fights and keeping her in check at events (where she tends to get smashed and loud)\n\nAlso, Naly and I are pretty similar, and in these 3 years we became friends and spoke about why this degree is important to her\n\nSo, onto the dilemma\n\nBF, Vera and I were casually chatting about the grad party when Vera started one of her organization whimps (=give expensive inputs, change her mind every day then argue).\n\nThen she read the speech she wrote the day before and wanted to give at the party: see, here speeches are made at almost every party, people even hire professionals to help with wording and even frame them\n\nVera doesnt like books and reads mechanichaly in a \"tight\", childly voice. Nothing wrong with that, just to give the picture. The speech was pretty brief and had the most common, diabetic things SHE likes (at parties Naly and I joke about them, they all sound the same and, at one point, almost sarcastic lol. We also prefer jokes over joy tears)\n\nAs i said, no problem with that, the message is love and we're not critics. Also, the family is really sweet and genuine, so nobody would think \"eew NoT wRitTeN pRopErLy\".\n\nBut, i often write down things i find cool or useful. I also love to read and was a bit in theatre, teachers usually tell me i'm good at writing/exposing\n\nSometimes, i joked with BF about things that could be said in her party and wrote that down. Sometimes to destress i organized those notes (among with many others)\n\nBF brought it up with Vera, i tried to downplay it, not wanting to seem competitive, but Vera pushed so i read it. It was just fine, natural and simple but also personal and a bit emotional. I also wanted to ask the family to approve it and they can read it (its not from my own point of view) as i dont want the spot, just to make Naly happy.\n\nVera was obviously hurt, and if we made both speeches nobody would think less of hers but she wouldnt feel the protagonist for her big sis' speech\n\nI proposed she takes the parts she likes, but she fakely told \"its fine, you read it\"\n\nBut i also dont want to avoid saying that to Naly in that important moment (she kind of needs it as she thinks she dont deserve a party at 37) just bc i fear Vera will be drunk/loud to have the attention she wants\n\nWIBTA if i proposed my speech?"

Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.   \n\nI call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.  \n\nI ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to \"take a mental health day and do some self-care\". I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: \"I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that.\".  \n\nFrankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.  \n\nSo I told her that she had two choices:  \n\n1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.  \n\n2) I fire her completely.  \n\nShe's calling me all sorts of \"-ist\" now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender. \n\nNone of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business. \n\nI think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.  \n\nBut at the same time, she really could have called me.  \n\n\nSo, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole?"

She was supposed to come in December but her flights kept getting cancelled because of covid. I took a career job in April and had to relocate for the job to a town a few hours. \n\nFast forward a few months and now she was finally able to get a flight. I had recommended to her to stay near the city somewhere as she'll have a better opportunity for jobs and she'd be closer to her school campus (her plan was to do courses online and move in winter if she had to). She still wanted to live with me which I was fine with, I was excited and told her that I have everything she will need (utensils, cooking tools etc) and told her to bring only her clothes and other necessities. I had to negotiate with my landlord to hold off on finding a new tenant to be my housemate, this went on for several months as her flights started getting cancelled over and over again. She also wanted me to contact her school and get her registered, and asked if I can keep a tab on her emails. \n\nShe was finally able to get a flight this weekend and we don't think its getting cancelled. This is where things took a turn though. My mother wanted to send me a small care package (about a kg) of stuff. It is common courtesy to take something for someone when travelling internationally, I've had to carry random things for random relatives (nothing illegal) when I travel abroad and back. It was all small things my mom was sending (few packets of spices, my glasses in a case, a small ring and some over-the-counter medicine I can't find here).\n\nWell, my friend texted me today, saying she could only bring half of my stuff because her bags are full. I asked her why she couldn't bring everything, as it was a small amount and I knew she wasn't carrying anything other than mostly clothes. She responded with \"so?\". \n\nIt really rubbed me the wrong way. I didn't really care about the stuff anymore but was really disappointed in my friend. I got mad at her because she couldn't sacrifice an outfit or two for me, even though I've been dealing with so much for her. She ended up crying and telling her mom we got into a fight because she couldn't bring her stuff. Her mom has been sending me non stop voice messages being agro and asking me if she can trust me with her daughter. \n\nThey think that I'm a bad friend because I valued the stuff over my friend. I tried to explain that I'm mad because she wasn't able to sacrifice a little bit of space for me, after all I am doing for her. She is able to bring 54kg of luggage with her and I was disappointed she couldn't even spare 1kg of that space for me.\n\nI know a good friend shouldn't expect anything in return. I feel guilty a little for fighting over things but I feel disappointed and angry my friend couldn't even do this much for me. \n\nAITA?"

However, in retaliation she sends out general staff messages berating me about things that are either personal or things that\u2019s she thinks I\u2019m doing wrong because it\u2019s different to how she does it.\n\nI have told her that a few members of staff have already complained about working with her as she snaps about every tiny mistake and it makes them feel like shit.

            "text": "I 17F traveled to a town for the summer to visit family and have a good time! I just graduated. I don't have a job. \n\nMy cousin just turned 10. For her birthday I  took her to sephora and got her 'grown up' makeup and a nice set of skincare products. On the way back from Sephora I took her to the corner store to get her a snacks and a drink.\n\nBy the till there is a box filled with pipes, bongs, ashtrays and cig stompers. (Idk what it's called up you put of cigarettes with it) One is shaped like a crown. She begged for it, she had been begging and asking for everything! Most of which I let her have. I said no to the cigarette paraphernalia, because I'm 17 and it would look pretty bad to get her cigarette things. Plus that stuff is over priced as hell. She sulked about it. She told me she just wanted to put it on her cat because it would look cute. I still didn't want to buy it.\n\nIve been staying with my (32F) auntie and cousin for about a week. A few days ago my cousin brought up the crown. I told her I might be able to ask it, but made no promises. I think you need to be 19 to get that kind of stuff.\n\nYesterday I asked her if she wanted to go to grandma's house and ask about the crown. She said yes, and I took her to the gas station to get a drink and snacks before we went to the town. The walk went well, we had a lot of fun and once we got into town I asked her if she still wanted to go to the corner store. She said no, she wanted to go to grandma's house. So we went to grandma's house. She forgot all about going to the corner store. Then that's when she realized she lost her iPad along the trail.\n\nWe went up and down with vehicles and walked up and down some parts. I took her to the store again, and got her more drinks and snacks to make her feel better. But I was (and am) running out of money. At this point I've spent about 150$ on her.\n\nWe drove to grandma's house today. My cousin has been really grouchy. Aside from our walk and when people spend money on her. we were all sitting around the table. My cousin must have remembered the crown and told me I owed her. That I was rude and it wasn't fair that I didnt buy her the crown. She told me we had to go to the corner store and buy it.\n\nI told her I didnt have much money because I spent most of it on her yesterday and the days before. I still have about a week left in town before I go back home. She threw a tantrum. It was super awkward. Then she gave everyone the silent treatment.\n\nI talked to my auntie and grandma later who essentially said she is being moody/ungrateful. Heres the thing too, my cousin lost most of the makeup, and other things she begged me to buy her, she didnt eat half the food she asked for. I doubt she would use a tiny crown. It would most likley be forgotten in a day or two.\n\nSkip to tonight,  she still hasn't forgiven me. She is and angry. I can't tell if I'm being too stingy or if she is being unreasonable. \n\nAm I the asshole?"

            "text": " \n\nMy mother has this friend Michelle (41) who has two daughters Meg (12) and Hazel (4). My mum and I have been helping Michelle and the kids after the divorce about a year and a half ago. In the beginning I used to watch the kids while my mum and Michelle went out shopping, had girl time, ect. But I have never met a worst behaved 4 yr old in my life! Hazel has no manners and screams about everything constantly. And I have three little cousins under the age of 8 whom I also babysit.\n\nI quickly stopped babysitting much to the anger of my mother. Now my mother, who can't say no to save her life, is being forced to raise Michelle's kids. I didn't really care till my mother started calling them my sisters. I told her \u201cNo, I'm still an only child.\u201d that didn\u2019t go well...\n\nAnyhow about three weeks ago I was out with my mother Michelle and the two girls and she said how much she loved helping raise Hazel and she feels I was a failure and the Career I plan to go into is a joke. Michelle then goes on how she feels the same and she thinks she failed with Megan. Did I mention she said this all in front of me?\n\nSo I let her know how I felt she was absent as my mother and she was cruel to call me a failure. She then played the victim card and said that I was a difficult child to raise and I was wasting her hard work with my career path. Then cried for a bit and told me I was just like my father and I would die with nothing like my father.\n\nMy father is a bright man who got into oil at 17 and made millions. And the nothing she is referring to? Is that he is not married and that I am his only child. Sadly at the moment he is succumbing to a genetic disease that has been making him weak and sick for the last three yrs.\n\nAfter this my mother went crying and telling all my extended family That Im mentaly abusing her and manipulating her into everything I want. Now everyone Is messaging and calling to say i'm an asshole and she tried her best and i should apologize. So I just want to know, am I an asshole? Should I apologize?\n\nEdit- My fathers work did not give him a lot of time to be there. He was running his company most of the time, And when we did have time together my mother would not let him go anywhere with me without her. And frankly my father has always had a weak spot for my mother."

            "text": "So my (25F) sister (28F) will marry next month (we are all vaccinated). I am very excited, she and I picked dresses together and even though we don't get along all the time, like siblings do, we always make up in the end.\n\nNow my mother any I spoke last week and she asked me if my sister told me the seating arrangements for the wedding. I was suprised, because I spoke with my sister like the day before and she didn't mention anything. So my mum told me that I and my SO will be sitting with my step siblings and my cousins.\n\nTHE PROBLEMS\n\nMy \"step siblings\" are the kids of my dads new wife. I get along with his wife VERY well, but I only see her kids like 3 times a year and so we don't really have a lot to say to each other. My dad also married his new wife like two years ago, so we don't have any sibling relationship. We also had a few encounters, that did not go very well.\n\nMy 3 cousins are my aunts kids, from my mothers side. When my grandmother died over 15 years ago they disowned my mum and cut all contact with us. We couldn't even go to my grans funeral. They started to spread sh*t about my mother and I hated the whole family ever since. I didn't want to have anything to do with them. Well around 4 years ago my mum told me my cousins wanted to have contact with her again and if I wanted to meet them, too. I didn't and I told her, but she pressured me to do so, because she was so happy they wanted to meet her and us. As far as I am concerned they are not family to me. So now every easter I play a sharade by being polite and nice to them and it makes me physically sick every time. \n\nSo now I will sit at a table with all of them. As far as I am concerned they all are not really family to me. When my mum told me the seating arrangements I said \"well, sounds like we will sit at the side table then\", because I feel like we have been pushed away to the side, like you do with kids at christmas or another event, so they will be quiet and not bother the other adults. My mum scolded me for saying that, because it was rude, but I don't see it that way. It is like seating me with complete strangers.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER:\nI will NOT tell my sister any of this. I will NOT complain and ask her to be seated somewhere else. I KNOW that no one cares about the given seats after dinner is done, so I will definatelly not sit there for the whole evening. But I still think that she knew how I would feel. \n\nSo AITA for saying that my SO and I will be sitting at the side table at my sisters wedding?"

            "text": "Growing up, my parents had been very controlling, demeaning, &amp; critical in hopes of raising a 'perfect' child. As an adult now (30's), I realized that they used many narcisstic parenting techniques to lower my self-esteem &amp; listen to them. I confronted them about their behavior. They mentioned that they didn't know what they did had the negative effects on me so I took them at their word (maybe naively who knows) &amp; helped them be better parents. We read a great parenting book together &amp; they stated that they'd change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, after reading the book, their old behavior just came back &amp; I honestly didn't see much change. The other week, my mom mentioned that she had anxiety &amp; wondered how I managed through all the stressed in my life. I told her that meditation really helped me so she gave it a try. I texted her an app I liked to use that might help her with her meditation practice. The next night, my parents call me stating that my mom couldn't fall asleep last night bc she tried meditating &amp; got more anxiety. My mom was delirious &amp; said she thought she was going crazy focusing on her thoughts. I felt like they were blaming me for suggesting meditation to them. When I mentioned this, they mentioned that wasn't the case but in the future, I shouldn't mention meditation any more to my mom. I was like \"alright, meditation can be different for different people.\" I listened to what my mom was actually doing when meditating &amp; it sounded more like rumination than meditation, so I mentioned that to her, but my dad was pretty adamant on just forgetting about meditation. I let it drop but mentioned that the call that they gave me was quite unnecessarily dramatic - my mom just couldn't fall asleep for one night &amp; it necessitated a panicked call to their son stating that meditation was causing her to go crazy. She did fall asleep well after telling me this though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the call, my parents texted me not to worry &amp; that everything was ok. The entire interaction left a nasty feeling. Based on their past behavior, I feel like this is another form (conscious or unconscious) of manipulation, to essentially cause drama &amp; mental stress on their kid in order to gain control. In my opinion, if someone gives me a recommendation, but it doesn't work for me, there is absolutely no reason to call that person up at 11pm at night stating that that it's causing them to go crazy &amp; implicitly blame that person (even though they overtly said they weren't blaming me). They are in their 50s, so I honestly expect more emotional stability from them - not falling asleep for 1 night isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, I've distanced myself from my parents more &amp; stopped calling them regularly bc I don't feel comfortable helping them with anything (in case one of my recommendations doesn't help them &amp; then getting blamed for it). I am honestly tired of giving them more chances to be better adults. Am I the asshole?"

When we met I was depressed and he pretty much helped me throughout the process, he was my biggest fan and would always encouraged me to be my best version. He even encouraged me to apply for a better job without knowing that job meant I had to move to another city. We broke up because of this but continued communicating since we really cared for one another. 4 years passed by, I\u2019ve had a couple of boyfriends, he found the one and married her and we kept on texting or calling each other every now and then. Some days ago I buttcalled him while I was eating something and didn\u2019t realized until he texted me saying he was in trouble with his wife because she saw my call and my picture on his phone as it was ringing.\nI had no idea what the big issue was, it wasn\u2019t a call in the middle of the night or something inappropriate just a call made by mistake. Well, turns out she loathes me, she knows we have history and she just cannot stand me! I didn\u2019t know that, I guess I failed by not asking him but to me it was kinda weird to ask him: hey! Does your girlfriend/fianc\u00e9/wife know about me? \nI mean, we don\u2019t talk every single day, we can go for weeks without communication, sometimes all we do is send a meme and reply with another meme, no words. There is no flirtation or sexual content in anything we say. We usually just vent about work or life. So I didn\u2019t get why the hate. I honestly ask him if he is not allowed to talk to me, he can just block me and it\u2019s ok, I get it. He told me that wasn\u2019t the case and he had no intention in cutting me out of his life like that, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right to keep on talking when his wife is not ok with us communicating."

A friend of mine said she really likes my hair and asked what I was going to do with the hair after I cut it. I was a bit confused and told her that I would be throwing it away. She asked me to donate the hair instead because one of her friends had recently gone bald due to an illness and she had the exact same hair as me. She said that there's a company which would make a wig out of my hair for her. I told her I'd think about it. I did think about it but the thought of my hair on another person's head just makes me feel extremely squeamish and it's not something I'm really comfortable with. I told her that I was sorry but I didn't really want my hair to be used for a wig. She said I was being an Asshole because I was going to cut it anyways and I could donate it without any loss. I told her that I'd found a wig with the same color as my hair and she could just buy that for her friend. She said it was too expensive and I could just be a good person and donate it instead. I said that wasn't something I was comfortable with especially because I know the person she's talking about and meeting someone with my hair on their head gives me a ghastly feeling.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here but Reddit, AITA?"

The main attraction is the gorgeous lake - why we are here. We decided to go to a restaurant in an even smaller town with a super beautiful view of the lake\n\nWhen going to the restaurant we knew parking could be annoying, but we luckily found a park as soon as we drove up. Or so we thought\u2026\n\nAs we began to pull into the park, a woman (50s??) RAN ACROSS OUR CAR and blocked us with our bodies saying \u2018sorry taken!!!\u2019 (The parking is a normal village parking along the street, not paid parking or a parking centre).\n\nWe had our car already angled into the park, essentially blocking anyone from entering. We wound down our windows and said \u2018you can\u2019t block the park with your body? We are \u00e0 car?\u2019 And the woman and her husband and her trio of people in the car blasted abuse at us !!!! Saying we were stupid, big idiots.\n\nThey said they had been circling waiting for the park so it was theirs by right. I think it\u2019s just unfortunate circumstances, wrong place wrong time. My boyfriend agrees and we were quite shocked with how mad they were \u2026 I\u2019m just not sure if this is some kind of cultural thing I\u2019m missing???? Or are people just mean and crazy ??? We checked the law after and it backs us up \u2026 2 years in prision and 4500\u20ac)\n\nSo AITA?

But what made it worse was that he replied \u201cit\u2019s not racist.\u201d Followed up with a picture of a news article showing the Chinese dog meat festival and then further replies with \u201cthey do this in Mexico too, I\u2019m Hispanic BTW.\u201d \n\nAnd this honestly offended me immensely because I\u2019m Chinese myself and I absolutely do not tolerate any type of racism directed at me or anyone else for that matter and \u201cjokes\u201d don\u2019t make anything ok because, jokes and harassment, specifically towards Asians especially has been so normalized and accepted to the point where nobody really cares. \n\nAnd a lot of the time Asians aren\u2019t even seen as POC or as a marginalized group when we very much are.\n\nSo anyways fast forward and this guy sends me a long text \u201capologizing\u201d but still low key kind of defending himself, and apologizes to me in person. \n\nNow mind you this man is 25 years old, he\u2019s a kid and he\u2019s not a young dumb teenager either, he\u2019s an adult. I\u2019ve met children who know better than he does when it comes to things like this but mind you there are tons of ignorant adults but still\u2026 come on.\n\nI told him I appreciate the apology but it\u2019s not really accepted and I also said that I will be civil with him but never friends. \n\nHe replied saying that he wanted to be great friends here and outside of work which is nice but personally as of right now I don\u2019t want that. And at the end of things o told him the best thing that he could do for me now is to stay away from me. And I\u2019m return he said ok but he\u2019ll still be nice to me and he\u2019s said a few things to me lately but so far I\u2019ve ignored him and shrugged him off. \n\nWhat bothered me the most though is that he genuinely was trying to be funny with that comment and for me that\u2019s a big red flag because if casual racism Is in  his sense of humor, what else does he think is funny, what else does he \u201cjoke\u201d about, you know? \n\nSo yeah. Am I the asshole for not forgiving him and moving on?"

I was a picky eater so she would often feed me herself until I was 7. I was the skinny short kid that wore glasses who also had a lisp so I was really quiet in the 1st and 2nd grade, causing her to often be called in by my teacher. I had a lazy eye so I had to get surgery to fix it. I also was allowed braces, to choose a laptop for myself when I was 10 and was allowed 1 year of taekwondo training. \n\nMy argument was that everything she buys for me is worse than my sister. I have an Inspiron while she has an XPS, an iPhone 7 plus with 32gb while she has an X with 256, $30 clothes and shoes while her's are worth 70. Not to mention she recently got an iPad Pro and we also share a room. My mom's excuse was that because my grades are a lot worse than her's. Other than that she also told me how much I complain about her food, and that I don't do anything. \n\nMy mom's a huge hypocrite she doesn't let me cook for myself or do anything. She tried to help her case by saying that I could just ask her to make whatever food I want, despite her refusing to make anything that requires more than 3 steps or is outside of Vietnamese cuisine which when you don't factor in fry food is only around 15 dishes. Other than that she would guilt trip me if I asked for anything, by complaining every day about how expensive it was or would be."

A coworker of hers is celebrating their son\u2019s high school graduation and acceptance into college. They invited us to a BBQ and as a gift, my gf gave them $100. I tried to tell her that it is too much for someone she doesn\u2019t really know (the coworker\u2019s son). I understand if it is a close friend or a wedding but I feel that $100 for a coworker\u2019s son\u2019s high school graduation is too much. She got upset at me for telling her how to spend her money and she said that I was being controlling and I do not get to control how she spends her money because it is her money and not our money. I responded by saying that I understand it is her money but I feel like she could be more responsible with it, especially if we planned to get married and have a joint account in the future. We are in a pretty serious relationship and plan to get married and buy a house. We are trying to save up for a down payment and since she just started working, she does not have a lot saved up yet while I have worked for a few years so I will be solely contributing to the down payment. She is generally responsible with her money but this particular instance just rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like she is giving too much money for a gift to someone she barely knows while I\u2019ve been hard at work and trying to save for our future together throughout all the years that I\u2019ve been working. She thinks I overstepped my bounds since it is her money but I think it is equally important to invest in our future together and that money can be better used for her to put that money toward \u201ccatch up\u201d especially because I\u2019ll be the one solely paying our down payment. I know $100 isn\u2019t a big deal in the grand scheme of things but I just feel alone in saving for our future together.

Of course, I still said that it was ok to talk about them moving as long as it wasn't in the middle of like a fun conversation and I'm not expected to just move on from what they say afterwards. This turned into a big issue and I felt like they weren't listening to what I was saying, and they felt like I was being inconsiderate. I just wanna know whos in the right here so I can either talk to them and apologise profusely, or move on and hope they come to their senses eventually."

            "text": "Me (24M) and my little brother(12M)s father died earlier this year\n\nI stopped seeing my father when i was 14 of my own choice, since he was verbally abusive and manipulative, he was at this point separated from my little brothers mother, who isnt my mother. We tried to stay in touch me and my little brother but it didnt work out and i had not seen him for 8 years until my fathers funeral.\n\nWhen my father died, as heirs it was me and my brothers mom who was in charge of the legalities regarding his estate. This has mostly been a non issue, as he had a lot of debt and not that much of value. We simply hired a lawyer to take care of it as in my country, if the debt exceeds the amount acquired by the deceased's estate then it is paid for by the public. My point is that no one was expecting any money to come off this, until i found out that my little brother had received my fathers pension. Apparently this wasn't part of the estate and he already has these assets in his bank account, although i do not know if they are locked until he is 18. I did not receive any of this money because my father only put my little brother as inheritor on his pension papers.\n\nHere is where i might be the asshole, i think i have just as much a right to the money as my little brother is if not more. My father has previously stolen money from me, he emptied the savings account my family had made for me when i was a kid so that when i became 18 i had nothing. Beyond that i think it is incredibly rude that my little brothers mom didn't even offer me half of the money, instead just assuming i would be satisfied with nothing, even tho i am the one who has suffered under my father the longest.\n\nNow i am wondering whether or not i should ask them for the money or not, so reddit WIBTA if i asked for it?"

Though they went on hiatus and when they came back I was more invested than I was when I first followed and hung around more. Essentially we interacted a lot and he even said me and him had a lot in common. He helped me kind of figure out some IRL friendships I had and gave advice and personal anecdotes and such... \n\nIt was around this point I considered him more than just some guy on twitch and he became a friend in my mind at least. Anyways fast forward a few months and we talk about a lot of different stuff anime, dark souls, Lovecraftian horror, drugs, politics, personal life, weird interactions I've had on twitch. It was, all in all, going pretty normal, we had some good conversations over the last few months though admittedly this past month I don't remember any iconic conversations or anything that stood out, which perhaps indicates some uncomfortableness forming or making itself known... \n\nAnyways, at the time I didn't even think much of that until earlier today or I suppose now it would be late last night. I got off work early so I was scrolling on twitch and saw this guy was live. Haven't stopped in for a while and kind of was in the mood for his particular personality and content, so I jumped in and saw I was banned, at first I thought it was a mistake so then I messaged him on insta and didn't get a response for a bit so hopped on another twitch account and was about to message him when I remembered his friend he was playing with was also streaming, So I hopped onto his stream with my account and saw I was banned by him too. Then fast forward I hop in the guys chat asking him why I was banned on the other account  and he finally responds on Instagram and tells me \n\n\"You always talk about really weird stuff man, and you always talk about the same things and you distract me from what I'm doing, sorry man\" \n\nI just ended up sending him a message on twitch \"You never really said youu had a problem with me, or warned me, maybe i just couldnt read the room, regardless i understand where your coming from, i wont bother you anymore, simply wanted to say that\" I'm including my horrendous grammar, \n\nchecked back a few hours later and he said \"nothing personal man. Just modding my channel.\" and then i tried messaging him again just to say all good but seems like he blocked the other twitch account as well after sending the \"nothing personal message\" ."

Apparently a lot because our apartment billed us $1800 to replace all the carpet. Both my roommate and I had a dog in the apartment so we\u2019re not sure which one of our dogs might have made a mess but ruin the pad underneath the carpet but either way we\u2019re stuck with the bill. I asked for a meeting with my roommate in the leasing office to see if there was anything that could be done about this huge unexpected move out charges. During the meeting I was asking for documentation of our leasing office getting new carpets and for the history of the carpets before we moved in just to make sure that the receipts were in order. Me and my roommate had spoken about this before the meeting and she completely agreed with me that we should ask these questions but when we got in the meeting when I was asking them she was literally shushing me and telling me to stop under her breath. This was just plain embarrassing because it looked like we didn\u2019t have our shii together in front of the leasing manager. after we walked out the meeting I told her that she was being rude to me and I didn\u2019t appreciate it. She then started to argue with me and said that I was the one being rude to the leasing office while really I was just asking questions to make sure all the receipts are in order because at the end of the day we are paying to fully renovate an apartment but we\u2019re never going to step foot in again. Anyways she really pissed me off and even though we decided that we would each pay $100 for the next nine months to cover the moveout charges I\u2019m honestly over the whole situation and I\u2019m leaning towards not paying anything. Now before you automatically call me the asshole when we first moved in together I put the cable and Wi-Fi bill in my name and for the first two months she paid half and then every other month after that when I asked she would tell me that she didn\u2019t have the extra money this month and that she had me next month and even asked me to help her pay rent once and I never got that money back. After 6+ months of paying the cable bill myself i feel like show owes me $900 anyways so she should of be taking care of the damage bill on her own. Btw she moved home so she has extra funds now.

            "text": "First, I know that's a bit harsh but let me explain:\n\nMy(f20) best friend Jenny(23) got her Bachelor's degree this year. I'm really proud of her because it's something I couldn't achieve that easily. Because of mental issues etc.\n\nThat's where it all began. She had problems to first find a job which was not funny. Our friend group helped her as much as we could. After 4 month of looking, she finally got one. \n\nDuring this time she became more and more frustrated. She's that kind of person who gets upset very quick. For example, she was waiting for a package and we could barely convince her not to write a complain to Amazon because it came one day late.\n\nNow's the current situation: Jenny and her fianc\u00e9 are going to move into a new flat in October. They were shopping for new couch and they've also found one. It's supposed to be delivered in October to the new flat because they don't have the space in their current one.\n\nThat's where everything went wrong. A few days ago Jenny got a call that their couch it going to be delivered next week which wasn't what they've arranged with the reseller. Her fianc\u00e9 went to the shop and got everything right. Seems like the company who's delivering fucked up a bit. That's something that can happen and as long as it's all cleared, they don't have to worry, in my opinion.\n\nA day later she got a call from a guy who also ordered some interior from the same reseller but got their delivery note with their names, phone numbers and new address on it. He called Jenny to tell her and to make everything clear because maybe she could have gotten his one.\n\nJenny got furious after that. She wrote a passive aggressive Email to the reseller and the delivery company because she was pissed. She claims that the delivery company doesn't care about data protection and that they are shit (mildly said). Jenny's also thinking about sueing them.\n\nWhen we were talking about that via Discord that evening she was so upset she was about to cry. Her fianc\u00e9 also thinks that she's exaggerating because mistakes like this can happen. I talked about that to my boyfriend because he's also friends with them and called her a Karen for thinking to sue a company for this kind of mistake.\n\nI kinda feel bad for this so I'm asking, AITA?"

The biological father isn't involved in their lives at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJenny and myself have been together around 10 months and I met her sons at around the 6 month mark. The 4 of us have been gradually getting to know each other and i have developed a friendly relationship with her sons who I hang-out with when I visit their home like I play Nintendo, play sport or just chill and chat with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days ago it was Tommy's 6th birthday and Jenny asked me if I would attend and the 4 of us could have something akin to a family dinner.

It\u2019s built into our routine to spend time with each other in friend groups.\n\nMy boyfriend has a\u2026 let\u2019s call it, a very relaxed lifestyle. He spends most of his days on his PC playing games and rarely working. I don\u2019t remember the specifics of it but he earns most of his money through government benefits as a result of mental and physical disabilities. His parents don\u2019t break his way of living, since he is evidently capable of living for himself with his benefits. As a result, he tends to live as recklessly as possible with himself.\n\nI come from a background where I had to be told that not caring enough for my hygiene would have repercussions in the future, so I do my best to take care of myself enough to a point where I don\u2019t risk myself of anything that leads to a hospital visit. I do my best to impose the same to my partner, since I believe he is more at risk of health problems than I am with his current health status. \n\nCut to a few days ago, when we were both in a voice chat together. He mentions loosely that he hasn\u2019t eaten anything at all since waking up. This would be fine if he woke up in the evening, but because he woke up at 8am and it was almost 11pm at the time he said this, I thought that it was absurd that he hadn\u2019t eaten yet. No one in the VC speaks up, so I tell him to eat something, anything. He ignored my words and kept focusing on a game he\u2019s been infatuated with for the past week. I ended up leaving in anger, texting him instead, as I wasn\u2019t about to blow up in front of other people about this. \n\nOnce I regain my cool, I texted him a joking \u201chey, eat something or we\u2019re breaking up\u201d, which he would understand as a joke with deeper incentive behind it since it\u2019s not something I would say usually. No reply. I try again 40 mins later to give him a window of reply, \u201chave you eaten anything yet?\u201d. No reply, again. I could still see whether or not he was playing his game in the VC, so this meant I was actively being ignored. I confronted him 20 mins later with, \u201cplease reply, it\u2019s pissing me off how you aren\u2019t saying anything\u201d, which worked this time. However, the message I got back was being called annoying, which hit a deep rooted nerve in me. \n\nI ended up soft-blocking him just to have space to myself since I never reacted well to negative impressions growing up. I broke down about it, told two of my friends about the situation, that I would be taking a break and don\u2019t want to interact with my BF since he was the last person I expected to call me that. \n\nTLDR, told my boyfriend to eat something since he didn\u2019t eat all day, got told i was annoying directly and don\u2019t speak to him atm. AITA?"

I had broken up a relationship at the time and was jobless. My parents allowed me to come back even tho they would have preferred I find my own place so I can \u201cgrow up.\u201d It's not an ideal situation for me to be here either at this age.\n\nI worked from Feb 2021 - May 2021 then got laid off. I paid rent here from Feb - July even tho my parents said not to but I compensated them anyways because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I injured my knee right after I got laid off and have arthritis on both my wrists so I haven\u2019t looked for a job yet but I will ASAP once my knee has been cleared by the doctor. I can't WFH because desk jobs hurt my wrists &amp; WFH never worked out well for me. I need to find something in-person but can't right now because of my leg.\n\nMy brother and his GF have been together for a while since sophomore year of high school. My brother has to wait until next year to get into nursing school and his GF is still at university for another 1.5 yrs.\n\nBefore I moved in, I did hear that the GF was over all the time but didn\u2019t think much of it as I had my own stuff to worry about &amp; since I didn\u2019t experience it first hand I didn\u2019t know what I would be feeling. I have always been bothered by the frequency &amp; duration of her visits but it only became excessive for me recently. Also, since I was unemployed when I first got here and my bro helped me move back, I just said I'll deal with it for now.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the reasons why I've gotten increasingly annoyed:\n\n\\- She visits majority of the week. Rarely is she not here.\n\n\\- Her visits can be 12+ hours sometimes. Sometimes she's here the whole 12 hours.\n\n\\- She parks in the driveway (my parent's permit this). But I think it's rude when my dad is a 100% disabled veteran, my mom breaks her back daily at her nursing job working 6 days a week, and I have an injured knee. I had to park on the street once cos her car was parked in the driveway! I know my parent's have final say, but I think it's just so damn rude to park at someones house when you don't live there! \n\nThey can't go to her place to hang out because her mom is supposedly super strict &amp; doesn't know about my brother dating her even though its been years. I don't know in what ways the mom is 'strict' but I do believe it because the GF will go to great lengths to lie about where she is and her dad will cover up for her. My issue is that, while it's not the GF's fault for having an unwelcoming home, GF is placing that burden on me by being here all day everyday.\n\nI understand that if I don't like things, I can find my own place but I still legally and rightfully live here and so my issue is that as a resident of this household, I believe I am entitled to some damn space and privacy without having to be shoved into my room to get it.\n\nWho is the AH? Me? My brother? The GF?"

I woke up this morning and she said that I need to pump the tyres up which is fair enough, so I agreed to do it before I went. Then she said that I need to wear a hat, I replied something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ll decide when I get there\u201d. Obviously if I was riding on the road I would wear a hat 100% of the time, but we are only riding through the woods. The reason I pushed back on this is because I felt like it was being pushed on me and I feel like it\u2019s only natural to push back a little when people try to tell you what to do. She also said that it is her bike, which I replied I\u2019m not sure that has to do anything to do with whether I wear a hat or not (I know that she was only looking out for my safety and I understand that, but the way it was said I felt that she was being a bit of a tyrant about it. She then replied something like \u201cdont\n be stupid\u201d and claimed that I wouldn\u2019t exactly be going slow, to which I said that I wouldn\u2019t be going that fast (I\u2019m not going to go that fast haha)\n\nSo the argument escalated a little and I said that she was just on a power trip. This really annoyed her and she stormed off downstairs. \n\nI went down and said very calmly \u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind of reaction you expected when you are trying to force me to do something\u201d.

My dad and her say that I take things in the \u201cwrong\u201d way and she said she shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cfluff things up to a 23 year old\u201d.

When his daughter (Stella, now 24) was 4, we got together again and now we've been married for 18 years and have one more kid. Stella has split her time between our house and her mother's since she was 5, but she's lived with us full time since she was 18. Where we are, it's quite common for adult children to live with their parents until they're financially stable or want to move in with someone. Adam lived with us until he got married at 27 and Stella still lives with us. Stella wasn't very good with money when she started working, so we started charging her for \"rent\" to help her save (she knows it's because of that and that we put the money on a savings account for her). We never did this with Adam, because he was always responsible with his finances.\n\nAdam now lives about one hour away and has a baby. He works 4 days a week and his wife is still on maternity leave so when he has his off days in a row, they come to stay with us. These days don't always fall on weekends. The problem here is that Stella works from home and she sometimes needs to work nights. Some of these nights have fallen on days Adam is here. The last time it happened, Stella got extremely upset because the baby cried a lot and her boss said on a call it was \"unprofessional\". So, she asked us if it was possible for Adam not to come when she has to work nights. We told her no, as Adam is only able to come here when his work allows and we don't want to have to make his stays even rarer. We don't have any more available bedrooms she could move into, so we said that the best we could do was try to convert a part of our garage into a little workstation for her. She got really angry again, because she says the garage isn't comfortable and she shouldn't have to move her workspace just because Adam stays here occasionally. We told her she could work from there only occasionally, but since she has a lot of cables, monitors, devices, things, she says that's not feasible. So, we had this huge fight where we told her this was take it or leave it and she started accusing us of favoring Adam, saying we're willing to accomodate him more than her, that we charge her rent when we never charged him and that should mean she has more control over this house, and that we should be ashamed for suggesting that she should work in a garage. She then implied it was because she was not my bio daughter. I simply left the room, and my husband kept arguing with her, at which point I overheard her call us some not-so-nice names.\n\nMy husband and I were pretty certain about our positions, but honestly, her accusing us of favoritism is making us feel terrible. AITA?"

She has deified their star player and knows pretty much everything about the rest of them. She doesn't watch a lot of NRL games unless it's her team whereas I try to watch as many as possible every week. \n\nI was genuinely curious as to whether she liked NRL as a game and enjoyed watching the sport or if she really just liked her team (not the individual players but the team as an institution) so I asked her. She interpreted this as me asking whether she liked the game or just obsessed over the individual players and their looks. I tried to explain to her my thinking but she just thinks I'm sexist and insists I wouldn't ask a man that (I would btw but she doesn't believe me). \n\nI totally understand her being upset if I had asked her version of the question but I didn't and I don't think my question was actually sexist.

I dropped out of university, moved to another city and found a job in a call center as I wanted to be the one bearing the economic burden of this expensive school. \nWhen I told my parents what I was gonna do they were pretty supportive: my father was happy (as a comics enthusiast himself) but my mother wasn't exactly stoked about the whole thing. I get that, she wasn't expecting this turn of events and despite that she tried to show some enthusiasm. I appreciate this effort, that must not have been easy for her.\nIn the last months though things have been kinda harsh as I'm struggling with some insecurities (mostly about my drawing skills but also other important aspects of my life). Thing is when I'm dealing with this kind of anxiety I tend to avoid the problem. So basically I play a lot of videogames to numb my thoughts. I know that's not the best way to cope with this issues and therapy would be of great help but right now I can't afford it... \nSo my mom has seen that, despite having finished school two months ago, I'm not working as an artist yet and at least once a week she asks about what I'm going to do with my life. This just makes my anxiety worse and I tried to tell her. So she stopped talking about it but has started sending me instructions on how to join the Police \"just in case you need a backup plan\". She also told me that I could have joined many other art schools that are better than the one I did go to. \nHonestly how can I not take that as a sign that she doesn't believe in me? \nA few days ago we were watching TV and all of a sudden she says that I should consider going back to university \"Just in case you need a backup plan\". I snapped, started crying and I told her that this kind of suggestions are making my anxiety a lot worse. It's not an easy task to deal with this problem and she is not helping... At this point she began telling me the same old shit about how she is doing that just cause she wants the best for me etc.\nAfter arguing for 20 mins she DEMANDS to see every single piece of art that I made in the last weeks. She also confesses that she has gone through my sketchbook while I was showering to see how much I exercised in the last days.\nAt this point I didn't wanna talk anymore so I just walked away.\nAfter a couple hours my father comes to ask me if I wanna join them for dinner and I accept (dunno why). What I found was my mother weeping at the table waiting for me and my father. We had dinner in complete silence and after that I went out to meet some friends... Two days have passed and we haven't addressed that topic again.\nNow I feel kinda guilty since she didn't mean to make my problems worse. At the same time though I think that my feelings deserve more respect and maybe this can be a lesson for her. AITA?"

Everyone in our family is cool with it for the most part.\n\nRecently my dad and brother got into a heated argument because our dad set some strict ground rules for my brother and his boyfriend. Now my brother has a curfew and can't be out with his boyfriend at certain times during the night and he can't go to his boyfriends house, even if his parents are home and vice versa.\n\nMy brother thinks these new rules are unfair since my dad never made my sister and I follow them, he says it's not fair that we get to see our partners but he can't see his boyfriend. This caused a massive fight between them and my dad said some pretty nasty things to him in the process. \n\nThey're not talking to each other at the moment and my brothers been really bummed out these past few days. I understand him being moody over this but everytime I walk past his door I can hear him crying. This morning he finally made himself some breakfast after locking himself in his room for 3 days. I asked him a question and he ignored me, this pissed me off so I said he needs to pull himself together and to stop being so fucking dramatic. He just threw his breakfast away and went back into his room without saying anything.\n\nI don't get why he can't just suck it up and follow the rules our dad set in place for him instead of talking back. It's not the end of the world and crying over it is childish. However, my sister ripped into me earlier saying I should be more understanding and empathetic towards him and says that I'm acting really cold-hearted. Especially since we never had to follow these same ground rules. I don't think I'm being an ass, but what do you guys think?\n\n\nTL;DR; my dad set strict ground rules for my brother and his boyfriend. My brother is really upset about this and thinks it's unfair since my sister and I never had to deal with these BS rules when it comes to dating. I snapped at him and told him to stop crying over it and to just listen to our dad."

            "text": "I [22F] live in an apartment about an hour drive from my parents\u2019 house.  I moved out last summer.  My parents have a small dog who will be 13-14? this year.  Ever since I moved out, their dog has become increasingly more sick.  She is old and has pancreatitis, but I\u2019ve never seen it this bad. \n\nA few days ago, around 5am, my mom called me while I was on a trip saying the dog is bleeding everywhere and she\u2019s at the ER now.  Later that morning, once I was fully awake, I called to ask how the dog is.  Dog needed to stay in ER for minimum 3 days for monitoring.  ER ends up discharging her early because \u201cshe has an appetite\u201d. Dog still has diarrhea and couldn\u2019t hold her own head up. \n\nI visited my parents today to check up on the dog. Dog was not doing great. Trouble breathing and wheezing loudly. I told my parents she needed to go back and the ER discharged her too early. My mom and I took her back, and it was there that they found the dog has an enlarged heart, which could contribute to the breathing issues. Vet gave a pain killer shot (stomach) and recommended giving the other pain med she was already prescribed in conjunction because they work well together. Vet goes on to say the dog needs to see a cardiologist for medications because it will lead to congestive heart failure. To this my mom replied \u201cWell she\u2019s got to die from something!\u201d and laughed. \n\nWhen we got home, I said to my parents (because dad always sides with mom), that I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re just going to let her die knowing there\u2019s something they could do. My mom initially stood by her statement and went on about how she\u2019s just a dog and it\u2019s not worth the money. After I argued how disgusting that is she said \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d just so I would stop talking. Then she brought up the next time the dog is due for pain meds. 8-12 hours between each dose.  This dog is laying on the couch trembling and wheezing, and she says \u201cI\u2019ll wait until 12 hours\u201d. I said \u201cDo you guys just not take care of her because it\u2019s inconvenient to you?\u201d to which my dad yelled to \u201cstop hitting us about this\u201d. The biggest issue for them is money. That and they are generally considerably less empathetic than most people I know.  They fall in the lower middle class range. \n\nMy parents then sternly implied I needed to leave. I\u2019m not paying the medical bill for the dog, but our family took the responsibility to care for her. That dog relies on us to do what\u2019s best for her and she cannot advocate for herself. I feel guilty for shaming them when I know money isn\u2019t perfect. AITA for criticizing my parents?"

She was my first ever love, and we had been close friends since uni started.

She insisted she loved me \u2013 but broke things off only 5 months into our relationship. She said we weren\u2019t compatible, because we were too different, but we\u2019d always worked as friends.

Managed to get caught up in the beach traffic rush and the parking lot was full, so I parked in a corner of a U-shaped lot that was striped off. No it wasn\u2019t adjacent to any handicap spots and I wasn\u2019t blocking any type of accessibility as there were no curbs. If there was some sort of hydrant I couldn\u2019t see then I would\u2019ve been able to leave much sooner than a fire truck would\u2019ve been able to arrive. I\u2019m pretty sure the yellow stripes were in that corner spot for better visibility. \n\nI got my stuff in 2 minutes tops and the guy working the donations for veterans table stops me and tells me I can\u2019t park there. Mind you he was staring directly at my car while I was walking in and didn\u2019t say anything. I indulge in his need to make a comment about how I\u2019m a shit bag and he goes off on a tangent about he used to be a cop. He literally ends up spending more time talking to me than time I spent parked before we started the conversation. \n\nI figured that because I wasn\u2019t inconveniencing anyone and that I would be gone quickly, that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. My other option would\u2019ve been to possibly block the road waiting for someone to leave which I would\u2019ve done had there been more obvious downsides. Is there something I\u2019m missing? Is this a case of being technically incorrect is worse than being practical?"

            "text": "My brother and I was supposed to meet my cousin's in-laws and her family told us that only one of us could go. Since my brother saw the gifts they made for the in-laws, they wanted him to go. But because I had already had a bath and sorted out my outfit for the day. My mum told the bride's family that I was gonna go but they were disappointed because they really wanted my brother to go. I felt a bit taken aback by this. I still powered through because I needed to have that stiff upper lip as I was gonna go to the bride's house to collect gifts to go to the in-laws house. My sister saw my t-shirt and it was a WWE t-shirt and I told her that I was going to be wearing a jacket over it anyway. She gave me a disgusted look as I wore it even though there was nothing bad on the t-shirt. She told me to get changed which as you can probably guess p***ed me off.\n\nI told my brother how much it reminded me of that awful time when my sister said that I couldn't wear my suit to her graduation and I had to wear my brother's suit instead. I refused because I like to wear my own clothes and not someone else's. Specifically, something that I bought with my own money. During this, my sister (who hadn't heard my conversation with my brother) is whispering to my brother to give me some of his clothes which literally gave me flashbacks to my sister's graduation. I know neither day was about me but I still have the right to feel comfortable in what I wear, right?\n\nMy brother gave me a lecture about how I'm representing the family but I just play it off in a kind of annoyed manner because I was fuming up until that point. They thought that I didn't care about impressing the in-laws so when we got to my sister's car, I just burst into tears. I knew I couldn't hold back anymore but the fact that it was an important day but not for me so I couldn't complain just completely broke me. \n\nMy sister told me that I can control the aux for the car ride and as I played music that I like which is different to the type of music that they all like. One sister said \"Ngl this is actually a bop\" and they both seemed to enjoy it which was weird because they normally hate the music that I like. However recently, I talked to my sister about the song and she didn't remember it. She only pretended to like it to make me feel better. I came to the realisation that the whole reason for trying to make me feel better wasn't so I would be happy and less depressed going forward but so that I wouldn't be upset when going to the houses that we were visiting. \n\nI was at my cousin's house ready to pick up the gift baskets to give to the in-laws until one of my sisters says for me to pull my pants up. I glared at them for a bit before pulling my pants up. They walked laughing saying \"He hates us haha\". You're probably wondering why I got annoyed at them then, but basically imagine if someone made fun of your face and then told you that you had spinach in your teeth."

The other boy said that they were calling their parents to take the injured one to hospital but wanted me to help store the broken finger(which I will not go into detailed description) in a cool place.\n\n\nI took the finger and put it into one of our cake boxes and put it in our chiller. About 20 minutes later an adult woman(assuming is the injured boy's mother) came and asked for the finger and I passed it to her.

I have no idea how the boy broke his finger but I hope it can be reattached. \n\n\nWhen my manager came back to close the shop she was very angry when I told her what I did and said I was contaminanting the cakes with the finger and could get us into deep trouble. We spent 1 hour cleaning and disinfecting the chiller before putting the goods back inside.\n\n\nShe warned me again before we went off for the day that if the same thing happen do not do anything like that again. I really want to argue that I was just trying to save a poor kid's finger but I don't want more trouble already. I think she is being unreasonable to not want to help with a simple request.\n\n\nAita for putting the finger in our chiller together with the cakes? I did seal the cake box properly so pretty sure nothing got out and nobody knew what was inside even if they looked, and it was just for maybe 20 minutes till the parent came to get it."

Everyone in our family is cool with it for the most part.\n\nRecently my dad and brother got into a heated argument because our dad set some strict ground rules for my brother and his boyfriend. Now my brother has a curfew and can't be out with his boyfriend at certain times during the night and he can't go to his boyfriends house, even if his parents are home and vice versa.\n\nMy brother thinks these new rules are unfair since my dad never made my sister and I follow them, he says it's not fair that we get to see our partners but he can't see his boyfriend. This caused a massive fight between them and my dad said some pretty nasty things to him in the process. \n\nThey're not talking to each other at the moment and my brothers been really bummed out these past few days. I understand him being moody over this but everytime I walk past his door I can hear him crying. This morning he finally made himself some breakfast after locking himself in his room for 3 days. I asked him a question and he ignored me, this pissed me off so I said he needs to pull himself together and to stop being so fucking dramatic. He just threw his breakfast away and went back into his room without saying anything.\n\nI don't get why he can't just suck it up and follow the rules our dad set in place for him instead of talking back. It's not the end of the world and crying over it is childish. However, my sister ripped into me earlier saying I should be more understanding and empathetic towards him and says that I'm acting really cold-hearted. Especially since we never had to follow these same ground rules. I don't think I'm being an ass, but what do you guys think?\n\n\nTL;DR; my dad set strict ground rules for my brother and his boyfriend. My brother is really upset about this and thinks it's unfair since my sister and I never had to deal with these BS rules when it comes to dating. I snapped at him and told him to stop crying over it and to just listen to our dad."

We've been long-distance starting 3.5 years ago and we're still long distance.\n\nTherapy has been a very important part of my life. I started therapy 6 years ago (for depression/anxiety) thanks to my boyfriend's initial encouragement. He's been supportive along the way. He sometimes asks what was discussed in the sessions and I sometimes disclose to him what was discussed and how he can better support me. To me, I find it important in a relationship to be as transparent as possible. Years ago, I suggested therapy to my bf too, but he'd tell me that he doesn't need it at the moment. And that's fine, I leave it at that.\n\nFast forward to today, I randomly ask my bf over the phone if he's ever done therapy, and he mentioned that he did therapy sometime last year. I was immediately audibly shocked and upset because this was the first I heard about it. I did start by asking him what it was about and how it went, and I did state that I was happy that he sought help when needed. But then I soon voiced how upset I was that he never told me. And that I would probably have never found out if I didn't ask. To me, it seemed like something as important as therapy should've been mentioned to me.\n\nFrom what he told me, he was never uncomfortable with telling me; he just didn't see it as that important to mention. But knowing that he knows how important therapy is to me, I think he should've brought it up. Even if he told me like soon after he finished his therapy sessions. Overall, he wasn't happy with my reaction, but I reiterated to him that I'm happy and proud of him that he sought help, but just upset with how I found out. AITA here?"

            "text": "My gf and I got into an argument about the amount of money she is giving as a gift. A coworker of hers is celebrating their son\u2019s high school graduation and acceptance into college. They invited us to a BBQ and as a gift, my gf gave them $100. I tried to tell her that it is too much for someone she doesn\u2019t really know (the coworker\u2019s son). I understand if it is a close friend or a wedding but I feel that $100 for a coworker\u2019s son\u2019s high school graduation is too much. She got upset at me for telling her how to spend her money and she said that I was being controlling and I do not get to control how she spends her money because it is her money and not our money. I responded by saying that I understand it is her money but I feel like she could be more responsible with it, especially if we planned to get married and have a joint account in the future. We are in a pretty serious relationship and plan to get married and buy a house. We are trying to save up for a down payment and since she just started working, she does not have a lot saved up yet while I have worked for a few years so I will be solely contributing to the down payment. She is generally responsible with her money but this particular instance just rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like she is giving too much money for a gift to someone she barely knows while I\u2019ve been hard at work and trying to save for our future together throughout all the years that I\u2019ve been working. She thinks I overstepped my bounds since it is her money but I think it is equally important to invest in our future together and that money can be better used for her to put that money toward \u201ccatch up\u201d especially because I\u2019ll be the one solely paying our down payment. I know $100 isn\u2019t a big deal in the grand scheme of things but I just feel alone in saving for our future together. I also asked if she could work more shifts to earn a little extra and she got further upset at me saying how I\u2019m just viewing her as a piggy bank with no consideration for her health (since her job in healthcare is physically demanding). AITA for telling my gf how she should spend her money?"

On mobile for please forgive any typos/formatting issues.\n\nSo I (22F) recently got married to the LOML (26M). We had been family friends for many, many years (like before we were even born), we started dating when I was 19 and when he popped the question, we decided to get married legally and have our religious ceremonies as well but wait until I graduate university before having the \"white dress reception\" and living together. We are long distance atm. So I'm not really close to my step-cousin (her dad is my mom's step brother), and since I kinda got married in a rush (husband's grandmother was in a delicate health situation, RIP), she had NO IDEA I had anyone in my life, let alone married. \n\nMy husband decided to visit me recently, and my cousin was also visiting me. There was a knock and my cousin opened the door to see my husband (who, mind you, is aesthetically way out of my league) so she starts flirting with him. I signal my husband to not react. Not necessarily flirt back, just don't yank yourself away from him.\n\nGrowing up, I was ways compared to my step-cousin. How pretty she is, how fair she is, how skinny and tall she is etc. I have battled with being overwait my whole life (and I still am on the chubbier side), while being below average height. If you saw my husband, you honestly wouldn't think that we're together. I was also a tom boy, so I had lots of male friends. Step cousin assumes that my husband is my friend and continues to flirt with him. I would like to add that my husband had no issues with this, he honestly thought it's a good way to get revenge for all the years she made me feel like shit.\n\nSo this is where I think I might be the asshole."

I still don't know a lot of things about his past, except for the fact that he carries a lot of unresolved baggage. I don't really push him for details, since I've always figured that he'll just tell me if he ever wants to. He's kind of a quiet tough guy too, which is why his reaction took me off guard.\n\nI've seen him writing in a notebook before bed for these past few weeks, but he got flustered and put it away when I asked what it was, so I didn't mention it again. I did a bit of late work last night so he went to sleep first, and when I went into the room he had left the notebook out on the bed. I picked it up to put it away but curiosity got the best of me and I reopened it to the first page, assuming that it's probably something mundane if he fell asleep with it out. I was wrong, it described a graphic ptsd(?) dream he had and I stopped reading after the first paragraph.\n\nHe confronted me about it this morning and I hemmed and hawed a bit at first, but ultimately admitted that I did read it because I thought lying about it would make him angrier. He totally lost it, I've never seen the man this upset before. Like, yelling at me with tears streaking down his face before sobbing and storming away. I couldn't really do anything besides apologize and tell him that I didn't know it was his diary because he never told me. He's cooled down enough to let me cuddle him, but is verbally short with me and sulking. I think it's already a done deal, but parts of the situation feel a bit unfair to me. There's no way I could've known what he wrote in the notebook was that personal, but my friend called me a dumbass when I texted him earlier. Am I the A?"

This was my third time moving out and first time being on my own.\n\nI turned 24 yesterday. Unfortunately I had to move back in with my aunt. After my job cut my pay I can\u2019t afford rent, especially now that I\u2019m on maternity leave.\n\nI owe her everything for raising me and keeping me on track, and even though I\u2019m not a child anymore she still helps with important matters.\n\nSo I\u2019m trying to move away from the overbearing help, because I am old enough to figure more things out on my own, like taxes and health insurance. But it\u2019s like my aunt doesn\u2019t recognize me as being my own person and wants to control everything.\n\nWhen I ask a simple question she beats allll around the bush and asks a million questions in return. Only towards the end will I be able to pull out an answer. When I ask why she can\u2019t simply answer, she says I can\u2019t orchestrate how the conversation goes.\n\nThe last few times I ranted about how crazy my baby daddy is, her response is \u201cyou\u2019re the one that got pregnant by him\u201d. Yes, shit happens. But I find it very disheartening for this to be her favorite response when I\u2019m obviously in a position I don\u2019t want to be in, and am looking for validation from my family. I\u2019ve told her how it makes me feel to hear her say this, but she claims she\u2019s tired of hearing about him. That I can\u2019t control how she responds.\n\nSo when should respect go both ways? Apparently I\u2019m disrespectful for asking her the same sort of questions she asks me. A few weeks ago she asks, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you start packing already? You knew you were moving, so you should\u2019ve brought stuff over while you were still able.\u201d Mind you, I\u2019m almost 9 months pregnant and stopped lifting heavy items at work months ago.\n\nAfter we were able to move my items, I have no free space to store my things. All her closets are full of craft supplies. So I parallel the question back to her, \u201cDo you know when the closets will be cleared out? You knew a while ago that I was moving in.\u201d And I\u2019m only sorta \u201cjoking\u201d. But I can\u2019t \u201cdisrespect\u201d her like she does me.\n\nSo my grandmother also lives with my aunt. Tonight I\u2019m downstairs in my grandmother\u2019s \u201capartment\u201d ranting to her about yet another disagreement I had with my aunt. My aunt hears, comes downstairs, and starts screaming about how horrible I am to complain to my her. My aunt says I\u2019m causing my gram emotional distress, and that if I don\u2019t like something she says, I should just deal with it alone. For the hundredth time, she reminds me that I\u2019m in her house, so I can\u2019t dictate the conversation. \n\nAITA for cursing her out in her own home? My throat is sore from screaming over her screams. I\u2019m venting to my grandmother in what I thought was a \u201csafe space\u201d, and she wants to control that even. At what point can respect go both ways? Is there an understanding we should come to?"

My grandma moved into another state when I was 12 even then she never visited us or when we reached we had no responds from her and she barely contacted me or any one in my family when she left to another state. We did visit her one time and then never spoke to her until recently when she stayed over at our home since she was sick. She kept denying being covid tested or getting help.  Turns out she was covid positive since my sister and all family members took tests and it came out positive due my grandma spreading it around.When she passed away, it turns out she had been consistently contacting and keeping in touch with other parts of mom\u2019s family and it was clear she favored them due they\u2019re images of being a good Christian family because we didn\u2019t have a dad since he passed away and it was obvious she stopped contacting us due this event.

Me and my dad both wear this to go out to airsoft I have removed all things that said U.S. military or something to that effect from them since their not really supposed to have that anyways. \n\nHere's the issue when we go to games we get dressed at home and start the 1-2 hour drive to the field. We usually stop at like walmart or kum&amp;go and pick up something to drink or eat. I typically wear a white tshirt under my UCP so I'll take off the top part when we go into places but I cant really take off my pants my dad just wears the full thing in. We've had multiple people come up and thank us for our service when we haven't served at all which makes me really uncomfortable beacause I dont deserve to be thanked for something I never did especially something like that. The first time I tried to say that we weren't service members and that we we're going to airsoft when my dad interrupted me. Once we got to the car he explained that I shouldn't do that beacause it just complicates things.\n\nThe other thing that makes me even more uncomfortable is when we get some form of discount we've never asked for one but sometimes they give it automatically. My dad's reasoning for why its okay is that he's a police officer and the places here would give us the same discount if he asked for it. I've all but given up trying to explain and correct people beacause when I do it irritates my dad but I dont think I should be accepting something that I dont deserve whether it be a thanks or a discount so reddit AITA?"

My mom was married before she had me, had five kids, decided she didn't want to be with her husband anymore, screwed him over pretty royally and made that relationship bad. Then she had me with a guy who was into all kinds of messed up stuff. When I was born I had no father willing to claim me. She and her husband never divorced but he wasn't around me, he was around for his kids though my mom tried to get him to take me on too. I get that he couldn't. I was the kid of the person who fucked him over badly.\n\nShe had two guys in her life after and neither of them wanted me either. At one point the four of us were in the same house for six solid years and neither one of them paid me any attention. My mom saw it as okay because they weren't my dad and they were there for her and not me. It really fucked me up. Add to that my half siblings really hated me for what our mom had done and did not like when they came to mom's and had to see me. Then there was my mom's parents who favored them because they loved my siblings dad more than mom, their daughter, because she had fucked them over too.\n\nSo I grew up basically nobody wanting me. I had a couple of friends. But I struggled to make and maintain relationships and it took a lot of therapy for me to be okay. And I won't lie I probably still don't have the best idea of healthy relationships and still crave a family. But I'll probably never get to be that lucky. And that's despite my boyfriend being great and me having him as a support system along with some friends.\n\nThree weeks ago I found out one of the boyfriends died and my mom was torn up about it. I ended up showing up to confront her because when I had tried to let it all out to her before, she had blocked me on social media and refused to answer the door to me or shut me down when I was still a minor living with her. So I dumped it all out. That she had fucked me up and chose men over me, chose to be with men who didn't want a thing to do with me, and who never gave me the love I deserved as a kid. I felt so much better afterward. It was like I could finally let it all out and move on.

I\u2019m 20 now, but I was 14 at the time, so I\u2019m alright being called an asshole now since it was a while ago but honestly I think I was totally in the right.\n\nI (M) am Jewish. I grew up in a majority Jewish area (only 3 of the 20 kids in my kindergarten class were Christian) so I never believed in Santa nor knew anyone who did. I\u2019m not religious at all, but I am somewhat uneasy with religious Christians (centuries of hate and all that). The religious aspect isn\u2019t too important but basically I find the whole concept of believing in Santa weird, as I never even met anyone growing up who believed in it.\n\nSo basically, I was at my second cousins house on Christmas Eve for a party. Their father is Jewish, but their mother is very Christian and raised the kids Christian too. Me and my twin sister were talking with two of our cousins, who were 14f and 13m at the time. My sister and I weren\u2019t getting along particularly great with the two of them, they always act stuck-up and rude to us, although we were 14 at the time so I\u2019m sure that we were probably a bit of AHs to them too. We had been arguing all night, and they had said something along the lines of \u201cSanta doesn\u2019t give you presents because you\u2019re Jewish and don\u2019t like him or Jesus\u201d (which is true, but still kinda rude). They had open this Santa tracker app where you could track Santa as he travels across the globe. I asked them how Santa could give presents to every house in that short amount of time. They said he used magic to deliver every gift down every chimney. I pointed out that they didn\u2019t have a chimney and that their parents already had left gifts under the tree. This made them really angry, and accused me and my sister of \u201cnot believing in Santa and Christmas cheer\u201d or something like that. I told them that yeah I don\u2019t believe in Santa and that he\u2019s not real. They were offended and didn\u2019t believe me. I told them to literally look it up and they did and on the spot realized he wasn\u2019t real. They started crying and told their younger siblings, who were like 6, 8, and 9 at the time and I feel bad for them finding out. It ruined the whole party, their parents were really mad at my parents and said that we ruined Christmas. We left shortly after.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole? I think that 14 is way too old to believe in Santa. I was in 8th grade at the time, and kids were starting to hook up, drink, smoke etc. at the time and were def far from believing in magic. But I also never believed in Santa, so maybe I just don\u2019t understand. AITA?"

We both don't work this August so we had the idea to go on vacation together. 3 hours later we had booked our flight and hotel in Venice, Italy. We were really excited and told Anna when she joined us after her visitors left.\n\n She wasn't. She cried and hung up. Look the thing is I love Anna but I don't wanna spend every day in my room because she has to.  I understand that she is upset that we go on vacation without her because she has been friends with us individually longer and we are Basically a trio but I don't wanna miss out on this experience because her parents don't allow her to go to. She asked us to cancel it and wait until next year so we can all go together because she hopes her parents let her do more when she is 19. We have already paid our flights and hotel we would lose a ton of money. \n\nI don't she is entitled to ask us to do this. Now she says I'm an Asshole, am I?"

Our son dropped bubble mixture on our holiday apartment floor so I got a towel out the bathroom and cleaned up the floor. I knew it was her towel but it had already been used for everyone's showers so I figured it wouldn't make much of a difference. She said she didn't want me to use it because it was her only towel for swimming later. When I told her that it was already used anyway, she got angry and told me to use it and she'll just have to go without anything. Then she stompt off to another room and won't talk to me now. My mother isn't happy with her for trying to cause drama on our holiday. I've hung it up so it will dry and be fine for later. \n\nTbf we did bring floor wipes and paper towels with us because the place we are at always needs a clean when we first get in, but I didn't think to use them at the time and thought a towel was the best option. If it were me I wouldn't be bothered and would be fine with it, its just a towel and she's only gonna dry herself off with it. Is what I did so bad as what she is making out like?"

One of the people in the conversation was from Canada, which I didn't know about and went on believing the discussion was over US police. At one point they cut in talking about their experiences in Canada directed at me, as if expecting an answer. So I said that I was sorry to hear it happened, but that I was talking about US police and that I would like to keep my focus there since I don't know enough about what happens in CA to really speak on it. Then that person proceeded to get offended with that response, and a couple of their friends also in the discussion had similar reactions.\n\nWas that actually the wrong thing to do there or is that just a case of friends backing up friends unconditionally?"

            "text": " \n\nI\u2019m a big believer in supporting worthy small businesses, and the idea of having a ramen shop near my house is a dream. I ordered their tonkatsu ramen via GrubHub and as I just finished checking out I realized I ordered their tonkatsu and not the spicy tonkatsu as I wanted. A mistake that is completely and totally my fault I know. I figured I could just call the place and sort things out but as I called they would not answer. I assumed they were busy so after calling twice I decided to wait for a few minutes to give the staff time to calm down a possible rush. I called back again and no answer, I tried one final time, they answered, set the phone down never even spoke a word to me. I said \"Hello?\" a few times and then realized they did it in an attempt to get me to stop calling.\n\nI hung up now insisting that I talk to someone, and I called again...Annnnd they blocked my number.\n\nI detest people who are hard or disrespectful to people in the customer service industry, I\u2019ve worked there and I understand. However, silly behavior like that is simply unacceptable, regardless if you\u2019re swamped or not, a simple answer and \"Hi, please hold for a moment\" would have sufficed, but they couldn\u2019t even give me that. \n\nAs I said, I try extremely hard to treat those in the customer service industry with respect, I don\u2019t want to be a crazy Karen, but blocking my number left a dirty taste in my mouth, and despite my desire to not be crazy, I decided to drive to the restaurant to complain.\n\nI get there, walk in and with a smile on my face and in a polite tone I ask to speak to the manager, the hostess askes why and I tell her, \"I tried to call the business and you guys wouldn\u2019t answer.\" \n\nI knew immediately she recognized me and she was the person who was rejecting my calls. She looks at me and says the exact words I was expecting \"we can\u2019t answer the phone, it\u2019s too busy\" she tells me. \n\nI slowly look around, realizing that the restaurant is at half capacity and there were 4-5 waitresses and hostesses working in a place that really only needed two maybe 3. I keep my smile and I request again to speak to a manager. \n\nShe walks back to get them and returns a few minutes later saying, \"they said that you can just talk to me.\"Despite her smug smile and the clear feeling of justification in her eyes because they were \"too busy\" I politely told her that I hope the business succeeds, but with customer service like that and blatant disregard for the people who are buying their expensive ramen, I\u2019m less optimistic about their success. It\u2019s unfortunate to see how ignored I was and how little they cared for the people keeping them in business during the pandemic, and the fact that I couldn\u2019t even get the time of day to speak rationally and calmly to management is just extremely unprofessional."

So, in order to prove it was him i asked for a picture of his poop so that i could compare them and see if it was his. At first he said no but then he eventually agreed as we are very close.\n\nAfter looking at his poop i realized it was definitely not him and he mentioned that it was probably our neighbor who has been very mean to us for no reason. Our neighbor has been leaving random fruits and vegetables in our driveway and also sent us a fake letter from our landlord saying that we have been dirty but i havent been dirty. Also our back yard is not gated and you can walk back there and no one can see you.\n\nMy posts on other subreddits led to people calling me weird but i feel like theyre not putting themselves in my shoes.\n\nIf someone was mad and pooped in your back yard wouldnt you want to find out who did it?"

My husband is the oldest of three sons and me and my MIL have a great relationship - I absolutely adore her and the rest of the family, and  I love that we share common values when it comes to family.\n\nMy second oldest brother in law recently got married and although his new wife is very sweet, her and my MIL\u2019s relationship (along with the relationship between their families) has not gone as smoothly as we all hoped. Needless to say my MIL did not 100% enjoy dealing with her or her family during the wedding planning process. But now they are married so we all just need to move forward. \n\nImportant thing to note: We are Muslim and if someone in our family is interested in a potential partner, that is a big deal and we would only hear about the potential partner once the person is ready to take next step (marriage!). It is normal to be in the talking phase for up to a year before they tell their family, at which point they would have to start making arrangements to be engaged.\n\nMy new SIL recently told me that she played matchmaker (during her wedding!) for our MIL\u2019s third and youngest son, who is single. She thought it would be a good idea to match him with her cousin. I was excited to hear that my youngest BIL was talking to someone, but when I had time to think about it I realized I\u2019m not too thrilled with the idea that it\u2019s her cousin. Given the fact that her and my husbands family struck a few pain points and are not off to a super great start, I know my MIL would not be super thrilled with this news either. I also thought about what this would mean for me and I can\u2019t help but feel a little jealous or potentially left out if both of my BILs ended up marrying into the same family. I love my sister in law but she does not hang out with our family very often and can already see a little club that would only include her, her cousin, and their husbands. I\u2019ve always dreamed of the day when we\u2019d all be married and have kids and would be super close, but with this scenario I know it just wouldn\u2019t work out that way - it would feel somewhat two-sided with me and my husband as the third wheels.\n\nIt has only been a month since they started talking (it also hurts that he hasn\u2019t told me or my husband yet - only his other brother and my SIL), so nothing is set in stone but just thinking of this potential scenario is making me feel bad. I know I\u2019m just his brother\u2019s wife but we are all very close as a family but I can\u2019t help but worry about these things. AITA for feeling this way?"

For a bit of background, my partner and I live in two different cities and so we are only able to meet up maybe once or twice a week.

At the same time, one of our mutual friends messaged me to ask if I was interested in taking my partner's place since they had already purchased a ticket for her. I agreed and told my partner that I was going to see the movie with our friends. She then got extremely mad at me and said that had I told her earlier, she could have transited and made it in time for the movie as well. Now, the only way for her to make it in time would be for me to drive and pick her up. However, I reminded her that I initially didn't want to pick her up due to the distance between us as well as high gas prices. In the end, I went to the movie without her as I felt that it would have been a waste of a ticket and that my partner should have known how badly I wanted to watch the movie. Now that the movie is over, I have been trying to reach my partner but she has not read any of my messages.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?"

A shitload of gay porn, right there on the screen. I wasn't digging around his computer or anything, it was just there when i woke it up. Now my brother, as far as i knew, was straight. I took a picture with my phone, closed out and finished my work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n He got home from work later that evening and started telling me about how he was making out with a really cute girl from his summer job. Keep in mind at this point, i was livid. Here's this dude who i told every single secret too, and expected the same, yet he hid this from me. Granted we live in an area that isn't super LGBT friendly, but me and him both hold fairly liberal views, my philosophy is that you fuck whoever you wanna fuck, as long as it's alive and consensual. Anyways, he starts talking, i shut the door and pull up the picture on my phone. I tell him \"wtf dude, i thought we told eachother everything.\" His face went completely white and he silently just walked out of the room and ran out of the house. He came back a couple hours later. I confronted him again, saying that i felt betrayed that he would keep such a stupid secret from me. He exploded at me, telling me i embarrassed him, outed him, and totally invaded his privacy. It was only us two in the room, i haven't told anyone else, nor do i plan to. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr, accidentially found out my brother is gay, i confronted him and now he's mad because i found out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso for the record in case you skipped it, no i don't have a problem with him being gay.

Not necessarily flirt back, just don't yank yourself away from him.\n\nGrowing up, I was ways compared to my step-cousin.

Add to that my half siblings really hated me for what our mom had done and did not like when they came to mom's and had to see me. Then there was my mom's parents who favored them because they loved my siblings dad more than mom, their daughter, because she had fucked them over too.\n\nSo I grew up basically nobody wanting me. I had a couple of friends. But I struggled to make and maintain relationships and it took a lot of therapy for me to be okay. And I won't lie I probably still don't have the best idea of healthy relationships and still crave a family. But I'll probably never get to be that lucky. And that's despite my boyfriend being great and me having him as a support system along with some friends.\n\nThree weeks ago I found out one of the boyfriends died and my mom was torn up about it. I ended up showing up to confront her because when I had tried to let it all out to her before, she had blocked me on social media and refused to answer the door to me or shut me down when I was still a minor living with her. So I dumped it all out. That she had fucked me up and chose men over me, chose to be with men who didn't want a thing to do with me, and who never gave me the love I deserved as a kid. I felt so much better afterward. It was like I could finally let it all out and move on. But my mom's parents and even some of my half siblings said I was an AH, via social media, the half siblings had previously blocked me, grandparents just never accepted me on there. And now I'm wondering if I am TA for what I did.\n\nAITA?"

She ist 18 and isn't even allowed to leave the house without there permission. Anna has another friend lets call her Emily. They have been friends for about 2 years but have never met. Emily and I became friends about 7 months ago.\n\n All of my interactions with Anna and Emily are over Skype because Anna isn't allowed to leave the house and Emily lives about 5 hours away. We Skype together all the time, but the other day Anna couldn't join us because her family was visiting. \n\nSo Emily and I Skyped alone. We are very similar people especially in terms of spontaneously doing things. We both don't work this August so we had the idea to go on vacation together. 3 hours later we had booked our flight and hotel in Venice, Italy. We were really excited and told Anna when she joined us after her visitors left.\n\n She wasn't. She cried and hung up. Look the thing is I love Anna but I don't wanna spend every day in my room because she has to.  I understand that she is upset that we go on vacation without her because she has been friends with us individually longer and we are Basically a trio but I don't wanna miss out on this experience because her parents don't allow her to go to. She asked us to cancel it and wait until next year so we can all go together because she hopes her parents let her do more when she is 19. We have already paid our flights and hotel we would lose a ton of money. \n\nI don't she is entitled to ask us to do this. Now she says I'm an Asshole, am I?"

She\u2019s a fun person to hang out with, so I just accepted it as one her many quirks.\n\nHowever, within the past eight weeks or so, the smell has become much worse. It\u2019s an intense, musty odor that fills whatever small space we\u2019re in and sticks to any cloth she comes into contact with. For example if Addy sat on my bed, I\u2019ll have to strip the sheets to wash after she leaves, or the smell will stay in the room.\n\nThe last time she came over, my housemates complained that the smell drifted all the way downstairs from my room. Now that Addy\u2019s problem is affecting the other people in my life, I have to acknowledge it.\n\nBecause the issue got worse within the past few months, it could be signs of a health issue (physical or mental.) I don\u2019t know how I could ever bring up the smell with Addy herself. How can you broach a subject like that without utterly embarrassing the person? \n\nSo the asshole part: months ago, before the smell got worse, I invited Addy to a party I\u2019m hosting. Now I\u2019m concerned that her hygiene issues will impact the enjoyment of my other guests. Do I lie and tell her it\u2019s cancelled/postponed and still hold it for my other friends? Or do I address the issue directly?"

            "text": "I (18M) pull in a decent amount of money (full-time day trading). It's drops in the bucket compared to what my parents make, but it is very good for an 18 year old. Recently we moved states, but are staying in a rental until our new house is fully built. This rental is pretty small, but it had a basement that had to be rented separately (I guess the owner will sometimes rent it out to other guests, but it wasn't being rented at this time). Anyways, I brought this up to my dad, and said I could move down there and it would give us way more space in this tiny rental.\n\nHe agrees, the renter said we could have it for 500 bucks for the duration of our stay. My parents say that if I want to use it, I will have to pay the 500. No big deal, I pay it, and now I have a basement to myself for the summer. They know I make good money, not exactly how much though. They also make good money, so 500 wouldn't have been a problem for them, but at the same time I have always kind of payed for stuff (gas, food, car payments and insurance) because they believe I have the means to do so.\n\nFast forward a little bit, this past week my parents brought up going to see my grandparents, who are now way closer because we have just moved one state away from them. This would probably be a 2 day trip, drive up one day, visit, stay the night, drive back the next. Now I was more than happy to see my grandparents, and I mentioned doing it on the 4th of July, and driving back the 5th (markets are closed the day after 4th of July). This however doesn't work as the care facility my grandmother is in would be closed on both the 4th and the 5th. They then say we can just go up on that Thursday. Now, I know it is my grandparents, but if I am now effectively paying rent at this place, in addition to all the other expenses I cover myself, then I feel like my work deserves the slightest respect to not just get a day trip thrown at it, especially on an already shortened week for the markets. I suggested we just go up that weekend, but apparently that doesn't work as they have already made plans to go visit some other friends those days.\n\nMy mom is calling me selfish, and saying I don't want to see my grandparents. Obviously I want to see them, but I have a job. I have to work, just like any other 9-5 job. On top of that, if they are gonna have me pay for stuff on my own, then shouldn't I be allowed to work? Not to mention the fact that we are now just 2 hours away from them, and can literally go and visit any other weekend, or if I was given advanced notice, sometime during the week would work too.\n\nI may be the asshole because I think I come across as not wanting to see my grandparents, and being to involved with my work.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR: Parents want me (18M) to drop my work to see my grandma after making me pay for stuff that I arguably don't need to be paying for."

We hangout regularly but my wife is not fond of my best friend\u2019s hubby  sometimes when we are going out I will get exited and invite them to come with us. Im a very social person and I enjoy having someone else to hang with specially my bestie. I also feel bad not inviting them as they try to include us in everything. My wife is a bit less social and she has complained in the past that if we are going out for a hike together she doesn\u2019t want me to invite them to come along. She feels like the hubby talks too much complains when he gets tired and is always asking stupid questions (this is true) but it doesn\u2019t really bother me that much! I love spending time with my wife but i do enjoy others ppl company. Thing is we are going to see my brother in law next weekend he lives a few hours away in a pretty remote place that my friend and his partner want to visit (they have mentioned it) I figured that since we were gonna go see my brother in law it wasn\u2019t really an US thing and so when they asked about our plans I said we were going there and that they could come and rent a place close by. After we left my wife got bothered and told me to consult with her before inviting, I said I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal cause the biL was gonna be there too. She said it bothered her cause they drain her and that she is sorry she \u201cis so boring I need other people\u201d. That kind of bothered me cause we are together all the time! We go out together and hang @home together. I do like to include other people cause I like to socialize specially if we are double dating. I told her to stop victimizing herself and she said I was making her feel bad about her personality. I don\u2019t want my wife to be unhappy but she doesn\u2019t wanna meet any other people or hang out with my friends and I love hanging with other people. I don\u2019t want to leave her and go on my own cause I love to hang with her too. Aita for inviting others? Should I apologize and ask every-time before inviting others? I knew she wasn\u2019t a very social person but she knew i was super social. She is now upset at me and I know even tho she is meal prepping for me. She is amazing on everything and we dont have any other problems. Im I on the wrong?"

For context, this is in an extremely fast-paced laboratory environment with little-to-no room for mistakes/failures, etc at an Ivy League institute. \nComing into this job, I was the underdog: I was the only one there who did not come from another high-ranking institution previously. Most of the people in this lab have much more experience than me and also came from Yale, Harvard, Emory, etc. \nI got the job and I\u2019m confident in my ability to learn quickly, but I\u2019m definitely not at the level of most other people I work with.\n\nFast forward to my first week: I meet my mentor and he is not enthusiastic about having me there. The girl\u2014let\u2019s call her J\u2014who I was essentially replacing is leaving in 2 weeks. My mentor was busy with another project when I was hired, so he basically sticks me with J and turns me into her shadow. J was clearly annoyed to take me on as a student, and it was never her job to do so. She doesn\u2019t enjoy teaching me and she is kind of short tempered and snappy with me. \n\nThe next two weeks are hell. J is annoyed at me for every little thing because she wasn\u2019t interested in teaching me. She glosses over things, speeds through, doesn\u2019t allow me to ask questions and then reports back to my mentor that she \u201calready taught me\u201d something. When I\u2019m asked to do the task in front of my mentor, I obviously don\u2019t know how to do it because I was hardly taught. He gets angry with me and praises J for being so amazing at the job, and then proceeds to ask me why I\u2019m not like J. \n\nIn the end I had so much animosity towards J not only for how she treated me, but for the way my mentor wouldn\u2019t constantly compare me to her, praise her, etc. when she had so much more experience than me. \n\nBy the end I was clearly avoiding working with her and I did not appreciate the mentor pitting us against each other with the constant comparisons and berating me. \n\nSo AITA for avoiding her in the end until she left because of the way I was pit against her?\n\nTLDR: my mentor was too lazy to train me himself so he placed me with his other student and made us compete."

Usually when you sit down to eat you pay at the end.

Meanwhile her son came out and offered use fortune cookies, not saying a word mind you, and bowed silently as my mom and his talked.

The way the school system works( IB) is that they're part of a 2 year course, and they have various projects over the summer holidays. Right now, he has to plan and complete a project for Business, Biology, maths, and Chemistry. He also has an overarching project called the Extended Essay, which is essentially a research project or something like a thesis paper. I'm not exactly sure how to explain it, but it is a big part of his grade. \n\nHe also did not do very well during exams, and has fallen behind in several subjects. As such, we have gotten him 2 tutors to help improve his grades. He is going for maths tuition 3 times a week, Chemistry tuition 4 times a week, as those are the high risk subjects. He is also working on all of said projects and gets a decent bit of homework from these teachers. Needless to say, he does not have a lot of free time, and this is pretty much his last real holiday, because after this, he is going to have to spend most of his holidays prepping for his board exams in a year. \n\nHe pretty much gets 5-6 hours of free time a day, but he also has to help around the house, due to my health complications. In short, he doesn't have much free time and he's getting really grumpy because of it. He's been asking me and his dad for a break, as he \"already is halfway through his holidays and pretty much has had 0 fun\". He wants at least a week where he doesn't have to work and just wants to have fun, and laze around. Thing is that this is not feasible. He needs to work and needs to catch up. This is his last year of school and his last chance to get into a good college like he wants. I've told him that he has no choice but to power through. He's been pissed off at us and stomping around the house since. \n\nI do feel bad, because it really is his last holiday and after this it's gonna be work, work and work. Truth is that he has no choice, he needs to study and work on his projects. He's obviously been taking snide shots at me since then as well, which is not helping me at all. \n\nAITA?"

I had broken up a relationship at the time and was jobless. My parents allowed me to come back even tho they would have preferred I find my own place so I can \u201cgrow up.\u201d It's not an ideal situation for me to be here either at this age.\n\nI worked from Feb 2021 - May 2021 then got laid off. I paid rent here from Feb - July even tho my parents said not to but I compensated them anyways because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I injured my knee right after I got laid off and have arthritis on both my wrists so I haven\u2019t looked for a job yet but I will ASAP once my knee has been cleared by the doctor. I can't WFH because desk jobs hurt my wrists &amp; WFH never worked out well for me. I need to find something in-person but can't right now because of my leg.\n\nMy brother and his GF have been together for a while since sophomore year of high school. My brother has to wait until next year to get into nursing school and his GF is still at university for another 1.5 yrs.\n\nBefore I moved in, I did hear that the GF was over all the time but didn\u2019t think much of it as I had my own stuff to worry about &amp; since I didn\u2019t experience it first hand I didn\u2019t know what I would be feeling. I have always been bothered by the frequency &amp; duration of her visits but it only became excessive for me recently. Also, since I was unemployed when I first got here and my bro helped me move back, I just said I'll deal with it for now.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the reasons why I've gotten increasingly annoyed:\n\n\\- She visits majority of the week. Rarely is she not here.\n\n\\- Her visits can be 12+ hours sometimes. Sometimes she's here the whole 12 hours.\n\n\\- She parks in the driveway (my parent's permit this). But I think it's rude when my dad is a 100% disabled veteran, my mom breaks her back daily at her nursing job working 6 days a week, and I have an injured knee. I had to park on the street once cos her car was parked in the driveway! I know my parent's have final say, but I think it's just so damn rude to park at someones house when you don't live there! \n\nThey can't go to her place to hang out because her mom is supposedly super strict &amp; doesn't know about my brother dating her even though its been years. I don't know in what ways the mom is 'strict' but I do believe it because the GF will go to great lengths to lie about where she is and her dad will cover up for her. My issue is that, while it's not the GF's fault for having an unwelcoming home, GF is placing that burden on me by being here all day everyday.\n\nI understand that if I don't like things, I can find my own place but I still legally and rightfully live here and so my issue is that as a resident of this household, I believe I am entitled to some damn space and privacy without having to be shoved into my room to get it.\n\nWho is the AH?

My next-door neighbor and I quickly got to know each other pretty well and became good friends. In February of 2020 he mentioned how his parents (who lived halfway across the country) were going to be visiting in a few weeks, but the quarantine happened which put the idea on hold for the meantime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to 1-2 weeks ago. My neighbor told me his parents had been vaccinated and were coming to visit in a week. He told me about how his parents were very old-fashioned racists, and how the last time they had come to visit they had gotten into an argument with the African-American family who used to live at my house before I moved in, which had involved the police being called and him forcing them to leave. (FYI him and his family is Caucasian while I am African-American). He said they lived in a pretty much exclusively white neighborhood full of other white people who shared their views. He had cut them off for multiple years prior to 2020 but since they were both getting old (80+), and his dad was diagnosed with some form of cancer in late 2019, he tried to get them to visit one last time. He told me he knew they were racist pieces of shit, but he just wanted to see the parents that had loved for and cared for him for all those years, and that he wanted to simply ignore their bad side only for a little bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, if they saw me going about, they would undoubtedly cause a scene. To try and avoid this, he had told them that all his current neighbors were white (which is true besides me), and he would try and contain them indoors as much as possible. He asked me if I could do him a favor and keep myself scarce while they were around. He reassured me that he would back me up if something happened and that he wasn't forcing me to do anything. I was willing to help him out though so I agreed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo days ago was when his parents arrived. I pretty much did as he asked, only going outside once and I had texted him to make sure his parents weren't in range. Yesterday, however, my friend (who is also African-American) called me to come visit. I told him it wasn't a good time and explained the situation. He seemed to understand and said he wouldn't come. But a few hours later, I heard arguing outside. My friend had decided that he wouldn't \"allow some racist old assholes to decide where he could and couldn't go\", and came despite my wishes for him not to. My neighbor's parents were outside at the time and instigated an argument. I was mad at my friend and told him to leave, which he did. For the next 2-3 hours I could hear my neighbor and his parents shouting at each other, which resulted in them leaving shortly after. I texted my neighbor to apologize but he assured me it wasn't my fault. I'm still mad at the friend who decided to come visit despite my wishes not to, who says I'm being an asshole about the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?"

She was visiting from overseas and right now our family here is working to send her body back to her home country for burial.  Everybody is shaken over this as the manner in which she died was both sudden and traumatic.\n\nI've been helping my parents by going through Ariel's things and arranging for her body to be cleared to be sent back.  I was on her laptop the other day when I discovered that Ariel had never logged out of her social media accounts.  So basically I have full access to her facebook, instagram, tumblr, you get the picture.\n\nBefore I tell you what I found on her tumblr, I need to tell you what my cousin was like.  Ariel was a hardcore tomboy.  She loved to work out, ran several marathons, and had served in her country's military.  She barely wore makeup, and I maybe saw her in a dress once or twice.  She liked action, fantasy, and comedy movies.  And she was kind of a jerk, she liked to make fun of me for liking Supernatural.  She was visibly bored when our aunts talked 'Bachelor' gossip.  And once said that \"shipping is for chumps.\"  She was the least romantic person I know.  My other cousins liken her to Rosa Diaz.  \n\nSo color me surprised when I found her secret fanfic account Tumblr.  Not Supernatural.  It turns out Ariel was STILL obsessed with Harry Potter.  Or what looks to be Harry Potter-related stuff.  I am not familiar with the characters she liked to post about.  But a lot of the stuff on her blog (aside from her cosplay pics, which is how I figured out this was really her blog) shipping fics.  There was a lot of fics and fanart she reblogged, as well as some stuff she came up with as well.  But most of it was shipping.  \n\nAnd this is from the cousin who said \"shipping is for chumps\" and refused to get married.  \n\nWIBTA if I shared Ariel's secret fanfic account to the rest of the family?  It may help us heal from her death and get us to better understand her better.  But mostly we found find it hilarious that our cousin, who was basically Artemis or Atalanta incarnate and hated dating and anything super \"girly\" would go crazy over something called 'Newtina'.  Just the fact she was obsessed with this pairing makes her softer after death, like I never expected this out of her.  \n\nI'm just asking because no one in my family is in the right headspace right now and I need a more sound mind to help us out.\n\nWIBTA anyway?"

            "text": "I(19f) live with my mom(38).My freshman year of high school we wear asked to make a \u201cgame plan\u201d for our life.Mine:Military,college,start my own business.I am class of \u201921, I dropped out of high school in Feb after being told I wouldn\u2019t have enough credits to graduate with my class.I enrolled in my towns GED program(May) and was done on June 7th.My mom made it known that she thought getting my GED was settling even though she helped my older cousin get his.I told her the plan was to go to the military so I wouldn\u2019t have to go into debt paying for college.I talked to a recruiter in June but I didn\u2019t have all my documents so I couldn\u2019t enlist at the time.I\u2019m doing everything I can to fix the issue and currently trying to lose weight so I can enlist.Every since I dropped out my mom has been rushing me to do something so she can move out of our state.She said she wouldn\u2019t pay rent after june, so I asked her to tell our landlord shes moving out and I\u2019d move 2 of my friends in.The plan was that the 3 of us would split rent because we all had jobs, we fully discussed everything down to how we\u2019d buy groceries and do chores.She said I could just keep everything in her name to skip all the paperwork but I said no because we were each going to have a certain bill to our name to build our credit.She then decided that she didn\u2019t want to do that.Now she\u2019s saying that shes plans on being gone by the end of the year.I\u2019m no longer working, my friends have moved, so theres no way for me to pay the rent.She knows why I haven\u2019t been able enlist yet but she\u2019s completely ignoring it.Every time we talk she says \u201cyou need to decide what youre going to do because I refuse to be stuck here.College or the military, you need to hurry up.\u201dI explain the situation every time and she acts like im doing this on purpose. I feel like im holding her back but theres nothing I can do.I already missed the deadlines for college admissions and my recruiter says I cant do anything without all my documents.Ive started doing things to earn money so I can pay her back but nothing is enough.Anytime we talk I sink deeper into my depression because I know she hates it here but it feels like she stopped supporting me/caring the minute I dropped out.We\u2019ve had many arguments about me feeling like she doesn\u2019t care anymore, she says im overreacting. Am I the AH for sticking to my life plan/ holding my mom back?"

            "text": "So I (23) just had an argument with my step mom over telling me I need to wear a hat while out on her bike at the woods with my mum and brother. \n\nSo yesterday I asked if I could borrow her bike to use at the woods today so I could spend some time with my mom and younger brother, she said this was fine. I woke up this morning and she said that I need to pump the tyres up which is fair enough, so I agreed to do it before I went. Then she said that I need to wear a hat, I replied something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ll decide when I get there\u201d. Obviously if I was riding on the road I would wear a hat 100% of the time, but we are only riding through the woods. The reason I pushed back on this is because I felt like it was being pushed on me and I feel like it\u2019s only natural to push back a little when people try to tell you what to do. She also said that it is her bike, which I replied I\u2019m not sure that has to do anything to do with whether I wear a hat or not (I know that she was only looking out for my safety and I understand that, but the way it was said I felt that she was being a bit of a tyrant about it. She then replied something like \u201cdont\n be stupid\u201d and claimed that I wouldn\u2019t exactly be going slow, to which I said that I wouldn\u2019t be going that fast (I\u2019m not going to go that fast haha)\n\nSo the argument escalated a little and I said that she was just on a power trip. This really annoyed her and she stormed off downstairs. \n\nI went down and said very calmly \u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind of reaction you expected when you are trying to force me to do something\u201d. She then reacted (very annoyed) and said \u201cwell I dont know what kind of reaction you expected when you are name calling\u201d (saying she was on a power trip), which I said never happened because that is not name calling.\n\nI said that I needed to be trusted to make my own choices and when I feel like someone is forcing me to make a choice, I\u2019m going to push back a little. My dad and her say that I take things in the \u201cwrong\u201d way and she said she shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cfluff things up to a 23 year old\u201d. So AITA here for telling her that she was on a power trip?"

Throwaway cos i know she's on reddit.\n\nSo, my (18m) friend 'M' (17m) got a girlfriend 'Z' a few months back (17f) and he seems really happy with her, which is great, im glad he's happy especially cos its his first relationship. Our group of friends has met her once very briefly, she seems nice but she's super quiet. My gf is good friends with her and said that she's just shy around new people but eventually she gets more talkative.\n\nNow, us guys were gonna have a party next week and usually when we do this stuff the guys bring their girlfriends if they want, no one minds. We all get along. M was planning on bringing Z, but here's my thing. I know Z probably wouldn't have a good time cos she's so quiet and doesn't talk much, she doesn't really know us so what's the point of her coming if she's only gonna hang around the people she knows? She doesn't drink either so it might be weird if we're all drinking and she isnt. Also i want M to have a good time too, not be stuck with her all night. Another thing; the guys that bring their gf's to these parties, we've met them before heaps of times and they've all been together a lot longer then 3 or 4 months like M and Z.\n\nSo i messaged M and asked if maybe he could not bring Z to the party, she probably wouldn't be comfortable cos she doesn't have the same vibe as us and maybe Z can come to the next one when she knows us more. We had a bit of an argument about it but eventually he said he'd talk to her. Dunno how that went but he said she is gonna give this one a miss. I feel like M is annoyed at me but I don't think im in the wrong here, just making sure everyones gonna have a good time and idk how she would have fun when she doesn't seem comfortable with us yet.

            "text": "Some other posts reminded me of this. It happened about a year ago and I have had no contact with my ex friend since then.\n\nMy friend had to go abroad for a year for work and asked me to take care of his two cats for him. I agreed because I like cats and before he left I calculated how much they would cost in food, kitty litter, and regular medication, but didn't ask him for anything for their care. I showed the calculations to my friend and expected him to transfer the amount on a monthly basis. This didn't happen and he only transferred money once when I contacted him because one if the cats needed surgery and once more when I reminded him. After that I gave up asking him for money for the cats and just paid for everything myself, even when the costs for various reasons ended up exceeding my monthly calculations.\n\nAfter one year had passed, I was informed that his stay had been extended another year and I kept taking care of the cats without complaints, but when he finally returned home after two years, he didn't come pick them up. The reason was that he had no stable housing and his cats didn't get along with his grandmother's dog (se mainly lived with his grandmother). During this time, he did occasionally give me some money for cat food, but still nowhere close to the actual costs. I didn't press the issue and pretty much considered them my cats now because it had been years and he showed no signs of wanting them back.\n\nThen I started hearing from mutual friends that he was complaining about me behind my back. Saying things like that I stole his cats and he can't take them back because my family loves them so much and also claiming that I have been exaggerating the amounts that the cats have cost and trying to rip him off. I saw actual screenshots of these conversations.\n\nShortly afterwards, he finally got his own apartment and I of course offered to give him his \"stolen\" cats back. He told me that he wasn't allowed to keep pets in his apartment, but was going to find them another home so that they wouldn't bother me anymore. At this point, I told him that they of course could stay at my house, but he ignored this. During the following couple of weeks, he kept saying things about me behind my back (this time about how awful I was for wanting to dump the cats off at his apartment when I knew he wasn't allowed to keep pets), while saying something completely different to my face. I got tired of this and just brought the cats over to him (with his permission) and left.\n\nNow, the cats most likely had a much better life at my place with a lot more space, better food, better care overall (my friend didn't keep the litter boxes in good condition) and actual veterinary check-ups. He clearly didn't want the cats back despite what he was saying to my face. Was I an asshole for still bringing them back to him?"

            "text": "We live together - I'm trying to get back on my feet again after losing my job during coronavirus, and knew that this would be a rough adjustment. We have a complicated past relationship - let's just say he was a terrible and neglectful father figure, and is as a result estranged from my other siblings and most of his own family as a result. I've been in limited contact with him since leaving home, but it's increased since the pandemic screwed us all.\n\nOur apartment is comfortable enough, but our domestic conflicts are getting to a point where I may have to do something drastic to make him listen to me.\n\nI happen to be extremely neurotic about the way I like to keep my kitchen. (I happen to work in one and the habits have carried over.) I want the dishes and silverware rotated, I want the dishwasher loaded in a certain way, and I want everything put back in its exact place. I also do an extremely thorough job cleaning around the sink every single time I do any light work there.\n\nBecause I don't expect my messier father to do anything like this, I've asked him to please not touch anything in the kitchen when it comes to cleaning - don't handwash anything, don't put anything away, don't do jack squat, just leave anything you dirty in the sink. I'll do every last dish even after coming home from a nine-hour shift. In exchange, he can mop, sweep, and vacuum the place once a week, and we're even on housework.\n\nHe continuously doesn't honor this, and when I go to get dishes, I can tell he's quietly washed a few things and put them back without rotating them. He always puts back pots and pans in the wrong place, and I struggle to find them - much of the time they've been haphazardly washed and dried, too, and I'll have to give them a final rinse, or even a light second wash, because of his shoddy excuse for work. He seems to think I'm going to thank him for \"pulling his weight\", when he's a laughably horrible housekeeper that would get fired in a second working back-of-house anywhere.\n\nI, to be frank, don't think he is trying to sincerely help out. I think he neither wants to do dishes nor clean the house regularly, and thinks that if he doesn't do the latter, he might be able to squeak by with me if he takes away some of my workload by doing a dish or two.  I view this as pretty open disrespect - like what I'm asking him is some kind of suggestion that I'm just going to give up on eventually.\n\nWe had a huge fight last week, and I'm kind of living in fear of the next confrontation. I'm considering threatening to move out as the next step - or threatening to quit my job so that we're hurt financially and in danger of getting evicted. We're living on the edge as it is.\n\nI just don't understand what his problem is. I established accommodating ground rules most roommates would be happy about.  Am I just too uptight for my own good here?  AITA?"

            "text": "\nI feel bad about this, but at the same time, grading diamonds doesn't shape up when our family includes doctors, inventors, professors, and a former NASA employee.\n\nMy sister Queenie (not her real name) and I come from a STEM-heavy family.  Almost everybody went into the sciences.  Name any branch and I can direct you to the parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, cousin, or grandparent who was involved in that field.  \n\nExcept Queenie.  I hate to say this, because she is intelligent, brilliant and creative in so many ways, but she struggled with science and math in school.  She is brilliant at art and English.  So our parents encouraged her to go for an arts degree where she would thrive instead of a science degree, where she would have floundered.  And she graduated with honors.  We just didn't realize that getting a job with an English degree would be hard.  We were still proud of her when she got a job in the jewelry industry.\n\nBut I think she always struggled with being the \"black sheep\" of our family and being the only one without a career in science.  Especially last year or whenever everybody was talking about what their work was doing at Thanksgiving.  \n\nWell, in the last year Queenie enrolled in some courses and became a certified gemologist.  I'm really proud of her for this.  Her self-esteem has really improved since she got certified.  \n\nAnd here's the part where maybe I should have kept my big fat mouth shut.  \n\nWe were having dinner at our folks place the other night.  Queenie and I were on the porch with beer and shooting the shit.  She was gushing about her new work as a gemologist when she brought up how accomplished she feels and is comparable to everybody else in the family now as a \"woman in STEM.\"  \n\nI respectfully disagreed with her on the 'woman of STEM' part because gemology isn't really a science.  Queenie's job now includes conducting quality control on her company's diamond stock in addition to selling the finished pieces.  Her certification wasn't as involved or as intense as what most of us went through, which included years of graduate school on top of internships and research expeditions.  There's not much of a science on determining if a diamond is good enough to place in a brooch.  Not when our cousins include doctors, nurses, researchers, chemists, and even an engineer for Tesla!\n\nLong story short, Queenie is now furious with me and refuses to even look at me anymore.  My parents are also pissed at me, though most of the extended family does think that gemology isn't a true scientific field.  Her job is selling finished, finely cut over priced minerals to a clientele that believes in the deBeers lie.\n\nTo me, gemology isn't really a legit scientific field.  It's more akin to analyzing properties in crystals and gemstones to determine if it can be sold for thousands of dollars.  It's like our crazy \"astrologer\" aunt who sells natal charts as a side hustle.  AITA?"

Right before I left I sneezed maybe ten times because sometimes I induced myself into sneezing to clear up my nasal passages. Then I blew my nose, grabbed my keys and left through the side door. There\u2019s a light on the stairs that allows me to see the steps right before you go out the side door so I turned it on, and left it on bc I wanted to be able to see where I\u2019m going upon my return.

Before my wedding I booked a bachelorette weekend with Jen and my 4 other bridesmaids (18-35F) which cost about $200 each. Cost was raised as an issue but everyone agreed to save up for a few months and said that it would be fine.\n\nAbout a month before the bachelorette Jen's sister (45F) got a cancer diagnosis and was given only a few weeks to live. Obviously I was sympathetic to this. It threw a lot of the plans off as I had to rearrange all of the bridesmaid dress fittings and there was one occasion where Jen cancelled on the morning of the fitting which screwed up everyone else's schedule. Her reasoning was that her sister could die any day and so she wanted to be within driving distance of the hospital and my fittings were taking place about an hour away. I eventually had to just get her to take her own measurements.\n\nTwo days before the bachelorette party, Jen pulled out. She said she didn't feel comfortable going on a weekend away when her sister might die. I didn't argue it because I thought that was fair, I couldn't really argue that she should leave her sister. The rest of us all went and had a good time. Jen's sister did sadly pass away a few days later.\n\nOn my wedding day a few months later Jen was acting really weird. She didn't speak to me and was very grouchy. Eventually she left the wedding early without even saying goodbye. I asked another bridesmaid what was going on and she said that Jen didn't feel that I had been supportive of her by 'hassling' her about attending bridesmaid fittings while her sister was dying and texting her too much about the wedding, even though I only did that because it was imminent. Another example the bridesmaid gave was that I didn't offer to give Jen her $200 back for the bachelorette she couldn't attend. I was surprised to hear that this was an issue. My reasoning was that if Jen got her money back then either me or everyone else would need to pay extra to cover it which seemed unfair when it was no-one else's fault that Jen couldn't go.\n\nI haven't spoken to Jen in 3 years since the wedding and sometimes I wonder if I should have just given her the money back."

After graduating I left to go to another city and he followed me, ending his college coaching career (wasn\u2019t possible for him to find another coaching job of that caliber nearby). While I did my residency in this city, he decided to go to law school (we were in a large city with lots of law schools) and I finished my residency at the exact same time he graduated. I had to go to another city to do a fellowship and he decided to follow me again and get licensed in that state. While I did my fellowship, he got a (in his words, super boring) job. My fellowship ended and I got an offer in another city (same state though) and we decided to move again for my career. My (now husband) quit his job and looked for several months after moving until he finally found another position. He doesn\u2019t love what he does, but he said it\u2019s much better than his first job and it pays pretty well. Recently, I got an offer in another city (different state) that is basically my dream job. I feel like I\u2019ve been working my entire life for this ultimate end goal job. I asked my husband about it and he said flat out no. He said he sacrificed his dream job (college coaching) for my career and has just now begun to establish his legal career. He also said he doesn\u2019t want to take another bar exam. I pointed out that this is my dream job and that he\u2019s still early in his career and can work towards those career goals in that new city (which is bigger anyway). He told me I was being selfish and that he had sacrificed enough for me and that it was my turn. He\u2019s refused to talk to me since then. AITA for asking him to move?

The only thing we're allowed to do is exercise outdoors, as long as we stay within 5km of our home. \n\nThe closest park to me is a dog park (essentially a big field ringed by a fence), which is great because my toddler absolutely ADORES dogs. He knows how to approach a dog and be friendly, and doesn't mind when a doggie bowls him over in excitement. We will take a walk  there twice a week so he can run off some energy. \n\nHe is also currently obsessed with golf. We bought him a little plastic golf set, and it comes with these small plastic golf balls. \n\nYesterday we went to the dog park and he carried his golf club and small ball with him. Once we got to the park, he proceeded to putt the ball around, taking the occasional break to Pat any dogs that came up to us. \n\nA small dog (it looked like a cocker spaniel I think) ran up to us and after getting a pat, picked up my toddlers golf ball and legged it. The owner who had been watching from a distance (we were all socially distancing) freaked out and ran after it. I ran too to catch up to her in case she needed any help. Both my toddler and the dog seemed to think this was hilarious, and everyone was just running around for a bit. Eventually the spaniel dropped the ball, and the owner of the dog picked it up. \n\nI ran up to her laughing thinking she might find it funny too, but she was fuming. She held onto the ball and told me it was irresponsible to bring such a small thing to a dog park. She said her dog could have swallowed it, and she would have sued me for the cost of getting it out. I apologised (I have a small child - I know the anxiety of something dumb and lovable trying to swallow dangerous things) and opened my hand to get the ball back. But she kept getting more and more upset, saying that if I didn't have a dog that I wasn't allowed to even come to the park. \n\nI think I apologised again and asked for the ball back. She didn't seem to hear me, so I finally said in a raised voice: Give me the ball back, PLEASE. She told me I was being rude, lobbed the ball in the direction of my toddler (I don't think she was trying to hit him), leashed her dog and walked off. \n\nSo AITA for bringing a small ball to the dog park? And do dog owners think it's an AH thing to come to a dog park when you have no dog? I'll stick to tennis balls from now on, because I'm pretty sure they're harder to swallow."

Me and my dad both wear this to go out to airsoft I have removed all things that said U.S. military or something to that effect from them since their not really supposed to have that anyways. \n\nHere's the issue when we go to games we get dressed at home and start the 1-2 hour drive to the field. We usually stop at like walmart or kum&amp;go and pick up something to drink or eat. I typically wear a white tshirt under my UCP so I'll take off the top part when we go into places but I cant really take off my pants my dad just wears the full thing in. We've had multiple people come up and thank us for our service when we haven't served at all which makes me really uncomfortable beacause I dont deserve to be thanked for something I never did especially something like that. The first time I tried to say that we weren't service members and that we we're going to airsoft when my dad interrupted me. Once we got to the car he explained that I shouldn't do that beacause it just complicates things.\n\nThe other thing that makes me even more uncomfortable is when we get some form of discount we've never asked for one but sometimes they give it automatically. My dad's reasoning for why its okay is that he's a police officer and the places here would give us the same discount if he asked for it. I've all but given up trying to explain and correct people beacause when I do it irritates my dad but I dont think I should be accepting something that I dont deserve whether it be a thanks or a discount so reddit AITA?"

I'll most likely bring in over $100k gross this year. For background info my gf and I are saving up for a home at the moment, we have been together for a year currently. She just started being a nurse about 6 months ago and has 6 months left until she is able to travel nurse with me, and doesn't make quite a bit of money right now so it's rough on her to save money, but we should hopefully have enough for a sizeable down payment by the spring of next year. \n\nAnyways, I was telling her that I am putting so many miles on my brand new truck (60k in 18 months) and that I would like a second vehicle to drive around when I am home instead of racking on the miles on my truck like I have been doing. I would drive my truck to work and during the winter, and then my second vehicle while I am off work.

I do partially see where she is coming from, however, me purchasing this car would not impact my ability to save money for a home, I have a considerable amount put away right now and she knows that.

It somehow works out and I get reinvited into the presale.\n\nAbout a few hours before the presale, due to some technological problems, I don't have a cryptocurrency wallet ready to mint the NFTs. Friend 2, W, reaches out and says that he can lend me his one along with his 0.11ETH in it (350USD), but unfortunately, W doesn't have adequate capital, only having around two-thirds of the amount required to mint the two NFTs. So I cover the rest of the one-third needed to mint them. When the presale opens, the transaction was a success. Since the transaction was done under W's wallet, the NFT automatically goes under W's account on OpenSea, a marketplace for NFTs.\n\nNow after the release and the reveal of the NFTs to the public, the collection gains even more traction, and the reselling price skyrockets. Not having constant access to OpenSea, I ask Q and W to monitor the market instead, and they regularly report back to me about the situation. They say that my NFTs now have potential to sell for 4ETH (13000USD).\n\nThis is when Q and W both request a percentage cut of the profit that I make from the sale of my NFTs, which are stored on W's account at the time. Originally, we had talked about me lending them around 0.1 ETH as starting capital for their future NFT investments. However, they suggest a 10% cut each, since they say that they have helped me a lot during the process, and it wouldn't have been possible if I didn't have them by my side. I'm a little surprised that they even brought it up, seeing that they haven't said anything about it up until now, but their justification was that they were anxious about if I got angry at them for demanding such a large percentage cut from the profit.\n\nHearing that, I'm quite reluctant to give them a cut of my profit, but I was thinking if they ask again, I would give them both 0.1ETH each.\n\nWould that be an adequate payment?"

But I can't help but to be frustrated when there is something that is a problem for her very often, has been a problem for a long time, AND(not or) there is a very easy solution to it that we have discussed, but she instead continues to deal with the problem.\n\nIn summary, my girlfriend has a cat and he is picky about his food, as a result my girlfriend wastes money, food, and time for her solution to the cats pickiness(which is basically giving him a ton of different foods). I proposed an easy solution(which is basically giving him one food) but she is literally worried that her cat would starve himself to death. This worry of hers is the root cause of her problem, as if she didn't have this worry then she would apply the solution.\n\nI think that it's kinda ridiculous that she thinks her cat would literally starve himself to death even when given the option to eat. I'm frustrated because I care about her and don't like to see her have to deal with problems, and yet there is a very easy and simple solution to the problem she has to deal with.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I told her to stop complaining to me about her cat?"

            "text": "AITA for telling my friends that they need to do better being there. Some context here: my friend group consists of 4 people including myself. We all live 30-65 minutes away from each other. We all work and study full-time. 2/3 of us are married (including me). We mostly communicate via group chat. We are all impacted by the 7 week lockdown in NSW. I see them as my brothers as we have been friends for 4-7 years.\n\nSince the beginning of our friendship, I have always been the one to reach out, call, organise outings ect. Whenever I have done this its been hell organising as none of them can get their schedules straight. I almost always get met with \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d, \u201cSorry gonna cancel\u201d, \u201cnot bothered\u201d. I feel like no matter how hard I try to reach out (especially during the lockdown) I get shut down. This kinda feels unfair cause I\u2019m just as busy as the both of them but I still find time to reach out. I know that they don\u2019t prioritise me, however, when I mentioned this, they both got very defensive. \u201cYou could do better fitting your schedule to us!\u201d (I already have, as I am the one with the most flexible schedule) Or \u201cthat\u2019s super unfair to us, we have lives\u201d. I then told them to do better. I told them that its funny that I\u2019m just as busy, yet I make time for them - they did not like that. I suggested that maybe we can try syncing up our schedules or having zoom dates - especially since I hadn\u2019t seen them in person since MAY. Their responses to this were along the lines of: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna miss out on any shifts or change my availability cause I get paid\u201d, \u201cI need to study and work, I don\u2019t have time to zoom every week!\u201d. It\u2019s important to mention here that although I understand the importance of work and study, I don\u2019t believe I remotely suggested anything to do with that. I wasn\u2019t suggesting that they compromise their work hours for me. Rather, put effort in engaging in the friendship. It gets so very lonely holding up the friendship on my own.\n\nIt hurts to feel like I\u2019m the only one who values the relationship enough to want to put in effort or seek compromises. But I also feel like an ass for asking them to do better by trying to reach out - especially because I know how busy life gets.\n\nAITA?"

I feel like im holding her back but theres nothing I can do.I already missed the deadlines for college admissions and my recruiter says I cant do anything without all my documents.Ive started doing things to earn money so I can pay her back but nothing is enough.Anytime we talk I sink deeper into my depression because I know she hates it here but it feels like she stopped supporting me/caring the minute I dropped out.We\u2019ve had many arguments about me feeling like she doesn\u2019t care anymore, she says im overreacting.

His job was flexible, so he moved to my city after we started dating. In 2016, I got pregnant. Our relationship didn\u2019t last and we broke up when I was 4-5 months pregnant. We each had our own apartments in the same city. Evan got a better job in his old city when our daughter was 1.5 &amp; moved there, but he\u2019s always expressed wanting to transfer back here. I\u2019ve told him since I met him that I like where I live and I have no plans to move.   \n   \nTo make things worse, earlier this year Evan was accused of sexual harassment by someone he works with, so any plans to transfer within the company are completely halted while they investigate. He\u2019s currently working remotely with limited responsibilities and possibly reduced pay.   \n    \nFor the past 4 months, Evan has been dating someone new (I was relieved bc I\u2019ve had a bf for 3 years that Evan used to get upset about)and she has a daughter that\u2019s a year younger than our daughter. Now, Evan\u2019s lease is ending on his apartment this month and his job is in limbo. He believes he\u2019ll have his job fully back/his name cleared within the next 6 months. While all of that is being legally worked out, he has decided that moving in with his new girlfriend and her 3 year old will be a good idea. He\u2019s said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to pay $1200/month for his apartment and living with her is only temporary\u201d while he waits to see the future of his career. I should also note he\u2019s under contract so quitting the job outright is complicated.   \n    \nSo when he told me he\u2019s considering moving in with her and her kid, I told him I think it\u2019s a bad idea for a few reasons. The main reason I think it\u2019s a bad idea is because his own daughter only sees him 2x a month (about 6 days total per month) and it could hurt her to see that her dad is now living with this other child and that other child gets more \u201cdad time\u201d than she does. I also told him by living with this kid, he\u2019s going to have some kind of fatherly role and he\u2019s not going to easily be able to move without causing the girlfriend\u2019s kid pain. Moving in with your girlfriend and her child isn\u2019t something you just do temporarily then leave; this seems more long-term than he\u2019s admitting. I hurt for my daughter thinking how much it could affect her emotionally to realize not only has her dad not managed to live close to her in 3 years, but that he chose to live with another kid. When telling him this, he\u2019s saying I just don\u2019t want to see him happy and I\u2019m bringing him down when all he does is try to make our daughter happy.  \n    \nMaybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, because my own mom wasn\u2019t in my life at all, but raised two other kids. I was raised by my dad and step mom and I had a good childhood, but the realization that she \u201cpicked\u201d the other two kids over me really hurt."

Well tonight I was on a road, going 15 over when one lane merges into the next for about half a mile. No problem, there was one guy in front of me in the other lane. He was doing the speed limit, but when he realized I was going a little faster he matched my speed. Anyways, I\u2019m very self aware and knowing that I drive an SUV and he drives a compact, I gave him about 1 1/2 to 2 car lengths of space in the back so he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a prick. All is well until about a couple hundred feet away from the lanes opening up, he slows down to just below the speed limit right after he passes the sign. Kinda annoying, but I understand not everyone likes to speed so I slow down with him. As soon as the lane opens up I switch lanes, gas it a bit, and am going about 10 over. I look next to me and realize the car I was behind is gone. Weird, maybe it was a  gho-ohshithesrightbehindme. He was so close to the back of my car I couldn\u2019t even see the driver in the rear view mirror, just the top of his car. He\u2019s speeding with me, and just does that for the next mile or so until I get to my turn and he keeps going straight.\n\nI\u2019m guess I should mention I\u2019m  not very good with people in general, I never know how to act in social situations. Is 1 1/2-2 car lengths too little room? I\u2019m honestly at a lost for words. I thought I was being nice and not tailgating but I guess I\u2019m not sure. So AITA?"

I mostly do not give any because I don't have time and they do not like me that much because I am old and I mostly know what are they learning now via my residency training or invidiual sources but he tagged everyone so I looked to his proposal. It definitely was plagiarized from somewhere(it was a very high level study) and when I looked upon,I found an exact thesis from 1970s and everyone supported his study in the work group,I only said \"It needs better references.\" Next week,it was accepted in the board because no one would know a thesis from 1970s.

I\u2019m 34 weeks pregnant and also healthy. But, last night I was feeling particularly emotional and physically in pain from working ( I\u2019m wfh until my due date but my boss made me go in to make copies and that turned into a half day event). By the time I got home, I was exhausted and in need of a massage. My husband was on his way out to his mom\u2019s dinner and he was expecting me to meet him there. He was disappointed when i told him i wasn\u2019t going to go, but he understood. However, when I asked him to stay back for a half hour to give me a massage he got upset that I\u2019d make him late and in turn piss off his mom, on the day he\u2019s seeing her again for the first time since pre-pandemic. So i suggested i get a massage from our mutual friend (my best friend\u2019s  boyfriend) who is a massage therapist in training, but there\u2019s a tiny bit of history between us so my husband didn\u2019t like that either. So to quicken the recount: we argued, he ended up being late, and after his mom called and he blamed me for his being late which resulted in me getting lectured by his mom, I told him to stay home and take care of me or he\u2019d have to start paying his own phone bill ( I pay his). He did it but then slept on the couch that night. Didn\u2019t speak to me at all yesterday. And tonight when i returned from making more copies at the office he\u2019d claimed the bedroom, leaving my stuff for sleeping on the couch. About an hour before writing this, my SIL (30s) called and yelled at me for not letting my husband go to the dinner.

Awesome!\" Obviously a joke as well. I thought we were just making jokes.\n\nOutta the blue, she suddenly starts asking if I know the meaning of the word simp. I was kinda surprised. I told her her I wouldn't be using it if I didn't know the meaning. To my shock, she gets the screenshot for the dictionary meaning of simp and sends it to me. The meaning there was \"a stupid person\". I still didn't understand what she was tryna insinuate but I told her that wasn't what I meant. I showed the slang meaning but she kept insisting I insulted her. I asked how I was insulting her. All she said was \"never mind\" and she kept sulking over it. She kept saying I was defending myself instead of apologizing. And I'm like \"what are you talking about? I've told you what I meant. Did that offend you?\"\n\nShe really made a big issue over this. So I left a message for her telling her how she ruined my mood and how she's not giving any tangible reason for why she feels insulted. Honestly I feel ashamed that we're legit quarrelling over something this petty. She called this morning and I didn't pick to be honest. She then messaged me and began throwing tantrums again. I couldn't take it anymore so I told her in a voice notes that she was being senseless. I mean I was so frustrated!! How can someone act like a word has just one meaning? Stubbornly refusing to listen to me. So I lost my cool and I'm not proud of that. But she headed to her status to say \"Before dating someone, check their mental health. Moving on. Bye for life\". And she's obviously blocked me as well.\n\nI was shocked. I've tried calling her countless times. She's not picking. I've also sent her an SMS. No reply as well. She's giving me heartbreak right now honestly.\n\nAita?\n\nBtw if me and my gf don't communicate again, I guess I won't be dating till I'm done with school. I'm already feeling so sick \ud83d\ude2d. The fact that someone could throw away a relationship over some petty stuff."

So K and I grew up in what some might call \"ghetto\" it's a poor, rundown place but there are definitely worse neighborhoods. K was a bit more privileged than others because she lived with her poor grandma but got a lot of money from her dad to help them out. So we weren't exactly on the same financial wavelength. But we used to be in love with a show called \"My super sweet 16\", then also a movie called 16 wishes, and an episode of George Lopez where his daughter has a quince. Growing up, adults have promised us that this is something we would have. You would think it was our damn birth right with how set in stone they talked. But then we turned 13 and started asking about our quince. Her dad was putting off letting her plan anything and my parents had admitted they haven't saved anything. we were devastated but moved on because there was always 16. My parents scrambled together some money for a small sweet 16 done the Latino way when my aunts saw the budget, was appalled, and gave me more money to work with. so I had a decent-sized party and she was one of my dalmas. Her parents didn't want to do a sweet 16 because, pandemic, and her birthday was on the same day as a massive snowstorm anyway. I think all throughout her 15th year she was constantly thinking about it, but after my day, she got OBSESSED! I mean she cried everytime we drove past a quince boutique, cried when anything birthday related, and didn't even leave her bedroom on her birthday. But then K got a job, at first it was just about $400 every other week but her crew got a pay increase so now she gets like $750!!! so she's planning on a sweet 17 funded by her! with a $5000 budget, until her dad offered up $2500 and then her uncle who doesn't have children offered up the same amount! SO SHE WOULD HAVE A BUDGET OF $9500 which I told her is insane. but she brushed me off thinking I was just happy for her. but I'm not. She's wasting money, she's already sixteen, this is self absorbed and ridiculous. and I told her exactly that and she just stopped and stared at me. So I said \"I mean a Sweet 17? people are not gonna wanna show up for a birthday that's not even a milestone, just a makeup.\" Then she started crying, she was trying not to but I saw and she told me I should probably leave so I did.

The problem is that these guys make fun of me every chance they get, like saying I'm gay even though I told them I'm asexual and and them telling me I'm too fat to walk and them pulling pranks on me like throwing my notebooks into the trash. I'm fine with it because I know that friends are important and you\"ll have to deal with some of this to get into friend groups. \n\nBut, one time, F saw them pour water down my pants after school and he told them to fuck off and that they were assholes. They walked away without a word after which I told F that it was all in good fun and that he didn't need to do that. He said that was BS and that was straight up bullying and I told him to mind his own business and walk away. Honestly I don't know why he would do something like that, probably caused my friend group to get apprehensive of me. Anyway AITA?"

            "text": "Hello! So even though I like dogs I've never owner any, so I wanted to see if what I've done is actually against dog park etiquette.\n\nWe're currently in lockdown. The only thing we're allowed to do is exercise outdoors, as long as we stay within 5km of our home. \n\nThe closest park to me is a dog park (essentially a big field ringed by a fence), which is great because my toddler absolutely ADORES dogs. He knows how to approach a dog and be friendly, and doesn't mind when a doggie bowls him over in excitement. We will take a walk  there twice a week so he can run off some energy. \n\nHe is also currently obsessed with golf. We bought him a little plastic golf set, and it comes with these small plastic golf balls. \n\nYesterday we went to the dog park and he carried his golf club and small ball with him. Once we got to the park, he proceeded to putt the ball around, taking the occasional break to Pat any dogs that came up to us. \n\nA small dog (it looked like a cocker spaniel I think) ran up to us and after getting a pat, picked up my toddlers golf ball and legged it. The owner who had been watching from a distance (we were all socially distancing) freaked out and ran after it. I ran too to catch up to her in case she needed any help. Both my toddler and the dog seemed to think this was hilarious, and everyone was just running around for a bit. Eventually the spaniel dropped the ball, and the owner of the dog picked it up. \n\nI ran up to her laughing thinking she might find it funny too, but she was fuming. She held onto the ball and told me it was irresponsible to bring such a small thing to a dog park. She said her dog could have swallowed it, and she would have sued me for the cost of getting it out. I apologised (I have a small child - I know the anxiety of something dumb and lovable trying to swallow dangerous things) and opened my hand to get the ball back. But she kept getting more and more upset, saying that if I didn't have a dog that I wasn't allowed to even come to the park. \n\nI think I apologised again and asked for the ball back. She didn't seem to hear me, so I finally said in a raised voice: Give me the ball back, PLEASE. She told me I was being rude, lobbed the ball in the direction of my toddler (I don't think she was trying to hit him), leashed her dog and walked off. \n\nSo AITA for bringing a small ball to the dog park? And do dog owners think it's an AH thing to come to a dog park when you have no dog? I'll stick to tennis balls from now on, because I'm pretty sure they're harder to swallow."

I tell my vet and they say, well have her take them slow.\n\nI  make sure she walks slowly. Third day I noticed she was still bleeding considerably. I got down to the floor and checked. She had torn 3 of the farthest back stitches out. I rush her to the nearest emergency vet and they stapled her up and said no stairs. I don't have anywhere to go that didn't have stairs, mom hates dogs and besides she decided to foster my cousins dog for a while my dog is not dog friendly.\n\nBut, theyre out camping. My sister says I can stay until they came back hopefully it would be enough time for her heal enough to go upstairs. They came back two days later and I left before then. It wasn't enough time the staples tear out and my dog begins bleeding but not as bad.\n\n I ask through text as she works and I ask if she minds and say I can take her dog to my place to ease tension and she can even have my kid gate so the dog can stay in one place. She responds yes I do mind but I want to help you, and no my dog stays here and we don't need the gate. When I get into the vet they say no stairs. And they want to watch the tear I let my mom know that in only three days I have another vet appointment to see if it'll be okay.\n\nWe get there vet says no, the tissue around the entire incision has died they take her for surgery completely removed the necrotic tissue and re-suture. (I'd like to avoid more pain for my dog) still no stairs. I can tell it's getting on mom's nerves. We had to lock my dog in the kitchen using a card table and their moveable dishwasher, and I sleep on the pullout couch despite the fact that I live near.

I've never seen her use it.. my sister does. she said to me (oops also shes going on vacay for ten days) \"when I come back I don't want you here I don't want to see your dog here.\" my total time at her house has amounted to two weeks.\n\nAITA for staying as long as I have? \n\nTL;DR I stayed at my mom's for 2 weeks with my dog so she could heal properly initially mom wanted to help but now she's pissed off"

It\u2019s the same situation for my older brother (35), since the house our family owns is big enough for everyone to have their own spaces. \n\nEven though I make a modest living at work, which is a physically and mentally exhausting job, I have always been generous when it comes to my younger siblings, but some of them appreciate it more than others. \nI have two younger sisters (18 and 17) then a brother (16), and while the girls always show they appreciate me when I do things for them, the brother is both not appreciative but he also has constantly done things that shows he doesn\u2019t appreciate the things I\u2019ve done for him, like helping him with major school projects and getting an attitude back from him, or wanting equal time using \u2018family\u2019 things and him hogging it.\n\nFor example, I would sometimes buy certain snacks that I like and he would eat up to 70% of them if they were left in the kitchen, so I invested in a lock box. Well, the boy got around that by forcing his hand through a gap, which several times caused the thing, like soda cans etc. to EXPLODE inside the box, making a mess on top of him stealing my stuff. I would get mad and all, but he would continue to do it no matter the sit downs or whatever my parents would do to punish him. So for a while I distanced myself from doing things for him, until now:\n\nBasically this summer my sister and I wanted to go to the nearby amusement park, (The other is going out of state for a program) so we decided to get season passes since we figured we would go several times this summer and that would make the most financial sense. Of course, this then turned into not wanting to leave the younger brother out, especially since he also has friends with passes, so I ended up getting him one too. \n\nWell, on the day that we go my brother who has been applying around for summer jobs decided to apply at the amusement park because he saw cute girls working there too \ud83d\ude44. \nAnd guess what, no less than a week later he gets hired! At that park, staff gets free entrance, which means the pass I bought him is basically wasted since they don\u2019t do refunds or transfers or anything.\nThat time isn\u2019t all his fault or anything, but it does still mean I wasted $60.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if it would make me petty to have him pay me back for the pass now that he is going to be making his own money, especially after his history of stealings things from me? \n\nI feel like it might make me TAH to hold it against him went I\u2019m the one who bought the pass to be nice, and not learning my lesson about \u2018No good deed goes unpunished\u2019 when it comes to him.\n\nSo, WIBTA?"

I\u2019ve continued to attend a boxing class even as an adult. The boxing gym is in Japan, however, majority of the members are American since we\u2019re near a U.S. base. We\u2019ve been members of the boxing gym for probably 5 years now and since my mother (is Japanese) speaks both English and Japanese (as I do myself) we often help out the gym when it comes to translating. We have grow close to the instructor and owner of the gym and other members attending practice. \n\nSo fast forward to now, a new girl (local Japanese girl) joined the gym and from the get go she\u2019s there to get American dick. Which is fine, everyone has different motives for joining\u2026 So she speaks a bit of English and her demeanor doesn\u2019t seem genuine. I have the impression that she thinks she\u2019s inferior to other Japanese members because she can speak a bit of English. The girl has little interest in other Japanese members and her sole focus is on the Americans. Whatever, I\u2019ve seen it happen before and it\u2019s only new to me. \n\nAs soon as she found out my mom and I speak English her whole attitude to us changes. The girl barely regarded us, but now goes out of her way to ignores us. Greetings are mandatory in Japan and she will greet everyone accept for us. My mom tried speaking to her about information about joining, but she deliberately ignored her. I got mad and told her that my mother is asking her a question a bit firmly. The girl made it seem like she didn\u2019t hear her, which was a lie. Whenever my mom translates the girl gives her the dirtiest look.

My mom got mad at me for defending her, saying if I was mature enough then I wouldn\u2019t have said anything. I\u2019m appalled, I\u2019m not going to sit around and let some stranger disrespect my family like that.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be rude to me, since I don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019m there to keep up with what I learned with all my life and exercise. But giving attitude to my mom, all she does is help that gym whenever she has the time to come\u2026 unacceptable. I think she needs to know her place. Like this isn\u2019t a fucking club, get your American dick elsewhere. I don\u2019t care if it makes me look bad, but I\u2019ll continue to call her out if she\u2019s being rude to my mom. Am I in the wrong for that?"

Both short and long term, so at this point I have forgotten about my plans with sister#2) I told her I would. \n\nA few hours after I got home I remembered about my plans with sister#2. (and *at that point* I had already forgotten about my agreement with sister#1) yadayadayada, more hours pass by and I suddenly remember about BOTH plans and realize that I had agreed to do two things on the same day at the exact same times. \n\nI thought about it for a while and decided to text sister#1 that I can\u2019t babysit anymore because I forgot I promised to do something with sister#2. I did this because I had made plans with sister #2 *first* so I thought it was only fair to do so. Sister#1 said it was fine, but I still think I WBTA because I said yes to something but later basically said sorry, no I can\u2019t all because I couldn\u2019t remember... AITA?"

As a result we often disagree on whether something happened a certain way.\n\nA few minutes ago he told me to calm down, to which I said I was calm and now here we are ten minutes later with conflicting stories on whether or not I raised my voice. So I took into consideration that I missed my medicine dose and apologized but I phrased it as \"if I raised my tone I am sorry.\" I thought this was the perfect thing to do. It lets me keep my dignity and he gets an apology. However he feels that it isn't fair to him because \"since I did actually raise my tone it makes my apology feel half-baked.\"\n\nWhat do you all think? Am I being inconsiderate or is he being too demanding?"

            "text": "Some other posts reminded me of this. It happened about a year ago and I have had no contact with my ex friend since then.\n\nMy friend had to go abroad for a year for work and asked me to take care of his two cats for him. I agreed because I like cats and before he left I calculated how much they would cost in food, kitty litter, and regular medication, but didn't ask him for anything for their care. I showed the calculations to my friend and expected him to transfer the amount on a monthly basis. This didn't happen and he only transferred money once when I contacted him because one if the cats needed surgery and once more when I reminded him. After that I gave up asking him for money for the cats and just paid for everything myself, even when the costs for various reasons ended up exceeding my monthly calculations.\n\nAfter one year had passed, I was informed that his stay had been extended another year and I kept taking care of the cats without complaints, but when he finally returned home after two years, he didn't come pick them up. The reason was that he had no stable housing and his cats didn't get along with his grandmother's dog (se mainly lived with his grandmother). During this time, he did occasionally give me some money for cat food, but still nowhere close to the actual costs. I didn't press the issue and pretty much considered them my cats now because it had been years and he showed no signs of wanting them back.\n\nThen I started hearing from mutual friends that he was complaining about me behind my back. Saying things like that I stole his cats and he can't take them back because my family loves them so much and also claiming that I have been exaggerating the amounts that the cats have cost and trying to rip him off. I saw actual screenshots of these conversations.\n\nShortly afterwards, he finally got his own apartment and I of course offered to give him his \"stolen\" cats back. He told me that he wasn't allowed to keep pets in his apartment, but was going to find them another home so that they wouldn't bother me anymore. At this point, I told him that they of course could stay at my house, but he ignored this. During the following couple of weeks, he kept saying things about me behind my back (this time about how awful I was for wanting to dump the cats off at his apartment when I knew he wasn't allowed to keep pets), while saying something completely different to my face. I got tired of this and just brought the cats over to him (with his permission) and left.\n\nNow, the cats most likely had a much better life at my place with a lot more space, better food, better care overall (my friend didn't keep the litter boxes in good condition) and actual veterinary check-ups. He clearly didn't want the cats back despite what he was saying to my face. Was I an asshole for still bringing them back to him?"

            "text": "TLDr, My(26M) sister(22F) wants to move into our guest room(that is rarely used) but my wife (28F) doesn't want her to because she wants her privacy.\n\nMy sister wants to move in with my wife and I from my parents house because she finds it hard to focus on college with my 4 other younger siblings. She also comes over to chill once in a while and it's fine. My wife and my sister get along well from what I see. \n\nThe issue is that my wife wants her privacy. She doesn't mind when my sister comes over but doesn't want her to live her. My wife wants to be able to walk around without a bra on or not have to worry about other people in the house. Also My wife is an extrovert that likes to go out while my sister is pretty introverted and during her stay will likely not want to go out very much and that bothers my wife. My issue is that if it were her sister(22f) I would have zero issues and that same sister has come to stay for weeks to months because of things like failed relationships and such. When I brought this up in the conversation and compared my sis to hers and how it'd be unfair she called me an AH for not respecting her privacy. I also point out that my sister will be paying for rent and utilities which will help us in our goal to buying a house but my wife says it's worth having her privacy. So am I the asshole for wanting my sis to move in?\n\nShould be noted that my wife and I are both full time employees and are out of the house from about 9 AM to 5-6 PM and my sister is a full time college student that is planning on finding a part time job."

I don't have to get a job as long as I stay in school, and so it's a pretty nice living situation.\n\nMy boyfriend has two younger brothers (10m) and (7m). The issue came about yesterday, my boyfriend's dad was at work and he told my boyfriend to keep an eye on his brothers.\n\nPart of the reason why my parents were so shitty was because I was essentially used as a free babysitter for my own siblings, and I felt like my boyfriend was being used similarly, and he didn't even realize it, and I had to explain why it was wrong and discouraged him from acting as the second parent, and he finally realized how wrong it was.\n\nWell. Apparently one of his younger brothers complained to his dad when he came home because my boyfriend didn't do some things for him and his other brother and now it's a big fight, my boyfriend's dad is mad at me for unveiling what he'd been doing to my boyfriend and told me I was a brat, I think he's just mad that I made sure my boyfriend isn't being taken advantage of anymore.\n\nBut I live in his house and I don't want to be made homeless so for the sake of my safety and my continuing to live here. Aita?"
