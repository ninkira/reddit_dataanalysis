            "text": "So I recently started a new job in food service and one night a lady brought in a dog that clearly wasn\u2019t a service animal and put it on a seat in the restaurant. \n\nIn the group chat my head manager was telling everyone that we need to have dogs who only have a vest on allowed in store and someone in the group chat commented \u201cyeah we don\u2019t serve Chinese food here.\u201d And reasonably and thankfully everyone was upset about this comment. But what made it worse was that he replied \u201cit\u2019s not racist.\u201d Followed up with a picture of a news article showing the Chinese dog meat festival and then further replies with \u201cthey do this in Mexico too, I\u2019m Hispanic BTW.\u201d \n\nAnd this honestly offended me immensely because I\u2019m Chinese myself and I absolutely do not tolerate any type of racism directed at me or anyone else for that matter and \u201cjokes\u201d don\u2019t make anything ok because, jokes and harassment, specifically towards Asians especially has been so normalized and accepted to the point where nobody really cares. \n\nAnd a lot of the time Asians aren\u2019t even seen as POC or as a marginalized group when we very much are.\n\nSo anyways fast forward and this guy sends me a long text \u201capologizing\u201d but still low key kind of defending himself, and apologizes to me in person. \n\nNow mind you this man is 25 years old, he\u2019s a kid and he\u2019s not a young dumb teenager either, he\u2019s an adult. I\u2019ve met children who know better than he does when it comes to things like this but mind you there are tons of ignorant adults but still\u2026 come on.\n\nI told him I appreciate the apology but it\u2019s not really accepted and I also said that I will be civil with him but never friends. \n\nHe replied saying that he wanted to be great friends here and outside of work which is nice but personally as of right now I don\u2019t want that. And at the end of things o told him the best thing that he could do for me now is to stay away from me. And I\u2019m return he said ok but he\u2019ll still be nice to me and he\u2019s said a few things to me lately but so far I\u2019ve ignored him and shrugged him off. \n\nWhat bothered me the most though is that he genuinely was trying to be funny with that comment and for me that\u2019s a big red flag because if casual racism Is in  his sense of humor, what else does he think is funny, what else does he \u201cjoke\u201d about, you know? \n\nSo yeah. Am I the asshole for not forgiving him and moving on?"

            "text": "Last week, my mom got angry when she didn't get the immediate answer that she wanted. \n\nI was supposed to go to my boyfriend's family's birthday lunch (where only 5 people will attend including me). Since I don't have my license yet, she wanted to drive me to the venue since she said that they can do their grocery shopping within the area as well.\n\nWe live far away so if they shop within the area, they have to pay a huge amount of toll fee. So I told her my boyfriend was willing to go to our house to fetch me and his parents wanted us to go together as well (instead of me just being dropped off to eat with them). She kept on forcing to drive me there... I didn't understand why given the toll fee, but I maintained a calm voice throughout the conversation. \n\nWhen I mentioned that of course I also wanted to go with my boyfriend to have some alone time, she went ballistic and got angry because I didn't give her that answer immediately. My family and I aren't very comfortable with relationship/love/boy talks so I don't really bring it up. \n\nNow she's giving me the silent treatment and pretends like I don't exist. She doesn't talk to me, she doesn't look at me, and she refers to me as \"her\" instead of calling me by my name. I don't understand how something so simple snowballed when it could've been discussed calmly - especially since I never shouted at/disrespected her.\n\nI'm an adult (23F) but I feel like she doesn't treat me like one.

            "text": "TLDR: Mom had a stressful day, when parents griped at me to move my car, after I had already offered to, I griped back at them and now I'm expected to just let people treat me with disrespect.\nContext here is probably important. I am 23 (f) living with parents due to the pandemic and school costs. I also have ASD and often miss social cues or react inappropriately. I get I may need to just calm down but for years I've been groused at, not allowed to cry, or I get in trouble even now if I show any emotion other than happy it feels like. If I'm upset because others are upset then they get onto me for it. Tonight mom had a stressful day, all day and I had come out to try and help her park and move stuff from her car even though I feel sick and asked if I needed to move my car so she could fit in her spot which although I hadn't moved my car in 2 days she had trouble parking next to, she said no. I still stayed out to watch just in case when my dad told me to move my car out of nowhere and quite forcefully. I told them to hold on in a tone I guess they didn't like. My room is all the way upstairs and since I'm not feeling great I took a while, grabbed them and came out to them being even more grumpy. When I came back I was told to 'cut the attitude' and I asked. \"So why is everyone else allowed to have an attitude today but I'm not.\" \"Because you need to be nice to them.\" Was his response. Later he pulled me aside, and in a tone he had used with me as a kid told me that when other people have a bad day, instead of having an attitude I need to learn to \"let them be upset\" by saying hurtful things or taking it out on me. I said nothing, I didn't want to make it worse at this point but it honestly just... sounded so backwards to me and he continued. \"I know its unfair but sometimes things are unfair.\" So... am I not allowed to be upset as well? I understand others can and are allowed to be upset, but as soon as I am as well I'm in the wrong? Help me out reddit, am I missing something here or am I being used as an emotional punching bag?"

            "text": "So, about a year and a half ago, I was hired by this company to sub for someone who was on sick leave. The way things work where I am, if you take sick leave, your job will be protected for as long as a doctor says you need to be out. I was hired knowing already that my contract would end when this person came back, unless there was another position for me at the company when they did. \n\nOver the course of the year and a half I worked there, I realized that my co-workers REALLY didn't like the person (M) I was subbing for. It wasn't anything personal, it just seemed like M had been there for too long, had started to slack off, and basically didn't do anything they were supposed to do. About a month ago, I was informed that M's sick leave wasn't going to be renewed and they were coming back. My supervisor called me into his office and told me that they really liked my work and wanted me to continue working with them, but it depended on whether M was open to being transferred to another department, because they were required to hire them back to the same post. They talked to this person, they refused the transfer, and I was offered the position at that other department, which I declined. I don't like the kind of work that is done at that department and decided I was better off looking elsewhere. \n\nNow here's where things get muddy. My supervisor told me that they really wanted me to \"train\" this person to do what I was doing (even though in reality it was their job in the first place!). He said he was asking me this to make for a smoother transition and because M might need an \"update\". I came into work one day (for free! It was after my contract had ended), talked to them and gave them a list of my weekly tasks and a general idea of how I did each of them. I wasn't comfortable sharing every single thing in detail because, I mean, deep down I want to go back and work there and I want them to want to have a reason to want to hire me. It doesn't feel fair, specially because I did a lot of staff training, projects, plans, etc, that required a lot of materials that I had to make on my own time. M asked if I would share that with them and I politely said no, they were mine and maybe they could make their own based on what I had told them. This was the final straw. M got really angry at me, said I was actively standing in the way of them meeting the supervisor's expectations from the start, that I wanted their job, that I wasn't acting in a way that ensured there would be \"continuity\" between my work and theirs and that I was sabotaging them.\n\nNow, here's the thing. I started feeling bad because, well, maybe I am sabotaging someone and should really take the loss and be nice, but at the same time, it feels really unfair that I just give up everything. AITA?"

The problem is that she would unleash her stress and frustration on the rest of our family. She'd be in a pissy mood, have an attitude and just be a little rude. It's gets really annoying. She told me once it's because of our family but still... why be so rude to our parents.Then when someone tells her to act properly or when I ask her why she's being like this, she just tells us to stop. OR she would say she's improved... but she hasn't.\n\nIn the past (when I was in high school) she would be telling me to not let my frustration out on the rest of the family but now she's being a hypocrite. So I step up and tell her to act like an adult and stop being rude. I'll admit when I do I get angry and say some mean things but she does this thing constantly and I'm over it. I don't want her to be rude to our parents anymore especially since they've stopped even trying to calm her down bc they know she'll just get angry. (Even stopped asking her to do certain things for them bc she'll get frustrated). Am I the asshole here? Am I overstepping my boundaries as the younger sister??"

            "text": "I'm a 18M, and I'm currently living with my parents as colleges and stuff are shut down. An extended family member (my dad's uncle grandchild)  recently moved close to my house. Lets call her CB. CB is married and has a 1 year old kid. My colleges are scheduled to reopen(possibly with 2 week), and we'll have exams soon after. So I'm currently preparing for my exams and also completing my assignments and stuff. One day CB comes to our house, along with the kid and i played with the kid and stuff (we're all fully vaccinated) .After some time she had a wonderful idea, i should babysit for her, since she's \" really tired and stressed by taking care of the baby\" and also because i seem to get along with the kid and me babysitting for her would allow her to take breaks. I straight up refused. I said i was busy. Apparently she doesn't know how to take no for an answer. First came the sugarcoating along with asking me to babysit. When i still stood my ground, she started getting mad. Saying we wanted to see her suffer and I'm heartless and stuff. She went home, and within an hour dad's getting calls and texts from the entire family. For some reason everyone thinks i used babysit. They said i can study after babysitting or even during it, and some are scolding me for not completing my assignments earlier.\n\nThings got a bit more out of hand when CB's mom called my dad. Telling him that i have to babysit, since dad had loaned some money from them, last month. We had loaned some money from them when we had to fix our leaking roofs(its a new house but idk why, water was seeping in if it rained). Dad already paid back half of it, the deal was to pay it back over the next few months. Since the money issue got involved dad's also asking me to babysit. He can pay it back, but the sudden change in the plan would most probably lead to us being in a very tight financial situation. But i just didn't want to babysit for them anymore anytime. How they blew up the issue is infuriating. So i said no, i will not babysit for them. Now about half the side of the family is angry at us. I told my dad I'll pay back the remaining cash(I'd have to borrow it from my friends) but he said no, he'll pay. \n\nSo dad paid back the cash, we're in an pretty tight situation financially, half the family is angry at us for not babysitting. I can actually pass the exams without the rigorous studying and can complete the assignments if sleep late for a few days. So now i feel like all this could have been avoided, if i tried. AITA."

I only knew his fianc\u00e9 (Mary) and her family but none of the friends and people my brother had met.  I attended the celebration of life with her family and no one from our family (we grew up in foster care so we didn't have anyone really but eachother) His fiance and family separated to hang out out friends and drink. I was left completely alone to grieve when I knew no one.  The fiance left early to hang out and bar hop with friends which left me alone to take care of her 2 sisters and mom and my nephew who was 4 at the time. both sisters and mom got so wasted that I ended up driving driving home. they puked in the car and all over me, I made my nephew dinner and put him to bed while they passed out. Mary didn't get home till 2am the next morning and passed out herself. I ended up getting Uber ride to the airport without a single goodbye or anything. I know everyone grieves different but I was so upset and angry for leaving me alone, for having to care of her family and for my poor nephew who cried for my brother and no one was there but me to care for him and hold him. I sobbed alone the entire night. I was hurting from his death as it but I didn't think I was going to feel this alone. \n     a week later I held a celebration of life since we had lived most of our life in Alaska and had many friends here. Mary never came even though my husband and I had paid for both her and my nephews ticket. I was trying to be understanding that it would be too hard for her to go to 2 celebration of life and she wasn't ready to talk about him. \n   almost a month later, Mary contacted me and blew up about how incredibly rude it was of me not to even check in on her even though she let me stay with her in New York for the celebration of life.. I told her I wasnt cutting them out but was angry and was not ready to reach out. She got so angry and claimed I wasn't the only one who lost someone- she had too. lotd of arguing and cussing and hurtful words were said until She hung up and blocked me. \n   AITA for being angry about what had happen at my brothers celebration of life? was it selfish of me assume Mary would keep me company as we were both loosing someone we loved. I was really hurting for losing my best friend and the only person who could relate to all my childhood trauma because he experienced them too if not worse."

I'll try my best to represent both sides\n\nSo usually we allocate tasks and decide who does which parts. It's a big two storey house. I ask to clean my bedroom and the two bathrooms in the house. My brother (M15) decides to take the his bedroom and the living room. My mother takes the kitchen, laundry room and her bedroom. My father doesn't clean the house with us. He usually goes upstairs goes on his phone. My mother has tried to make him clean and they've had several fights over it.\n\nIt's fine by me and I'm kind of used to it plus my dad is really nice in every way so I don't mind. Anyways I go ahead and clean up my parts of the house. I work pretty fast though so I finished before everyone else and stayed up in my room to relax a bit.\n\nMy mother walks upstairs and sees me sitting there so she yells at me to come down and help her with her work. I tell her that I already did what I promised to do and we all made a deal.\n\nI should probably mention by now that my family is very cultural and this means that I have to listen to everything my parents say and worship them in a way. Every time, I start arguing to explain my POV, I get shut down real quick for talking back and disrespect. \n\nSo this makes my mum blow up. She starts talking shit about how disrespectful useless and lazy I am and how I deserve to burn in hell. I got taken aback and I said but the deal was that we each do our share. She storms off and goes to yell at my brother instead to help her out.\n\nNow my brother is a literal saint. He quickly finished his own work and worked with my mother not complaining once. He's like the perfect child to my parents and they always tell me to be like him or I'll face bad luck in life because I make them mad. It's like God revolves around them and if I don't pay back the debt of them raising me, I'll be cursed for my whole life.\n\nI decided to be firm with my decision this time because I was pissed. She wanted me to do more work. Now my mother is loudly talking shit about me all around the house to shame me. She refuses to talk to me and when I went to her to sort things out she told me to get out of her room.\n\nTo help this make more sense, let me tell you more about my mother. She always thinks she's right over us and as our mother she'll always be right. I challenged her with this once (another story for another day) and she didn't talk to me for a couple of days. She also never apologises when she is clearly in fault.\n\nI may be painting my parents in a bad light here so let me clarify some things. They've been wonderful and supportive parents to me aside from their little 'quirks' and always meet my needs and wants. As long as I'm following their rules, which is, essentially just following whatever they say, they are really supportive and nice.\n\nReddit, AITA for refusing to do more to clean the house?"

Something from her childhood makes her freak out, she thinks she\u2019ll be able to guess what\u2019s in the (wrapped) presents and the surprise will be ruined.\n\nShe\u2019s always asked us to get her something \u201cfrom the heart\u201d but will give no other descriptors or ideas as to what she wants gift-wise.

She said I should apologize to her. \n\nI didn\u2019t, but I talked to her and she said basically the same as my mom. It was weird. She acted mad at me.

I get dizzy, headaches, nausea, extremely weak, no appetite, basically any symptom of a general illness you can name, ive had it. I am currently in the process of getting blood tests so hopefully the issue will be found and sorted...\n\nAnyway, the first symptom i got back in december is this stomach ache. It is EXCRUCIATINGLY painful and the first tike it lasted two whole weeks... Now i get it about three times a week and it lasts on average a few hours so a couple days...  \n\nThis morning i woke up with one of those stomach aches. I walk an hour to school and i knew that i could not do that walk because of the pain. I asked my mum for a lift to school and she said no, no reason she just didnt want to. She never drives me to school so i wasnt exactly suprised by this, but i asked her if i could just sit for 15 or so minutes and then leave, so hopefully my stomach ache would hurt less or fade or something by then so i could walk.\n\nShe said no, that school starts at 845 and i either arrive on time or i am too ill to go to school. Today is my last thursday before the summer holiday so i wanted to go to school. I told her i thought she was being infair, and school would appreciate me being there even it it was 20 minutes late. I am never late to school so one day hardly makes a difference. She got super mad at me and implied i was being selfish.\n\nI really dont think my request was that ridiculous....so, AITA?"

I have no interest in it. I go to church with them once a week because I have to but I don't want to convert and become part of it at any point in the future. This upsets them and my stepmom has been especially pushy, saying don't I want to share the same beliefs as my family, etc. I said I do. That the family I grew up with share the same beliefs as me and I'm happy with that. She said they're my family too and they're the ones I live with and will have in my life most going forward. My dad told me he always regretted not helping me see the light sooner but my mom was against it. I said I was glad he didn't because being religious didn't interest me in the slightest.\n\nThis summer they have gone even more into church stuff and are doing way more within it. They keep asking me to join them and be more involved but I'm not going to convert for this crap. I also refused to talk to their pastor which upset them even more and I rejected a church camp for being a church camp (no way am I having what I can wear dictated based on religion).\n\nThey snapped at me the other night when my half brother (8) asked me to join him for something in his church camp and I said no. They told me I should take more of an interest in the family religion and stop treating them badly because I don't agree with their beliefs. I said it was them treating me badly for my beliefs or lack of.\n\nIt's been pretty intense lately.\n\nAITA?"

This is Danny\u2019s first real bf and she\u2019s super excited and our whole friend group is happy for her. I\u2019ve known Greg prior to them dating and I\u2019m not fond of him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the best since he failed all his classes freshman year and came to school stoned most days, but i saw how happy he made my friend so i drop it. \n\nAround this time I start talking to a guy from my school.

She blows up on me about how I don\u2019t trust her anymore and that I don\u2019t talk to her like I use to. I offer her an apology as I had been ghosting her for a few days while I grieved the loss of my dog, but she retaliates with saying that I ghosted her on her mother\u2019s birthday and I could have simply told her I wasn\u2019t going to the birthday party. \n\nWe were both pretty upset and I wanted to stop arguing so I apologized again but she just shrugged it off and gave me the silent treatment. 4 weeks go by of little to no contact with me doing most of the talking and she finally decides to block me on everything.

I was not a fan from the beginning.\n\nMy dad is here, but staying that his house a couple streets away. He drove us on the boat and has talked to everyone and before he left he asked me (his only child who is there) to take care of the fire. He is particular about the fire and not wanting others tending the fire and possibly injuring themselves. \n\nSo we are all sitting around the fire and Q gets up and grabs the fire poker and starts messing with the fire so I said \u201chey, my dad is really particular about the fire and asked me to be the sole person to take care of it. I can stoke it, thank you though\u201d and she responded with \u201cI was a Girl Scout so I know what I\u2019m doing\u201d ...okay? I got her to leave it alone and give me the poker. But she started talking shit about me as soon as she sat down and I could hear her.\n\nNext everyone was doing beer bongs and they ran out of beer. She went to my dads kegerator, without asking, and got his nice IPA for a beer bong. I asked her if that was was from the kegerator and she said \u201cyeah?\u201d And so I responded with \u201cthat is my dads nice IPA, we shouldn\u2019t use that for beer bongs. Please ask before you just grab stuff like that\u201d.\n\nNext thing, I grab a drink that has the same can coolie as mine and start drinking it. Has the same straw and everything. She grabs it from me saying it was hers, but I took it back and showed her it was mine. I ended up finding mine a little bit later and apologized saying \u201cQ, you were right that was yours. Sorry for the confusion!\u201d \n\nNext this I know she is talking shit about me out loud to other members of the bachelorette party. So I say something and confront her.

Those things happened as a timeline from when I was in middle school until 2nd year in college. The main thing is, growing mostly with my mother, I had to tell her the good and bad things, such as school grades.\n\nShe has a Scorpion zodiac sign and I've seen most Scorpion people have a tendency to manipulate / control the situation in their favour. Over those long years I developed an unnatural fear of telling my mother something bad about school, as she would always overreact. In middle school and even high school, she would regularly come and check on my grades, even though I was really doing great and studying a lot.\n\nMoving to the current days, I managed to get in the best University in my town, studying Computer Science as I have a passion for programming. Being also a pretty difficult university to graduate from, I was a bit lazy in the 1st and 2nd years (total of 4 years), but I managed to pass my failed exams. Now, there is a subject called 'Microcontrollers'. I failed it in the 3rd year, and also now. \n\nSince I only have this exam left, I at least completed my Bachelor Degree project and told my parents that \"Hey, I didn't managed to pass this subject, even though I tried my best and I have to retake it in september and if I succeed, I get my diploma.\". The curious thing is also that there are also 40 other students in their last year, who also failed this subject. Ever since I told them the bad news, I get constantly scolded and called names for not managing to pass one exam and even more fucked up things like \"You ruined your life and career, you are not good at anything, why are you not like other person's children, who graduated and even land a job in IT while they were already in college\" etc.\n\nBeing in an environment like this, I am always constantly telling myself that I am not so good even at what I love to do, and over the past years my self-esteem dropped really low, many times I was even contemplating that it would have been better if I didn't exist if I cannot meet their expectations, since I cannot make anybody happy and even had depression episodes.\n\nMy girlfriend told me and even tried to convince me that I actually am a smart person and not the one my parents (my mother) told me I am, not the dumb and stupid one that I thought I was, since I would always help her with her college projects / programming homeworks (she is 1 year older than me, graduated and is now studying for a Master's degree). And yet, here I am, last year in college, gotta have to study those 2 months to try to pass my exam in September, and if I succeed, I can also graduate in that month."

I took the remains of the mug to my brother and told him what happened. I apologized and asked if it was important. He said One of her college friends gave it to her, and I was feeling very guilty at that point\n \nHe told me that I should just throw it away and she'll just forget about it. I took it as a joke and said I'll tell her about it when she gets home.\n\nLater in the evening pollie comes home and I told her what happened. She was honestly pretty cool about the whole thing and said it wasn't a big deal. I still apologized and offered to buy her a new mug. She said it was custom made and too much trouble. I honestly didn't mind and said I would cover the entire cost. She brushed me off again and I decided not to pursue further. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks. All 3 of us were in the kitchen, and we were having a small argument about pet problems. Pollie remarked about how I was an asshole about not replacing her mug.

My aunt was very offended and always tried to guilt trip my cousin telling her that grandpa does not love his son, and her father is ashamed of her for accepting (she was only 14).\n\nMy grandpa's health took a turn for the worse last year and my uncle took him in in December. They are taking care of him and don't want him to return to his house alone so he is staying with them from now on. He contributed to all expenses, paid for his own medication, etc.\n\nI think my grandma would have hated it if her sm went to the aunt. I already have an electrical sm, if I take it it will be used as decor because it is pretty difficult to handle. If the aunt takes it, I think she will use it to sew (never seen her interested in sewing but who knows).  \n   \n I do want the sm, I always wanted it, but never said it. \n\nI think I would be the AH if I ask my grandpa to give the sewing machine to me and not to my aunt, after she asked first and she is the one taking care of him, knowing that probably my grandpa will give it to me and that will make the relationship between the two of them much worse."

            "text": "Me (31) and my current husband (35) recently found out that we were expecting twin boys, and my first husband's mother is livid that we aren't naming one of them after her son.\n\nA little background. My first husband (Michael) and I were college sweethearts. We got married not long after graduation, and I thought I would be with him for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, we were only married for a couple of months before Michael passed away suddenly.\n\nIt was one of the worst times in my life and I never thought that I would ever fall in love again, much less get married again or have a family. I remained very close with Michael\u2019s mom, my MIL, and she was very supportive when I eventually started dating again. Not long after I met my current husband (John) I took him to her house so that they could meet. She was so excited to meet him and I remember going to the bathroom and crying tears of relief that she wasn\u2019t angry at me for moving on.\n\nWhen John and I got married she was so happy for me, and on my wedding day, she took me aside and told me that she knew Michael was happy for me too. It meant so much to me to hear her say that.\n\nEarlier this year, John and I found out that we were pregnant. At first, MIL was ecstatic, making jokes about being a \u2018bonus grandma\u2019 and asking to help plan the gender reveal party and baby shower. But then when the subject of names came up, she was shocked that we weren\u2019t planning to name the baby after Michael.\n\nI explained to her that if it was a boy, we were going to name him after John\u2019s father. I could tell she wasn\u2019t happy, but she seemed to accept it. Things took a turn for the worst after my twenty week ultrasound, when we found out that I was carrying twin boys. When I told her the news, she flat out told me that had to name one of the babies after Michael, or she would never forgive me. \n\nWhen I told her that we weren\u2019t going to do that, she absolutely flipped, saying that I was betraying the memory of her son. I tried to make her understand that as much as I love and miss Michael, that chapter of my life is over, and I feel like it\u2019s disrespectful to John to insist on naming one of his children after another man. At first John said that he would be fine with it, if it was what I wanted, but eventually he admitted that the idea made him uncomfortable.\n\nI never want to make my MIL think that I\u2019ve forgotten Michael or that he wasn\u2019t important to me, but I don't want to name one of my children after him either. And honestly, I don\u2019t think he would have wanted me to. There are better ways of remembering him than giving his name to a child that will never have any real connection to him.\n\nI tried explaining this to MIL, but she just wouldn\u2019t hear it. She told me that she would never speak to me again, if I didn\u2019t name one the babies after her son. She\u2019s been a really important part of my life, and I don\u2019t want to lose her, but at the same time, I feel like she\u2019s giving me an unfair ultimatum. AITA?"

I\u2019m writing on mobile, sorry in advance :-)\n\nI (19) was hanging out at a friends house, and was about to ride home with my roommate O (18) and our friend G (18). Roommate and I drove together in O\u2019s car, and picked up G because he does not yet have his license, only a permit.\n\nWhen we went outside, they said they had a surprise for me, and G hopped in the drivers seat. I asked if he got his license and he said no, so I thought they were joking and he wasn\u2019t really going to drive. O says since G is 18, he only technically needs someone else that\u2019s 18+ in the car with him to drive, so its perfectly legal. I correct him and say, in our state, he needs a parent, guardian, or person over 21 in the front seat. Even if he had a license, he could only have 1 passenger under 20 that isn\u2019t a family member for the first 6 months of driving. As I mentioned, I\u2019m autistic, and learning to drive stressed me out enough to make it a hyper fixation. I knew this info and fact checked myself on the spot to confirm.\n\nO could perfectly drive, it was illegal, and I was uncomfortable. I wouldn\u2019t get in the car. They seemed so excited to show me their loophole, but I wouldn\u2019t budge. G eventually said \u201cI\u2019m not gonna fight it\u201d and got in the passenger seat, and we rode in silence. I felt like a killjoy. G seemed fine when we dropped him off, but O kept on being silent until we got home and I asked him what was wrong. He said that the rules only matter when its convenient for me, and I have no clue what that means, because O or G driving doesn\u2019t change the convenience for me at all, and it\u2019s not like we break the law for fun or anything.

My parents got divorced when I was 4 and my brother has moved out.\nMy mother has been very controlling over what I can and cannot do. Whether it be my hair, clothes, hangouts, relationships, everything. In order to hang out with someone I had to provide an entire schedule, locations, phone numbers, and constant texts as to update her, and it\u2019s starting to finally get to me. I can\u2019t smile, frown, or even laugh at my phone without her questioning what I\u2019m looking at or who I\u2019m talking to. She bugs me every 5 minutes for no reason, walks into my room to say something or yell at me KNOWING I\u2019m having a conversation with someone. She does nothing to help around the house except the dishes like once a month, complains about something new every day, buys a lot of stuff she doesn\u2019t need with my grandparents\u2019 money, says I have an attitude no matter how nicely I try to say things, and holds grudges like no one I\u2019ve ever seen.

She's strictly vegan and the type to try and convince others to go vegan too in a not so nice manner. She is usually the first to plan and jump on protests all around animal rights and environmental protection.  \nI personally agree with 80% of what she's doing. Of course I support the message in what she's trying to preach but I do not condone some of her actions. \n\nShe's gone extreme lengths of \"go vegan\" and \"animals are friends\" kind of stunts. Mostly by protesting in front of, already struggling, restaurants and the like together with a hand full of others, which included shaming people who ordered meat and causing huge scenes when told to leave. She always thinks she's in the right and believes that nothing can be taken \"too far\". I'm afraid she's lost touch in that regard.\n\nAs I mentioned, I personally am on her side with the message but not with the over the top stunts. \n\nWe live in a pretty small city in the Czech republic and most people around here are not on the height with climate change and how bad it really is. I'm on Dania's side with trying to educate people on that issue, though her way of doing it is again very extreme and not for me.  \nThat being said, there's a small \"park\" in the city we live in. It's been neglected for the past 3 years and only still exists because of people like my friend Dania and her group of activists. They remove trash once a week and water the plants/trees in the summer.\n\nOur council has now, like a week ago, announced that they plan on removing the park in favor of a shopping mall to motivate tourists and the like to visit our city more often. It would be beneficial for our small hotels and the few struggling restaurants around here and of course, for the people living here since we usually have to drive elsewhere to do our shopping.  \nIt's also not like this park is extremely important. We have acres of untouched forests that are protected by law. I'm FOR the mall, but haven't told Dania that yet.\n\nAs you can imagine, when Dania heard of this plan, all hell broke loose. In the past days, she's gathered a lot of people who are like-minded to her, plotting a big protest and somewhat of a 'raid' on the council. Dania has told me a lot about her plans and I'm really worried about the length she and her group are willing to go.\n\nI didn't miss what happened in the US when people had plans like this, so I'm considering alerting the authorities of Dania's insane plot. I have already tried talking her out of this, but she will not listen regardless of the consequences that might come from it. \n\nWIBTA if I'd report this to the council?"

H\u2019s husband call me lazy and bitch for telling about my feelings. AITA for telling how I. Feel?(Sorry about my terrible grammar)"

We are not currently engaged or have any immediate plans for marriage. We do not own any property together or depend on eachother financially. I should also mention that I currently owe her about $7,500.\n\nShe knows I have a life insurance policy and we were talking about it recently. She jokingly mentioned that I should put her as a beneficiary so that she would receive funds upon my death; I said no and we laughed about it. The topic came up again tonight and she mentioned it again but in a more serious tone. I am adamantly against the idea of putting her as a beneficiary. Currently I have my death benefit split equally between my parents with the condition that they would use it to help themselves and my family financially if I were to pass away. She felt weirded out about this and doesn't understand why it is my responsibility to provide for my family. I had explained that it's normal for my culture (south American descent). She feels that it means that I don't care enough about her. \n\n(We wrote this post together and tried to make it as objective as possible)\n\nAITA for not putting my girlfriend as a beneficiary on my life insurance policy?"

            "text": "This is going to require some back story,  - some minor details have been changed to obscure identities.\n\nMy grandfather (mother's father) died two years ago, after a stay in the hospital. I was not able to see him for the year before his death. I was in college at the time, but had the money set aside to go for a visit. My mom talked me out of visiting when he was first hospitalized. She said nobody would let me stay with them, hotels were too expensive, I would fail out of school, and she was heading back so there was no need. She made a lot of comments about the irresponsibility of using money set aside for school on visiting my grandfather. My partner also offered to pay, but she was very strongly against it. He passed away while I was still in school, and I didn't get to say goodbye. I have felt very angry about this since, since. Moreso once I heard that other family members including cousins (children of my mother's siblings) were able to come in from out of state and say goodbye.\n\nRecently, my aunt (mothers sister) invited me to a birthday party for my grandmother's father. I was pretty excited, as I hadn't seen most of the family that was coming in years. My grandma is not doing well health wise. She has cancer, is old (80+), has had a spinal fracture and her vision is failing. As her cancer is metastasized to her bones, I am not sure she will be okay to travel for much longer. As it happened, I can get off of work. My partner can get off of work, and between us we could easily afford the trip. When I mentioned that I intended to go to my mother over lunch today, she began to throw out barriers - finding someone to watch our animals (we have two months to figure something out in that regard), the ability to afford it, the potential for it to be expensive. I got annoyed at this and told her that I could solve all these problems and I intended to go, as I didn't get to see my grandfather before he passed. Full disclosure, I was angry at the time. The subject was dropped, but she asked to send me the dates my aunt had sent me.\n\nI went into my work shift after lunch, and didn't get to text her until the evening. I sent her the dates as requested, and what followed was a very frustrating conversation. Knowing I was at work, and knowing that I would be hamstrung replying, she basically laid on a guilt trip about my adopted little sister not being able to attend, that it would make her look bad, and that if I went (with my own money) she would not be able to go see her mother. She also said it sounded like I blamed her for not seeing Grandpa, and that I wasn't being fair.\n\nI responded that I would be happy to pay for my sister, or for care for all our animals to help, but that I absolutely blamed her for not seeing grandpa, and here she was using guilt again in the same way. (Longer exchange, but running out of characters here). She didn't respond after.\n\nATIA?"

Which is true. I love my partner and my son and would love to go out with them but I quite literally haven't slept a single night through since our son was born. In fact, I've gone out of my way to make sure if our son wakes up, I tend to his needs and feed him back to sleep as quickly as I can so my partner can sleep. He is the sole provider until we can get our son into preschool so I think it's fair that my partner is able to sleep through the night, and have time to relax. While I am glad my partner does sleep and does get time to himself, I personally haven't had those pleasures yet and I feel like he doesn't understand how exhausted I am. Keep in mind I'm the only one who cleans anything involving the house unless I repeatedly ask him through out the day to take out the trash for example and that doesn't even get done for a couple of days. So I do try to ask for help, its just easier to do it alone to avoid the disappointment. I'm also the main care giver to our son. My partner takes our son out for activities and will play with him for maybe an hour a day at home, otherwise I do everything else involving our son(changing diapers, brushing teeth, bath time, naps and bed time, cooking meals and snacks, teaching and reading books, playing and activities at home, appointments, etc) alone on top of the very little sleep I've gotten in the past 2 years.\n\nAnyway, every time he asks if I want to go out and I say no I want to stay home and relax or take a nap, he guilts me. Mainly saying things like \"you never want to go out with us\" \"I get you're tired but so am I and I'm still going out with our son\". I stand my ground most times and stay home because the times I have gone out despite knowing I didn't have the energy, I just sat there on the verge of sleep and felt even worse that I wasn't interacting more. Also, keep in mind that the times I do stay home are mostly spent cleaning the house and finally laying down because there's always so much to do with how tired I am and how I'm the only one cleaning. \n\nSo my question is AITA for choosing to stay home instead of spending time with my partner and son outside the house?"

After she noticed that I was still glaring, she said that i have to go at least one day, Thursday from 5 pm to 8 pm, and if i didn't like it and gave her a reason she would pull me out and that if i did like she asked she would inscribe me on the ice skating. I said fine but i was still upset. \nShe noticed i was still upset after awhile and asked why and I just told her the truth, that she didn't respect my wishes and what i want to do.

Part of why I'm angry, is that if you break it down like that thr answer (to me) seems extremely obvious.\n\n\nMy wife and I have both been sick for a few days. So, we haven't been living by any kind of a schedule. Today, when we went to go to bed (around 3AM), my wife discovered that the dog had peed on our mattress. Of course, he managed to do it while we have the sheets and protector off because they are sweaty and gross from fever sleeping. (Possibly relevant, the dog in question is a 2-year-old Lab, so it was not a small amount).\n\n\nI volunteered to break out the carpet cleaner (we have an attachment for just such an occasion), and my wife told me she \"couldn't handle this\". I told her that I would take care of it, and she could start settling in on the couch, or she could wait and sleep in the dry side of the bed once I was done.\n\n\nShe still insisted that it made her too uncomfortable. She said it was too late because of the neighbors (fair point, but, this is kind of an emergency. It's not like we run the cleaner at 3AM routinely, this one time it is necessary and will be fine). \n\n\nShe was getting visibly upset at this point, and I tried to do what I've been learning in therapy, and said this verbatim \"I understand that you're tired and uncomfortable. Can you understand that in this case, cleaning now is more pressing than discomfort?\".\n\n\nThat was the *wrong* thing to say, and she stormed out. \n\n\nThis is the part with some asshole behavior from me. I got angry, and said very sarcastically \"I'm only choosing to do this because I don't care about your feelings, it's definitely not about the dog piss on our $4000 mattress that is less than a year old\". Full acceptance of the asshole statement. My goal was to show her how ridiculous it sounded to me, but that was not the thing to do and only made her feel worse.\n\n\nSo before I lost my cool, AITA for wanting to clean the mattress up despite her discomfort?"

When i looked closely at the invite, it had the RSVP date written in bold font...which was 5 days prior to my friend texting me the invite.\n\nI declined to go. It seems to me that the wedding probably did not have enough RSVPs for the reception probably due to COVID hesitations, so they are trying to ask \"random\" people they know to fill up the seats.

I find it hard to relate to because it feels like she spends more time documenting the night out than actually enjoying it, but each to their own.  \n  \nI have always really hated having my picture taken, and I especially hate it being posted online. I have asked her so many times not to photograph me and told her I don't want to be part of group shots, but she really doesn't accept it.

I found another job, took another health insurance and moved on.\n\nFast forward to yesterday when I was looking for a new health insurance because I wasn\u2019t satisfied with mine. I remembered that the one I had with the callcenter company was pretty decent so I checked their website to get a quotation. Turned out my login details were still working so I logged in and realized that not only my contract hadn\u2019t been terminated at all since 2018 but also that someone has since been using it to get medical bills paid for. \n\nI called the insurance and the lady told me that the transactions were made in Paris which is weird because I don\u2019t live there. Then, I remembered. At the time I worked at the callcenter, my friend S. told me that a good friend of hers worked in an eyewear shop in Paris and he could get me a pair of designer shades for free with my health insurance (so fraud, basically). I have to admit, I was interested at first so I sent S. a picture of my health insurance card but then I changed my mind and told her I wasn\u2019t interested anymore. But she had already sent my card to the guy and he is the one who used it to get whatever he needed. \n\nI told S. I was going to press charges against the guy for identity theft and insurance fraud and that\u2019s when she asked me not to because he\u2019s her friend and that would make her look bad and it\u2019s going to backfire on her. The thing is, the items that the insurance paid for have to be reimbursed and if I don\u2019t press charges against the guy, well it\u2019s going to backfire on me. \n\nI told this to another friend of mine who also knows S. and she told me I was acting a bit like an asshole because I could just make a deal with the guy so he pays everything back without me pressing charges."

            "text": "My husband and I adopted a little boy in an open adoption and have regular contact with his parents and grandparents. He spent 4th of July weekend with his Father's family and by all accounts had a great time. Their whole family are smokers while my husband and I are not. I have an allergy to cigarette smoke.\n    When I went to pick him up afterwards, his Grandmother handed him a box of retro candy cigarettes with the words, \"Don't forget your cigarettes! You're my new smoking buddy!\" I could see that the box was open and half full and asked, \"What is this?\" \"Oh it's just candy,\" she replied. I said, \"No. I don't want him thinking smoking is cool or fun - it's deadly, and he's 6 for crying out loud!\" She told me to lighten up - it's not a big deal. I asserted that when she calls him her smoking buddy and makes it this fun things to do with candy that she's essentially training him to be a future smoker and that's not a thing we encourage in our home. She rolled her eyes at me and said again that it's no big deal and she should be allowed to give her grandson whatever candy he wants. I reminded her that she while she has a right to her opinions, she has no right to interfere with how we take on the responsibility of raising him. Also, in this day and age with everything known about the risks involved with smoking why on earth would she want him to think it's a good thing? She got all offended, said I was judging her and trying to drive a wedge between her and her grandson. I told her that I was judging the tobacco industry and the way they get people hooked, that we want better for him, and that she needs to respect our decisions when it comes to raising him. She's still ticked at me and I feel like our trust in her has diminished. So am I making too big a deal about candy - am I the AH?"

            "text": "I (24F) and my BF recently moved into village where my father, his wife and my half-brother (7M) live. I did this, because of home-office and to support my father. My Father has blood-cancer, but a type, that gives normal life-span if you take daily medication. It still makes him weak and sometimes he needs help with chores that require body strength (carrying stuff, mow the lawn etc.). His wife helps kinda, but often refuses because \"she cant\". I hate her for this, but that is another story.  \n\n\nBack to the main part. My father and his wife started going on walks recently. But my half-brother does not always want to go with them. So my father asks me frequently, if he could stay at my place for half an hour. Usually my brother stays here for longer (often 1,5h), because he likes my non-judgmental household. So he is always excited to go here. But me and my BF are starting to feel pressured to always take him in.  \n\n\nSo a few days back, my father asks me, if i could babysit my brother again. But for the first time i said NO. I had to finish something for university and our apartment is a mess right now because of depressive episodes. My little brother also made comments about my last apartment, because it was \"stinky and dirty\" (I know that kids don't know better and that its my responsibility. But it still hurts because i'm trying my best and it really got better, but sometimes i just cant get up to clean).  \nSo i also wanted to avoid comments from my little brother and that he tells my father, that my apartment looks \"bad\" again.  \n\n\nAfter i told my father, that i dont want to babysit him, he sent me a disappointed smiley via text message. He also said, that they already started walking to my apartment and my brother is already excited. \n\nI told him again: 'i dont want to right now. at another time i would be happy to babysit him, but not now'. \n\nSo he just wrote to me: ' Well, okay. I will try to convince him to go on the walk with us.'\n\nIn my head i got furious, because why should you just \"try to convince\" him? If i say NO, it is a no! And how you handle it, is not my problem. But later, i felt really bad, because who doesn't have 30mins of their time? I also could have just stayed up a bit longer, so my dad can have a bit of free time with his wife.  \n\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to babysit my half-brother?"

So there is some tension there.\n\nThe first year I was with my boyfriend I kept him from my dad, because I just wanted to enjoy my new relationship without my dads negativity impacting me. \nI put my dad on low contact while I tried to built my happiness. My dad never said anything to my low contact decision- even though I straight up told him. He seemed to ignore my decision and pretended like everything was ok.\n\n\nThen he and his new girlfriend invited her daughter and me and my brother to a shore house for a week. \nEverything went ok for a while. On the third day i asked ( in a group setting) if my boyfriend could visit the last day to meet them all. My brother quickly agreed but my dad seemed to get mad and said I was selfish and I needed to ask everybody. We went on to talk in private and he said that my step sister asked to have a friend along for the week and they said no so he could not accept this. I said that this was different since it was my boyfriend and only for one day. He said I could pay for the shore house myself if I wanted him to come and started getting condescending and mean - even pushing me a little bit. \nI cried the whole day and tried to talk with him two times in a honest way but he just ignored me and said we wouldn\u2019t agree. \nThe next day I took the train home and made the decision to cut contact. Have had texts from him three times this year but he has never apologized. I have not responded. Still feel mad and hurt from this a year later.\nMy dad\u2019s part of the family has also decided that as long as I am not talking to my dad, I am not welcome at family gatherings. \n\nToday I got a text from my grand mother that dad and step mom have invited my brother and his new girlfriend and stepsister and her new boyfriend to a vacation home this summer and they are sad I could not come.

Once they finished yelling at them, and telling them they were assholes, they turned on me for accepting a gift so big when I knew my stepsister got something little, and how I should be advocating for equal treatment from my paternal side when she's their granddaughter too. They were also kinda pissed my maternal grandparents didn't give my stepsister anything which is weird to me since she's not related to them or even a friend. But I digress.

My parents planed a month long vacation for themselves as they do every year which in turn leaves us home alone. In the past the help would stay home with us or  we would join them. This year they decided to go alone. \n\nAnyway, right before the trip my dad was assigned to travel for work which would mean that the trip would have been postponed because he'd only return after their flight date, but instead my parents decided that my mom would just go the original dates and he'll meet her there. So this gave my sister and I 4 days of freedom between my mom leaving and dad returning. \n\nThose for day were hell!!! Immediately my sister invited some dude over and all they did was get drunk and make a disgusting mess. The whole house smelled like a brewery, they broke glasses and I think they used every dish in the house. So on day 2 I decided to clean their mess. And she was like sorry next time she will clean. Day 3 rolls around I come down stairs same thing, my dad is coming home the next day at 6am, she says she'll clean up and I shouldn't. \n\nSo I wait, the evening approaches, the place is still a mess, her and her man decide they will go out and get drunk. I'm like the kitchen, she's like she'll do it when she gets back. Knowing her, she wont, so I just do it. She gets back with her ex and brings alcohol again, my dad is landing in like 4 hours. She decides to cook and makes a mess again. This time I just leave her alone. Our  country has a curfew that starts at 10pm and ends 4am. So this guy can't leave until 4 am. So I wake her at at 5 and tell her to send the dude home and clean the kitchen. She send him home but her \"cleaning\" was just....I just cleaned instead.\n\n\nAnyway, dad comes back for 4days then he now leaves to join my mom. I ask my sister for 1 week, where I can be comfortable in my own home with out her boyfriends!! She agrees. But as soon as my dad leaves, that night, she invites one of them over and he has been here for the past 4 days. I simply asked her for 1 week out of 4 and she couldn't even respect that. So now I'm wondering why am I being so accommodating to her when she's being selfish. So I'm contemplating snitching on her."

I didn\u2019t want to share a room with my mom because privacy so i took over a small section in the living room to make my room. So about 4 or 5 months ago my sister(f29) and BIL(m29), lets call him O, moved in with us do to the fact that my sister was pregnant and they couldn\u2019t afford their previous apartment with all of the expenses, they told us that it was only going to be for about 2 months. I let them have my \u201croom\u201d so that they could have the privacy since a baby was coming in about a month or 2. Well things went downhill O started seeing someone and my sister knew because apparently he was polygamous all of the sudden. It all started going a bit downhill of the fact that O didn\u2019t want to work the only reason he did was because they realized a baby was coming and they did not prepare at all, so he did food delivery. My mom and i didnt demand rent or any of that because we wanted them to be able to get back on their feet and be able to find their own place. After my nephew was born he stayed with my sister fir about 2 hours and left her at the hospital to go hang out and spend the night with his girlfriend. Sister was obviously not happy and then from there their relationship took a toll for the worst. About a month ago my sister told him that she did not want him to see the side chick anymore because he was only seeing his son 1 or 2 days out of the week for about and hour ir so and spend the rest of the days with his side chick. About 3 weeks ago he decided to leave my sister and his child to go live in Oregon but then when he got there he calls my sister to tell her that he regrets it and that he wants her and that he dropped the girl completely. He stays there for a week and comes back. Now not even a week later my sister found messages of them texting each other of how much they cant wait to get away from my sister and her drama and go back to Oregon. My sister is furious and kicks him out. He called my sister a few days ago and he kept begging that he changed this time and that he realized his mistake and he wants to be a family with her. I don\u2019t want him here and neither does my mom. But my sister tell us that he promises to change and that hell do whatever to make us change our minds like pay rent and what not. I feel like id be an asshole because he is my sisters husband and he is the father of my nephew.i forgot to mention that when they first moved in he had a cat and dog and they ruined my carpet because, the cat especially, they would have accidents almost every day and it would not be cleaned until my mom or i got home from work. And when he left he left my room a complete and utter mess. There was trash, bottles, cans with and without liquids in it, and it took me about 12+ hours to just clean. The carpet still smells like cat pee."

We had a baby at the beginning of the pandemic and it was really hard being forced into isolation as new parents (neither of us had any childcare experience). \nSome back story with my parents: my dad was a really loving father, but was gone having to travel for work a lot when I was a kid. He married my step mom when I was in high school and her and I were really close (before you ask, my bio mom wasn't the best to me when dad wasn't home and there was no cheating on either party). He still travels all the time and my step mom owns her own business that's pretty successful. \nWe used to spend a lot of time with them, but we've felt less and less comfortable with them over time. 1) we're not seeing eye to eye politically (I don't need to agree with people about everything, but they constantly challenge us) and 2) we felt pretty unsupported after our son was born. \nMy SM said she would watch him once a week for us before he was born, but will actually only watch him twice a month. When I pick him up from these visits more often than not sure needs me to leave immediately so she can go have lunch with a friend or do something else. I barely spend time with her. Yet over the past year she's gone to visit her daughter for over 2 months altogether to see her granddaughter. She claims to love our kids equally. I can hardly get her to pick up the phone or spend time with me. Her watching my son is important because I'm still in college and only work part time. \nMy dad is gone at least half the year now days and we just aren't close anymore. We used to be two peas in a pod but now I feel like he sees me just because I'm his daughter. Both him and SM are not very emotionally intelligent (last year I struggled with PPD and PP Psychosis and they just didn't understand why I felt that way). \nThey've helped us financially over the years like buying baby things (we don't ask for money). I recently found out that while my step siblings were in college my SM gave them ~$300/month to buy groceries. My dad gave me 100-200 a month my first year of college, but stopped when I got married. And he knew we were struggling so much our first year and a half of marriage financially. It's not even about the money, it's that I feel like my step siblings (all are older than me) are more important than I am to them these days. \n\nIdk. Would I be wrong for explaining why I'm hurt and maybe taking some time back away from them? I don't feel entitled to their time or money, I'm just tired of pretending we still have a close relationship or that I'm important to them."

            "text": "Recently, I (29 F) was out for the day with my family. We went for lunch after an exhausting morning (one of those days where everything goes wrong). So I was kind of on edge. This is probably a good time to mention that I'm autistic.\n\nWe're at a tourist attraction with a few food places next to each other- two proper restaurants and one canteen where you can get pre-packaged sandwiches, etc. I have a lot of food-related sensory issues. We checked the menu of the restaurants before coming out, and we thought it was fine; but that was just a sample menu, and in fact there was nothing. \n\nI decided the best thing to order a side dish I *could* eat, and then go to the canteen after for a sandwich. I admit I wasn't delighted, but I was already tired and it was only lunchtime; I just wanted to get on with it. Mum wasn't happy with that solution, though. She could see I was upset and wanted to ask the waitress if they could do the dish from the sample menu. I said no. I find my pickiness embarrassing and hate having to ask for off-menu items. Where I'm at on the spectrum it\u2019s sometimes very visible that I am the way I am, and I'm not ashamed but it\u2019s tiring to be visible- sometimes I just don't want to draw attention to myself, even if only in a small way.\n\nMum says it\u2019s not a big deal, we'll just ask, if they say no it's no problem. I say I know it's not a big deal, but I don\u2019t want to negotiate with the waitress about what I can and can't eat; I just want to order a side. Mum continues to say it's fine. I say no. She lets it go, and I assume we\u2019re done.\n\nThe waitress came, and you guessed it: mum asked about ordering off-menu.\n\nI honestly cannot tell you how overwhelmed I felt. Is it silly? Probably, but I didn\u2019t expect her to completely overrule my choice like that.\n\nThe waitress ends up offering me something off the children's menu, which I accept because at this point the alternative is to make a fuss. After the waitress left I went to the bathroom and let myself have a freakout for a minute or two. Then I went back and ate my goddamn lunch. Yes, it was better than the side dish would\u2019ve been. I also spent the rest of the day partially nonverbal, and had to leave early later on to avoid a meltdown.\n\nI sent mum a text after saying that I am an adult capable of making my own decisions, and that her overriding my choices- even if she thinks they're wrong- is not advocating for me. She sent back 'I know, I'm sorry, it's just I thought it would be okay \\[heart emoji\\]'.\n\nShe feels it wasn\u2019t a big deal to ask, and I got a proper meal, so it turned out okay. I feel it's infantilising to make that decision for me after I've said I didn't want her to, and if we'd done it my way I wouldn't have been so stressed after.\n\nI tried to bring it up with her but she doesn\u2019t get it, and continuing to talk about it when she clearly thinks it\u2019s resolved makes me feel petty and childish. And maybe it is. She does mean well, but I just want to be allowed to make my own choices."

Covid isn't completely gone, so lot of us would prefer to continue to work from home. \n\nMy office has requested that one person from each team should be present in the office everyday. Each team has 4 people (Me, Anna, Becca, Carla). The easiest internal solution was for one person to go for a week and then rotate.\n\nThis policy was implemented few months ago. I am married and childfree while everyone else in my team are parents. Carla has 3 kids under 5 and her husband left her recently. Schools haven't opened and childcare is expensive.

Apparently, Becca has also left the team recently and this has forced Carla to come to the office more. \n\nShe accused me of trying make her go broke and ruin her life (she had to move in with her mom) because I hate her because she is a mom and that I was selfish and I had no empathy. \n\nI am ignoring her but I am planning to go to the HR if this behavior continues. \n\nAITA here?"

In the group of items was one that was more of a collectors item but also had deep sentimental value due to a secret tradition my dad and I had..  My dad passed a while ago now so inquired about the items only to find out they are no longer at the house but rather the other sibling has.\n\nThe estate management has been a free for all of two siblings taking things...but it comes down to my sibling has. Rather than challenging it and starting any arguments,  I sent a message telling my sibling I would like to purchase the item and explained the secret tradition my dad and I had related to it and to name any price even thousands for what is probably a $300 item.  My sibling responded stating that my dad specifically gave him that item.  I have my doubts given what my dad said to me, but since I don't know for sure, I said I understand not wanting to part with it.  I then said since the item obviously has deep meaning for me as well, could WE bring to a professional photographer so I could get really good pictures of the item.  My sibling told me that since the item was given to him (which again I am not sure is true given what my dad told me) that I am rude and insensitive for my request and that taking the pictures ruins how special the item is for him.  I really thought my request was reasonable given it is special to both.  AITA for asking to do the pictures?"

It took several breakups before it actually stuck. One happened around six months ago, when we said this wasn't working and would continue as friends. However, boundaries became vague again and it was only 2 months ago that we had another bad fight and a conversation that was really definitive. For me at that point, it broke my heart that it had come to that, but I was mostly relieved. She had a harder time. We promised we'd try to stay friends and be there for each other. She doesn't have a lot of other people so I promised that I would still try to help her and give her space to heal.\n\nSince then I've met a guy and we became good friends. It was only very recently that we realized that there might be a chance more between us, and he asked me on a date which will be in a few weeks, and I said yes. I considered whether I'm ready to start dating, but I feel that I am. Although I still love my ex in a lot of ways, I'm completely over the romantic relationship. Honestly, the whole situation when it was still going on had become so draining that I feel like the real grieving already happened before the final breakup. He's also pretty much aware of my past. \n\nI told my ex about the date, because I didn't want to lie to her. She completely flipped and said al bunch of horrible things, saying that it's not fair to her that I'm not giving her more time and that it's cruel and not normal to start dating so soon, and that I've just found another person to fixate on (I have ADHD). I get that she's hurt, I really do. I'm just done with basing my choices around her feelings and letting her be dependent on me. But at the same time I feel really guilty because yes, it is fast, and she doesn't have a lot of close friends beside me. I'm also worried that this situation is going to break up our friend group.\n\nAITA?\n\n(I'd appreciate no reposts because the situation is pretty specific)"

We have an 8 year age difference.  \nWe both entered the relationship with an understanding of what that would mean and we have tried to make it our goal to end up married ourselves one day with our own place and two of her children that if all things where eventually dealt with we could possibly gain custody of. She used to live in the same house with her husband and we still would see each other.  \n\n\nWe have been through a lot. Since February of this year she has moved out and has made steps to get an apartment, though she currently lives with family as she gets savings enough to do so. She has never had custody of the kids because her in-laws deemed them unfit as parents, and have maintained this since before their separation, though we are (or where) hopeful we might be able to earn custody over them. Since she has moved out on February communication has dropped off significantly, and though this is understandable my SO also works a night shift IT job with a laptop, a tablet or until recently being \"dropped in the pool\" a phone, but it takes days for a response. We used to communicate via text and other means every day. I can manage a lot but I cant manage when I haven't heard from someone in so long. I called to ask if I could go to a party and after no response I eventually went to that same party with some friends that I knew back from college and found myself in a very uncomfortable situation with a guy and after getting out of it and managing to walk myself home while drunk I attempted to reach out to them and got nothing. I've tried to contact them for the following three days and got nothing.  I've attempted to vent my frustrations and I've gotten nothing back for almost a week.  \n\n\nI'm not entirely sure why, or what made me do it but I snapped for the communication and accused them of cheating without any actual evidence but a gut feeling."

            "text": "  I took over managing a small apartment complex almost a year ago when it was bought by a relative of mine. All of the units were originally stated as empty, but less than a week before escrow closed, one unit was rented by the former management company. They collected deposits, prorated rent w/o informing the new owner or turning over any $.  I wouldn't have rented to them if it had been up to me. They were in the process of a divorce six month before moving in, made horrible accusations against the other, then when their children were taken, they reconciled. Wife works but has a poor rental history, so couldn't get accepted for the lease from the management, and husband is unemployed. They used her income and his record to get accepted. She wasn't even on the original lease.  They are nice enough to my face, but do things behind my back without permission. She works two jobs that I know of and spends most of her time at her parents. He is very house proud and keeps making \"repairs\" to the house and property, most without my permission, all violating his lease. He dug out the shared lawn and replanted, but it has been several months and it is still not growing in.He stops other tenants from walking down the driveway past his car, insisting they walk around to use the other gate instead.  He said he was a contractor and offered to fix my water heater.. We made a verbal agreement that I would buy all the parts and take a couple hundred off his next month's rent for labor. He said it should only take a few hours, but he took weeks, left stuff undone, kept keys to my storage areas, insisted the permits were  $1.5K when the the city said it was $100. He demanded another five times what we had agreed to taken off his rent. I said no, we agreed to a price and that was all I was allowing off the rent. I then told him the owner had said that I couldn't make deals for rent like that w/o approval, so there would be no more work for him through me.  He started saying he had repaired things in his house, and wanted reimbursed. I asked to see receipts. He would show me screen shots from his phone. I told him I needed paper receipts, he said he would get them for me but hasn't, so I didn't pay.  He has been passive aggressive, using the storage room keys to tamper with things, locking gates, watering the grass until it is only mud when he knows I need to pass through soon. Turning on sprinklers when I or other tenants take trash past the yard. He rewired the sprinklers so he can control them from his phone and they turn on at random times when I or other tenants are outside only to turn off as soon as we go in.    Their lease is up in a few months and I am strongly considering not renewing it so I can have tenants in there who will follow the rules and are honest with me. Would I be an AH if I did?"

            "text": " A few weeks ago, my friend and I (both F29) bought cheap plane tickets for a 3-day trip abroad. With the trip approaching, there are news of forest fires and extreme temperature warnings at our destination. I flagged it to my friend, telling her I am very paranoid about fires (I have recurring dreams about being injured in a fire although I have never experienced it, no clue what that's based in) and asked her if she would mind changing our destination to someplace closer to home considering that we hadn't managed to book our accommodation yet. She insisted we try to book a place with a cancelation policy allowing us to cancel last minute and wait and see how the situation evolves. A few days later extreme temperature warnings are still in place, a state of emergency has been declared, etc. I can read news in the local language and I have shared my sources with her, and although there's no specific warning for tourists the area we're going to is on high alert for extreme weather. I reiterate my fear, apologize for it possibly being irrational, and tell her that if she's OK with postponing or changing the destination I will absolutely pay for her plane ticket to our original destination that would go to waste (it wasn't expensive so I'm more than happy to cover it, it wasn't even an offer but a statement) and we can still cancel the hotel. She's telling me that she understands people can have irrational fears but she's sure the media is exaggerating, that there will be plenty of tourists and it's totally fine, that our home country is really warm as well and so on. She's refusing to cancel the hotel booking and is trying to make me change my mind.\n\nI may be the asshole because she doesn't seem to want to change the plan and she is right to want her holiday to go as originally planned. I realize we are unlikely to get caught in a forest fire and that in case of extreme heat we could probably stay indoors. I feel for that and I'm really torn.\n\nTo me, it seems irrational to deliberately go into an area that is on high alert + experiencing fires that I specifically have a fear of and will be nervous about, and risk getting stuck in a shabby hotel room with no AC to avoid the heat if we can make a change to our plan with minimal inconvenience and only a small financial loss to only me (since I said I would pay for her ticket). It's a relatively easy trip to take and can easily be done on another long weekend in the future and not a once in a lifetime trip that we're planned for ages. AITA for wanting to cancel?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n tl;dr I want to cancel or alter a trip planned with a friend because I'm scared of extreme weather warnings at destination, she insists it's fine because it's full of tourists and is probably fine."

Because I only  start my first job in September, I live on my savings account for the  time being. My boyfriend (together for almost 5 years) still has to  study for 1 year and would move in with me in September. His parents pay  his student dorm and would therefore pay me rent from September  onwards. Maybe this is relevant: I was given a lot of furniture by  relatives or I already had it. Because of this we only had to buy a sofa  and a washing machine, which we bought together.\n\nFor the actual problem: the agreement was that my boyfriend would  officially move in with me starting in September, but he has been  staying here since the end of June. Since I have no income at the, I pay  all utilities (water, gas/electricity, wifi, etc) with my savings  account. Food/ household items I pay up font and his parents pay me back  his share every few days. Would I be an asshole if I asked my bf (and  therefore his parents) to start paying for his share of the expenses  this summer? It bothers me that I have to pay for everything when I am  not working yet. The deal was that his parents start to pay me a certain  amount monthly that will cover all the expenses and some extra. But my  bf doesn\u2019t see this as rent, as he find is weird to ask his parents to  pay me so he could live with me. Therefore, in his opinion, everything  extra (= amount of money \u2013 cost of utilities) needs to be used for  one-time expenses (e.g. purchase of smoke detectors, installation costs  for wifi,\u2026). These things have already been purchased and will therefore  be reimbursed to me in the course of the next few months with the rent  money.\n\nWe already had a talk about  the expenses this summer and that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that I need  to pay for everything, which causes me a lot of stress as I struggle to  keep my head above water. He thought it was unfair to ask his parents  for \u201cdouble rent\u201d as his student dorm contract end at the start of  September. Since I\u2019ll receive more rent money than just the household  expenses, I'll be reimbursed for the costs of this summer after a few  months. But I don\u2019t think this is logical/fair that I need to maintain  his expenses. I\u2019m not asking for the total rent money that was  discussed, just his share of the utilities for this summer.\n\nSo  would I be the AH if I ask for his share again? Every time I bring it  up, he gets defensive and starts asking me if I want him to move back  home for the summer. To be clear, this is not what I want. I just don't  want to use the last of my savings to pay for his share.\n\nExtra  info: the discussed rent money is the same as his dorm. So the price is  not close to what his share of the rent would be if I rented the flat  and he moved in."

Ellen and her date leave for their day trip, husband and I pack and clean up, then leave the cabin with the key inside. \n\nWe drive the 4 hours home.  6 hours later Ellen calls me and says that the cabin is locked and the key is inside.  Now I am confident that I didn't lock the door but cannot be positive, which is why I'm asking this question. \n\nI live 4 hours away and don't have a spare key, the rest of my extended family live 2+ hours away.  Ellen and her date have all of their clothes, bedding, etc. inside the locked cabin and no one can bring them a key tonight (its now 9pm).  \n\nI call my Dad who is 1/3 owner and he says that it has happened before and that they can just push the window air conditioner in (floor level) and unlock the door, get their things, etc. He just requested that they please be careful.  I pass on the message and then get a call 20 minutes later that they accidentally broke the window while essentially breaking into my family cabin.\n\nI'm like okay, yeah that sucks but we can fix it, please be careful climbing in the window, clean up the glass and tape up the window until I can get up there to fix the window.  No big deal, like a $100 repair.\n\nNow, my husband and I are planning on making the 8-hour round trip this upcoming Friday to repair the window. \n\nEllen asked if we are going to expect money for the window and when I explained that yes, that seems entirely reasonable to me since she broke it, Ellen is extremely unhappy and no longer wants to be friends.\n\nAlthough I know the repair is not super expensive ($100) at the most, I figured since my husband and I are taking an entire day to travel, pay for gas and repair the damage asking for her to cover the materials seems reasonable. I feel like my Dad gave her permission to push the air conditioner in, not break the window.  I don't want to lose a 20 year friendship over this so I could use some advice."

            "text": "I (26F) have been experiencing health issues caused by stress due to working 18 hours a day for 2 years with almost no days off, which resulted in panic attacks, migraines that cause temporary blindness and a weakened immune system.\n\nI had to get an MRI, my bf (36M) came to visit me \"for support\". During the night he slept spreading as much as humanly possible, both hands and legs (he is also very fat, so there was even less space) as well as letting a grown Doberman sleep in the bed with us (which we never do) and I was pushed into a cold wall. During the night I asked him 4 times total to put his hands and legs to himself because I've no space, he didn't seem to care. On top of that he spent the whole night snoring. I have not fallen asleep at all. At 9 AM I said out loud \"Name, can you PLEASE stop snoring?\" in an irritated tone, which resulted in him leaving to another room.\n\n  \nI simply assumed that I woke him and it was 9AM already, so.. he just got up. His attempts to not let me have any further sleep followed. He would barge in and let the dog in closing the bedroom door so that the dog wouldn't let me sleep. He did that multiple times after I let the dog out. I thought it was petty, but he has been doing things to hurt me when he is annoyed, so I didn't think much of it. He spent the day not talking to me, being very cold and refusing every attempt I made to have small talk or figure out what happened.   \n\n\nEventually he told me that he expects an apology for the way I spoke to him, I was reluctant at first because I don't think that I did anything wrong, I was feeling annoyed because he didn't move and I asked him 4 times during the night, but I understand that my tone could've hurt his feelings, so I apologised for it. To which he said it was not sincere, so I apologised again, this time hugging him. He once again told me I'm just telling him what he wants to hear and I don't mean it, that escalated into him screaming at me that I can't be rude to him, if I think I can then I can F\\*ck off, F\\*ck me. He was very rude and aggressive which started the worst panic attack I have ever had, he didn't seem to care that I was unable to catch my breath, was very dizzy and crying, I left and went to lay down, the panic attack lasted 2+ hours after which I just fell asleep due to how exhausted it left me. \n\nAround 9PM I asked whether he could take the dog out, which he did. When he came back he made a scene about leaving, calling me a stupid c\\*nt. I asked him why he would call me that to which he responded mockingly \"because you are a stupid c\\*nt\". Blamed me for sleeping whole day, after telling him that I was feeling bad so I took a nap he said he doesn't give a sh\\*t about how I feel nor what medical conditions I have. Like an idiot I begged him to stay and talk. He left by saying that it is my fault he called me all those names.\n\nAITA?"

It has been in our family for a long time. my father grew up their too. They are willing to sell it to me and my brother for less than market price, enough to pay off most of their debt. we want to take up on this offer but we both are stretched financially. \n\nMy wife has a pretty decent income but she is not happy with her field. She grew up in a household which a lot of emphasis on scoring good marks and getting into a STEM career track. She has done that even though she didn't know if that is what she wanted to do, she didn't have much of a choice .  she picked up Photography as hobby in college and she really wants to try her hand at professional photography.  She is a very methodical person and has done her research on it and understands that it is extremely competitive industry where you really have to pay the dues before you start to make money. \n\nI make enough money that I can provide for both of us but we will have to make sacrifices but we are do ready to do it as this is something she wanted to do for a long time and I have faith that she will hustle and work hard to set up a business. If it doesn't work, it would suck but I don't want her to regret not trying it.  \n\nThe issue is my brother found out about it and He thinks that I am being a idiot here an buying the house would be a better investment and at the same time allow us to keep it in the family. He thinks we are making the wrong choice here. \n\nI understand why he is frustrated. This house means a lot to us. It really does. I feel like an asshole as I don't really want to discuss this it and have been curt with him. I feel like he is losing something valuable and I am shrugging it off. He won't stop bringing it up and they are planning to list it in the market soon enough. My parents also did right by us and I feel guilty about not paying it back by helping keeping the house in the family. My dad is also feeling pretty about selling it but he knows they have no other option."

I have a bad relationship with my mother that started when I was a baby. When I came out and went blind, our relationship got worse. I grew up in her house. but she was afraid of being touched, so we never had any physical parent/child relationship, and me being blind, meant i found it easy to dissociate her existence, like a ghost. She blames me for murdering her child and we generally disagree on most subjects.\n\nRecently she has been trying to connect to me by watching movies together. I did this once or twice but didn't stay in the room because I was bored, so I came in and out while doing other stuff. when she questioned me on it. I told her that I need audio description if she wants me to watch the film properly. She does not like audio description because the voice annoys her and said that I am just trying to make it impossible for her to do anything with me.\n\nshe has tried a few other things to connect with me but I shut them down, these were. shopping, which I have always hated. cooking, which i prefer to be alone for. and make-up, i am a man and i have an allergy to makeup (found out on Halloween lol).\n\nShe likes superhero films, like the hardest films to follow for blind people even with good audio description. she won't watch anything with lgbt characters. or disabled characters, because she watched a really offensive film about disability, began advocating for disabled people to not live and i lost it at her. If I leave the descriptions to her, she just repeats what they are saying, not tells me where they are or what they're doing. So that is not an option.\n\nshe tried again last night, i said i'm not watching anything without audio description. she flipped out saying i don't always use audio description so why do i need it now. (I don\u2019t use audio when I have tv on as background noise) so i said \u201cok i won't use audio, but my partners have to be invited so they can give me the context\u201d. I Knew this would be an issue for her, she said my partners together \u201ccreep her out, because it makes her think of orgies\u201d i find this ridiculous and her problem. So I said I won't watch anything with her until she finds a solution in which we can both watch it. She said I never liked her and brought other (personal) stuff up. I pointed out I was a baby and therefore it was her responsibility to be a mother or give me up if you can\u2019t even touch me. (which left me with an attachment disorder, i barely have emotions for others, partners excluded) my sister raised me, she is only 7 years older.\n\nShe is trying and I could just pretend to watch the film without the audio, but I get so bored. And I am an adult now. My partners are split 2:1 on my side, but one thinks I should have just stayed in the room and been on my phone or something.\n\nNow she thinks I'm TA for starting this over a movie. And IDK I might be TA for it."

And English isn't my first language, so excuse my mistakes.\n\n\nFew days ago, I got a call from unknown number and it turned out to be my dad's friend who isn't VERY close to my dad. He talks with my brother (I guess) and got to know that I'm planning to study abroad after finishing College in my country( I did call my brother after that and gave him an earful). It seems like he wants his daughter to study abroad (Just for name sake) and wanted me to decide on where I'm going and what I'm going to study  so that he can send his daughter with me to study together. He also mentioned her daughter doesn't mind whatever course I pick because she isn't into studying that much and just wants to have some fun.\n\nFyi, I still have one year left till I complete my college and I haven't thought of next steo even though it's time for me to start preparing something like GMAT,IELTS/TOEFL.\n\nHe offered to send me videos and info about different courses which I didn't want to initially but since he compelled me, I thought he was just trying to help and it wouldn't hurt to learn more about programs which might suit me. \n\nThen, He started to call me everyday (2-3 times per day, I ignore sometimes)and asked if I made my decision. Again, I guess I have enough time so I didn't want to finalize yet.  He also started to convince me into Counseling services and much more stuffs which I wasn't interested in. I politely told him that I'm already consulting someone else and I'm not interested in what he is sending me. Soon, I felt like he was pressuring me and not helping actually. So I decided not to take his calls and respond to any of his texts. \n\nInstead, he called and told my dad about everything and asked him to make me make decisions soon. My parents aren't pressuring me (which is a good thing, since I get anxious very easily and he's making me very anxious, which Is another reason why I'm avoiding his calls) but my dad is wanting me to talk to him again just to escape his calls. If I don't pick up his calls, he instantly calls my dad and talk for a long time(which annoys my dad too but doesn't wanna say). \n\nMy dad wants me to deal with him myself. Mind you, I haven't even talked with him before even though he claims that he came to my home one time( maybe I forgot) but, still it doesn't give him rights to talk/ pressure  me like this."

            "text": "A bit of background, I live in a relatively safe neighborhood. I've been living in this neighborhood for around a year now. Occasionally I would go on a stroll around the neighborhood with my spouse after dinner. There is this huge mansion that is for sale for a couple million dollars recently that is at the end of a \"shallow\" culdesac in our neighborhood. We would sometimes walk into the culdesac to take a peek at the mansion during our walk.\n\nSo this week - We decided to go on a stroll once again after dinner along with a friend to take a peek at the mansion while we're at it. While we were walking into the culdesac, we passed by the backyard fence of one of the mansion's neighboring houses. Some noises came out of the backyard and then we saw a barefoot man storming out of his backyard looking at us. It startled me but then I didn't think of anything and kept walking.\n\nCouple seconds later we arrived in front of the mansion. We stood on the road looking at it and chatted for a minute or so. Then we turned back to walk out of the culdesac. We saw the barefoot man still standing there in front of his backyard gate. It was until I walked a bit closer to him that I saw that he had a camera, and was whispering something to himself. A bit confused and uncomfortable, I stared at the barefoot man, thinking whether I should confront him. \n\nWhile doing so, we were still walking towards him (the direction of existing the culdesac). That may have made him uncomfortable, he asked out loud: \"What do you think you guys are doing?\". I was thinking how I should respond to this sudden question. The silence made him roll his eyes and repeat his question.\n\nThis time I responded with: \"Looking at the house?\", while pointing at the mansion. Again, he rolled his eyes, and asked me: \"Is that your house?\".  I replied: \"Uh, no?\"\n\nRolled his eyes once again, he said: \"Don't be so fucking weird next time\". Then went back to his backyard. Something about this snapped in me, not sure if it was all the eye rolling, or the fact he used the phrase \"fucking weird\", I raised my voice and asked if the road was private property. The road was a public road as far as I know with a legit street sign. At this point there was a fence and some small trees in between us. He replied that his house and the mansion are private properties, and just don't be so weird next time. I then yelled what the f and told him to f off. Not sure if he said anything else but we just walked away.\n\nNow thinking about it, he may had just been a very cautious neighbor looking out for supicious behaviours. He was filming just in case given there were 3 of us and he was on his own. I may have made him feel like a jerk for being cautious by yelling at him.\n\nWas our behaviour actually considered weird/suspicious? AITA for yelling and swearing at him?"

I told him he could do it as long as he paid me a little bit (I literally asked for $2 just because I wanted to grab something from the vending machine) and he wasn't uploading pictures of girls who he doesn't know, because I thought that was really weird. Anyway, I went grab my snack from the vending machine, and when I came back I saw pictures of all these young girls on my laptop. \n\nThis is where I may be the AH. I yelled at him to take those pictures girls (some from are class) off of my laptop, and ripped the sd card out of the computer. He got super embarrassed, and everyone in the room was looking and staring at both of us. We have some mutual friends who said it was a dick move to make such a public seen about something that seemed minor. I explained the whole story and some are on my side but still said I should've been nicer about it. \n\nSo AITA?"

            "text": " \n\nWe were at a very well-known department store, famous for oddballs and freak outs. Me and my 12 year old daughter were sitting at the benches at the front where the tills are. She noticed a lady with a leashed dog with vest on. Definitely not a seeing-eye dog, but a service dog for support, no doubt.\n\nMy daughter has seen seeing-eye dogs before on the bus and other places. She knows not to pet them or distract them in any way. Those dog owners never had a problem with her talking about the dogs. She's never gone up to anyone to ask about their working dogs.\n\nIt was the same thing in this case. She asked me if this dog is a working dog and what the different coloured vest means (it wasn't red or a colour my daughter recognized for working dogs), and asked me if the store allows dogs. She wasn't very loud, but audible enough, as the store is loud. Just normal kid questions (my daughter also has an intellectual disability, in case anyone thinks 12 years is wise enough to know about working animals and the laws.) I answered her questions, diplomatically and reminded her that, yes, the dog is working so you have to leave it be. We were still seated and just people watching.\n\nThe dog owner snapped at us \"Don't distract my dog. It's a service dog and you can't distract her.\" And then tried to get her dog under control as it was starting to walk ahead of her and in front of her.\n\nUmm... Now I've heard of some service dog owners getting upset over kids even looking at their dogs, talking about them. I know some issues are sensitive, so I was careful of what I was saying and give general answers. I had seen videos online previous to that incident of the struggles those with service animals face. I know they are allowed pretty much anywhere and there are an array of reasons to have a dog assigned to you, even if it's not physically obvious. Since my daughter has an intellectual disability and mood disorders she had been thinking if a service animal would benefit her. That's why she was asking those seemingly pointed questions.\n\nI didn't film this incident as it was such a quick escalation. The lady stormed off right away, not sticking around, thank goodness. It had happened a long time ago but still bugs me today and I don't know if my daughter was in the wrong and I was in the wrong for allowing her to look at the dog. It's a public, crowded place. People are going to look. Children are curious.\n\nAI still TA?"

            "text": "My best friend (14f) and I (14m) used to be so close with each other.  We were like bread and butter, peanut butter and jelly, we just clicked together.  We talked to each other a lot, in school and over snap.  I was in a friend group of two other people as well, and we would often hangout with each other.\n\nOne day, however, she wouldn\u2019t answer my snaps.  I thought to myself that it must be a one time thing because we would take hours of our day talking to each other.  She responded to my snap the following day saying \u201cI was just really busy and didn\u2019t really snap anyone at all yesterday.\u201d  I believed her, but it dragged on and on.  One day would turn into two, two into three, and so on and so forth.  During that time, we couldn\u2019t hang out as well.  (One of our friends was on vacation.)\n\nAfter about a month of her taking days to respond, I asked if I could talk to her about it over the phone, but she said she couldn\u2019t talk because she was out with other friends ALL WEEK and that I should text it to her.  I waited until the night to see if she was available and she said no.  It got me quite confused/angry because I thought that if she cared enough, she would take just a few minutes out of her day to talk to me.  The next time we hung out with our friend group, she sort of treated me like a friendly stranger.  We had a few conversations, all of them started my me.  The next day, I sent her a lengthy text telling her about the way I felt.  I told her that I always am putting so much effort, energy, time, and care into our friendship and, as of recently, I\u2019ve only gotten an iota of that back.  At the end of the message though, I said something that I regret.  I said that I\u2019ve been thinking of cutting her off.  I think that at the time of me writing the text, I was just sad, confused, angry, and lost.  It just felt like she didn\u2019t care about our friendship at all anymore.  \n\nIn response, she sent a text saying how she values our friendship a lot, and she doesn\u2019t know why I would cut her off.  I responded with an apology about how I would never cut her off, and I acted out of line, along with some other things.  Day by day, I was turning from a friend, to a complete stranger.  The next time we hung out, she didn\u2019t even make eye contact with me.  \n\nAfter that day, I sent a long message asking her to tell me if she doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore.  I told her how it hurts to see yourself become an afterthought to a best friend.  In her reply, she said how she just needed some time.  I told her to take all the time she needs.  This was about a week ago.  Since then, I\u2019ve seen her post stories of her having a great time with her girl friends multiple times.  I\u2019ve broken down several times because all I can think about is the countless memories I\u2019ve created with her and how they seem to hold zero value to her anymore.\n\nAITA, and do I have any right, for feeling mad/sad?"

Im from india and preparing for the JEE examination, my schedule is very busy and my dad thinks im playing games on a 3 year old laptop which can only run youtube in my room. And privacy is not a concept in india.\n\nHere is what has been happeneing recently, i go to my room and start studying, i close the door as shut as possible , my door doesn't have a bolt/lock. I have no problem with my mom or brother coming into my room but my dad just barges straight into my room (mom and bro atleast knock) and asks me if im playing games, when i say no he asks if im hiding something in the background. I dont have a problem with this behavious but he does this in the middle of the day when im studying and it pisses me off, i asked him to stop but he wont and asks me to keep the door open, i try to make him understand that it demotivates me to sttudy but no he doesn't care. So i do it my way. I had 15k INR saved from past few birthdays with my mom so she obviously gives me my money and agrees to let me buy a lock. So i bought a door bolt and installed it with power tools and when my dad got to know he was pissed. He basically screamed \"TAKE THAT OFF OR ELSE ILL BREAK THE DOOR WHEN I NEED TO COME IN\" (My room has a small attactched bathroom and nothing else so the family has no reason to come in). Then i tell him if he breaks it then i won't study, no lock no study, he goes away being pissed. Later that day when im studying with the door locked he bangs the door so hard i jump out of my chair. He yells \"WHY IS LOCKED, OPENNNNN\". So i go to the door and talk to him, \"why should i open\", he said \"i want to see what you are doing\", and then i tell him \"you can see what i did today at the end of the day\" and he keeps threatening me but i go back to my chair and continue sttudying with headphones on. Problem is im used to studying with music on but mine dont have noise cancelling so i could still hear him when he yells. I told my brother and mom if they want to come in they should call me on my phone because i cant hear anything. And my dad wont stop yelling so i spent the rest of my saving on a sony headset with Active Noise Cancellation. they work really well and now i can study in peace but my dad hates me and gives me the looks everytime im going to study and says \"yeah go play games useless kid\". I feel terrible at heart but i had to do it to get good grades. AITA?"

He and I started dating after I returned from overseas, and I entered the relationship knowing that he had possibly gotten a girl pregnant. He has been a saint in regards to this woman (who does not treat him well at all), including paying for her to move to his moms house in another state to get her off of the street. She has moved back to our state and gave birth in a different state on her way back. My boyfriend is not on the BC. \n\nSince my boyfriend knows she was cheating on him while they were together, and thought he was infertile, a paternity test is a necessity. I have offered to pay for it if her insurance doesn\u2019t cover it because he doesn\u2019t have the funds, and he has to PCS soon. I have made it clear to him that my investment in this child depends on paternity. If it\u2019s positive then I will be 100% invested, but if it\u2019s negative I would like for him to stop being in baby mama\u2019s life because I have been battling insecurity due to my past\n\nMy boyfriends car has a mechanical issue and often requires a jump. I was of the understanding that he was taking it to carmax and possibly sell it today. His baby mama also had an appt for herself and the baby, and with no job, no license/car, and no money for a rideshare she is relying on him for a ride (nobody else could take her today). As I normally allow him to borrow my car, he assumed that I\u2019d let him borrow it today, but I had to run some errands and said no, and asked why he can\u2019t use his car if he was planning on selling it right after. I know about the issue but I also know it can run and in my mind it makes sense because it\u2019s fewer trips back and forth. He borrowed a different car to take her to her appt.\n\nLater this evening he said he needed to talk with me in person, so I\u2019m assuming something came up. I told him I support him 100%, and his response was \u201cexcept when it comes to the kid\u201d. I think I\u2019m TA because I truly believe that it was a terrible idea for baby mama to go through with the pregnancy when she has no means of supporting this kid on her own, and because I asked why she can\u2019t take the bus earlier when he asked to borrow my car. I\u2019ve suggested before that it would probably be in the best interest of the child that she give it up either to my boyfriend (pending paternity) or to the system since she obviously doesn\u2019t have the means on her own to support a kid. I\u2019ve dropped that topic since, and mentioned getting a local job if I EAS so I can get a place where baby mama can live rent free to get on her feet (pending paternity), but everything about whether or not I commit on this kid depends on paternity. Which hasn\u2019t happened yet, despite my offer to pay for it in full. I\u2019m frustrated because I can\u2019t commit to this kid unless I know it is his, and I don\u2019t want to live without him. This is stressful for him and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m empathetic enough."

These cousins usually bring a bottle of nice wine, so all\u2019s good. I don\u2019t request splitting the cost of the food. In return, they usually invite us for New Year\u2019s eve, and we split the costs. OK. I can live with that because we\u2019re a bit better off financially and we have one kid when they have two.\n\nWe also invite each other several times throughout the year, where I don\u2019t split the cost, but since they usually decide to order Japanese when we go there, they inform my husband of our share of the bill and we split the cost. We always bring at least a couple of bottles of prosecco with us when we\u2019re invited to their place. We were invited on Friday night, and returning from their house, I mentioned something about not understanding why we split the bill everytime we\u2019re invited to their place for a meal. Maybe I\u2019m old fashioned, but in the country I live in, when people invite people for a meal, the host usually takes care of the cost of the meal, while the guests bring wine and/or dessert. On Friday evening, we brought a bottle of an aperitif and our usual two bottles of prosecco. My husband can\u2019t stand when I question anything on his side of the family so we ended up getting into a massive fight. So AITA for questioning why we pay our share when we go to their house?"

I am currently writing this post from an Uber to the airport so  bear with me.\n\nContext; Im in college so I live in my college town most of the time but this past week I've been visiting my home town to see friends and my dogs (my parents are out of town).\nAnyway, yesterday I was hanging out with my friend, we'll call her Jo, and I mentioned I couldn't hang out Kate bc I needed to wake up around 3:45 in order to catch the metro in time to get to the airport for my flight. Jo says that she would drive me to the airport in the morning so I could hang out later. Of course I agree and we decide that she should come by my place at 5am to give us time to get to the airport. Later in the evening she offers me to spend the night at hers so it will be easier to get to the airport in the morning, but she is also not wanting to drive me home and wait around while I shower and pack up so I decline and say I'd rather hang out with my dogs in my last night anyway. Everything seems fine I reconfirm the time in the morning, got another friend to drive me home, I set my alarm and go to sleep.\n\nFlash forward to this morning, I get up 4:45 text Jo immediately to confirm she's awake and able to come get me, no response, I don't worry immediately as I assume she's just getting ready and not staring at her phone. I continue getting ready and head downstairs. At this point it's 5am, I've called her 5 times and texted about the same, no response. Of course I am now fairly certain she's asleep and not gonna get up so I order and Uber, a $40 Uber which won't get me to the airport until 20 min past when I wanted to arrive (I'll now be at the airport 2 min before my boarding time, 30 min before my departing time).\n\nSo now to my question: I am incredibly upset, but don't know if that's justified because it was very nice of her to offer to take me to the airport so early in the morning, and she was under no obligation to do so, but at the same time of I knew she couldn't do it I would've woken up earlier and taken the metro...\nSo essentially, AITA if I go off on her? Should I just drop the subject? Would I BTA if I ask her for money? (bc I wouldn't have needed an Uber if not for her)\n\nThank you in advance :)"

She's in a nursing home right now for 2 months to give my dad, who's her caregiver, some rest and some time to go fix the damage to their second residence due to a water leak. The nursing home doesn't organise a lot of activities which results in my mother being alone in her room a lot totally confused by the new environment. My and my dad visit her every other day but he wants to go to their second residence next week for the whole week so I asked my brother if he could visit some more (he goes once a week). He told me he needs to put himself and his pregnant wife first and doesn't see the need of my mom having company every day (\"She doesn't even remember she had visitors 15 min after they are gone\"). My parents have always been there for us our whole life, giving us everything they could. I told him I thought he was very selfish as I've taken on a lot of caregiving myself over the past years and I'm only asking a little bit of effort from his side for 1 week. I know my mom forgets the visits but I also know she feels alone and if I visit her just so she doesn't feel alone all of the time. As you already read in the title, they asked me to be the Godmother of their child and I said yes but now I'm realizing that their norms and values are completely different than mine and I honestly don't want them to be a big part of my life anymore. So AITA for not wanting to be the Godmother of my brother's kid?"

            "text": "Quick background:\n\nI\u2019m a single mom and have been for a while. The few years my kids father and I lived together it was as if I had an extra kid that sometimes helped with the bills. I did absolutely everything, I left for many reasons one main on was the constant let down of being told he would do something and it never getting done. He would be extremely mad if I asked twice or reminded him in any way and if I just did it myself he would throw a tantrum and break something. \n\nI have been seeing my boyfriend for a solid 3 years and it took about a year before I would actually ask for help, he would start helping without me asking but I just couldn\u2019t ask for him for help. We maintain separate homes and do not plan on moving in together in the foreseeable future. \n\nIt is also good to know I have always been independent and done whatever I could myself becoming a Jack of many trades. \n\nCurrent situation:\n\nThis last 6 or so months my boyfriend has stopped following through when he agrees to help. This makes me feel so small and unimportant , which I communicate with him every time. Except this last time. When I struggled to install my a/c (new window mounted not portable like I usually have) on the first day of a major heat wave. He didn\u2019t even remember I had asked weeks prior to install it together until I went to his house and commented on how nice and cool it was there (central a/c). After this I decided to avoid asking him for help. Either I do it myself or I advertise a trade on the local marketplace. As I said before I like to do things myself and have mastered a few highly sought out skills. \n\nWhenever he asks me who helped me with x I am always truthful. He never once said that it. Bothered him or asked why I didn\u2019t ask him for help, until one of his friends (an electrician) offered his service with an issue I was having. My end of the trade was detailing his car, simple.\n\nMy boyfriend found out from his friend shortly after leaving my place and he is livid. Basically telling me that I cheated on him by getting his friend to help and not him. He is not mad at his friend but\n glad his friend \u201ctold me (him) the kind of person you are (I am)\u201d. His friend is on my side but doesn\u2019t want to get any further involved.  \n\nMy defence: \n\nMy ad was posted in a public market place, I did not call up his friend and ask for help he answered my ad. Plus I don\u2019t want anyone but a bonded and insured electrician messing with the wires in my home. I have never been dishonest with him and explained (again) that my time and needs are important and if he is unable or even just doesn\u2019t want to hep that he can just say that, no problem at all. He has exercised this freedom previously with no backlash from me.\n\n\nSo AITA for not asking him for help and accepting help from his friend?"

My aunt always makes sure Lara can do the extra curricular's she wants to do, she lets her drop out at any time, even if she's paid in advance, she gives her the birthday she wants every year, and in general she's more affectionate and interested in what Lara is up to. With Reese, she pushed her into dance when she was 5 and made her do dance for 4 years. Reese never liked dance and never seemed to fit in. Mara hated it. She would ask her why she couldn't put more effort in, etc. That she had always wanted a daughter who did dance. I (18f) was around there a lot because Aunt Mara babysat me for my parents while they worked and then I just had to wait at her house until my parents got home so we could save on electric bills and stuff. I once asked Aunt Mara why Reese couldn't do something she wanted to do and she told me they didn't have the money for it. Reese never got to do another one but Lara has several. Soccer, dance, art and swim right now. But she's also done basketball, photography, gymnastics (which really upset Reese because she always wanted to do gymnastics), guitar, piano, drums and singing. Aunt Mara also discards Reese's plans and has made her cancel to look after her sister but also made Reese skip her plans when Lara has them and they conflict.\n\nIn the last year and a half Reese has just decided to say fuck everyone. She's definitely weighed down by it all. We talk about it because she said I'm the only one who acknowledges it. But I  have definitely noticed.\n\nWe were all gathered for a family dinner Sunday (it was my grandparents birthday this week so the family decided to celebrate Sunday) and Reese was in a really bad mood. Aunt Mara told her she was bringing down the mood and Reese got up and left the table. Aunt Mara said she didn't know what was up with her but she's always acting like the whole world is out to get her. I mentioned that maybe if she didn't show such blatant favoritism Reese would be happier. My aunt and parents were pissed I would bring it up, my grandparents asked what I meant. Aunt Mara said I didn't know what I was talking about and Reese is such a drama queen. I told my grandparents what I meant and they were shocked. Aunt Mara said Reese never wanted to do anything. Grandma remembered how often Reese would ask to do gymnastics.\n\nMy parents told me it wasn't the correct time or place to bring it up and I embarrassed Aunt Mara.\n\nAITA?"

He\u2019s a business owner so has a cushy office and my son loves going with him. I called him midday to ask when they\u2019ll be home so I can have dinner ready etc. He said he wasn\u2019t sure and that he\u2019d let me know later on. 8pm rolled around and I tried calling and texting but both were ignored. They finally showed up close to midnight. I was fuming because I expect at least a text saying they are running late. I kind of lost it because this isn\u2019t the first time this happened, where he stays out late and doesn\u2019t let me know and it annoys me. I confronted my bf and asked why he couldn\u2019t take 2 seconds out of his day to keep me updated and he goes on about the internet being down at his shop and he had work conflicts he had to take care of.

            "text": "A little back story because I may well be out of line here because I don\u2019t like this man. A few months ago I had an electrical fault in my house and it meant that none of the electrics in my kitchen and home office area would work. I was powering my fridge with extension cables plugged into other extension cables and it was unsafe. I told my landlady and she landlady booked an electrician. I got a family friend who is an electrician to have a look and he told me this will be a big job take tomorrow off work it\u2019ll take a long time to fix. I booked the day off work and explained to his company that it\u2019s a big job and it\u2019s affecting my work and making my kitchen unable to be used so I would appreciate him coming sooner rather than later hoping it could be fixed that day. He turned up at 3pm and then realised it was a huge piece of work and he would come down the next week. This meant I was without electrics for 8 days in half of my house. His attitude stunk and he left a mess. He managed to fix the issue, albeit leaving a cantaloupe melon sized hole in the wall. I forgot all about him \n\nA month later my landlady contacts me to say that significant remedial works are required on the electrics in my house. I was annoyed. I had just taken 2 days off work for electrics, why had he not told me about it then? Why now? So I had to book a further 2 days off and he\u2019s here now doing this work.\n\nHe\u2019s currently in my porch. There\u2019s a front door and then a door behind that leads into the living room. I asked him to shut the porch door because he\u2019s got both the doors open. By shutting the porch door he can keep the front one open for light and air and space. He doesn\u2019t need them both open. He asked why and I said \u201cI\u2019m really arachnophobic and I try to keep windows and doors shut\u201d and explained that last time he came there were spiders in the house. I live alone. He became defensive about it and was like \u201cI\u2019ll stop this job right now if you want\u201d. I said \u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop the job I just want you to try to keep the doors shut\u201d. He said he can\u2019t because he\u2019s going in and out. When I\u2019m in and out for example doing the recycling I shut the door behind me. \n\nAm I the asshole for asking him to keep the doors shut?"

            "text": "Me (42f) and my partner (40m) have an on-again-off-again relationship. Neither of us is seeing anyone else, but we are very different people and have decided it would probably be better if we went our separate ways. We have been together around 8 years. Our house is quite small - downstairs we only have 2 rooms, a lounge and a kitchen. Because we only have one bedroom, we sleep in the same bed every night without any issues. I usually go to bed before him because he is a night owl and I am an early riser. \n\nThe problem occurs on the weekends when he doesn\u2019t have to get up for work. I work from home doing 9 hour shifts anywhere between 8am-8pm, with 2 1/2 weekends on shift out of every 6 weeks, while he has a normal 9-5 Monday to Friday office job. So on the weekends he often doesn\u2019t bother coming up to bed. He will stay up late either playing Xbox or just watching movies and eventually ends up falling asleep on the couch. When I get up in the mornings, whether I have work or not, I am then faced with having to creep around in the dark for several hours till he decides he wants to wake up. We only have a 2 seat couch, so if he\u2019s sleeping on there, I usually end up sitting on the floor or stairs.  Otherwise, I usually end up trying to do the cleaning as quietly as possible, because he doesn\u2019t lift a finger round the house and leaves all the chores to me. Eventually I will get fed up and ask him to please just go to bed so I can sit down, and he always gets really angry and says I should respect the fact he\u2019s sleeping and just stay upstairs till he\u2019s ready to get up. I should note that sometimes on the weekends he often doesn\u2019t get up until the middle of the afternoon. My counter argument is that the lounge isn\u2019t a bedroom, and if he wants to sleep in he should just go to bed. He says I am being controlling and have no right to tell him where he can and can\u2019t sleep. AITA?"

As the title reads so far i don't want any of my female cousins involved i know it sounds bad but none of them are interested and i have friends who i condenser family. Here's the thing most 15th are very religious with the family and court going to church before the party. I'm having a small 15th so only 3 girls will be in my court and 4 boys with one boy being my escort. The problem that many for my family has is that 2 out of 3 of my damas are not the same religion or are not religious . My bestie A is Wicca and bestie S is doesn't believe in god. I've had no problem with this and non of my damas either they all said even before i asked they will go to church for support and love and won't get blessed ( as I am catholic and in a catholic mass you get blessed) but will sit silently. My grandma let this slip to the church and the church and some of my family is saying that i must change my court or it's disrespectful to God and some of my family agreed. My mom says that she's proud i don't see religion in anyone while my dad just doesn't care as long as I'm happy on my dad. Some of my family has been telling me to add my female cousins even after i said no. One day i just blew up and said well their not paying for the party and it's my day and stop being so disrespectful to my friends who are family to me. So redit please tell me.\nAITAH \nI don't think i am but i need help"

I didn\u2019t realise how difficult this would be in reality on my finances, paying double in rent (excluding utilities).\n\nIt\u2019s now coming to the end of our lease, and they\u2019ve advised we have to pay an increase if we renew.

I\u2019m nearly finished getting my masters degree, and the last week has been one of the most difficult of my life. I almost cracked under the pressure, but I finished all my required work Saturday and Sunday I drove to visit family for the first time in a few weeks (they live about an hour drive away from us). I\u2019m very close with my family, and they know her well and it meant a lot of me to see them. Also, (important for later) she mentioned she got a new freelance gig and starts the next morning there! Awesome!!\n\nI asked if gf wants to go and she said yes, so brought her with me. Day goes great- went out to dinner, played some video games, all is well. It starts to get a little late and I can tell I\u2019m tired, family is tired, she\u2019s tired, so we wrap things up around 11:00PM. All happy and good, me and gf leave and I\u2019m quite happy. \n\nCare ride home is an hour. We\u2019re quite content for a bit and she says to me she wants to try to sleep a little to which I say okay and I turn the music down for her and we are quite for about 10. She then sits up and says she\u2019s unable to sleep; I feel bad and I tell her I\u2019m sorry and if I can do anything. She says no, and then she tells me in a more harsh tone that maybe she can squeeze a few hours sleep in, then followed that with telling me she needs to wake up at 5:30 to get to her freelance gig on time. I felt bad in the moment and asked if she was mad and she said \u201cI\u2019m pretty miffed\u201d then folded her arms and put the car into angered silence. It stayed like this the rest of the car ride, and acted angry and passive aggressive in silence getting things ready as she went to bed. \n\nAITH for staying late with family and causing her to lose some sleep before the freelance gig? I am aware I stayed with them for a while, but I was not aware of when she needed to wake up, and that she had wanted to leave. Things like this happen a lot, where she gets mad when I\u2019m not aware of things that bug her. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m inattentive to her needs, or if she doesn\u2019t communicate with me what those needs are. I\u2019m perfectly fine with learning that I\u2019m inattentive, because I can try to improve myself moving forward. I don\u2019t want to cause a rift, I want to just know how to move forward for us and to know whether the problem is with me, or her. Either way, I just want to solve it so that we can spend time loving each other and not being bitter about petty things."

It\u2019s almost an event, hot snacks or sweets with tea, everyday, twice or thrice a day, at the same times. Everyone who is in the home has a cup piping hot. I definitely partake when people around me want to drink tea, but it\u2019s not my natural inclination. Especially now - almost a half year into Invisalign. Since eating and drinking involve me taking off my trays (sometimes mildly painful, sometimes only soreness), I tend to delay my meals a bit more than I would\u2019ve before. \n\nCut to today, everyone sat down to have a small dessert before having tea, the size of a donut hole. My fianc\u00e9 and his dad were watching the Olympics and we were all just generally chatting in between. I held on to my dessert, half multitasking (we were having someone pick up furniture) half waiting for the tea to come to a boil so I could eat and drink together - and not have to take my Invisalign off/on twice. My fianc\u00e9 told me to get off my phone, and start eating since it had been 10 minutes. I explained that I\u2019d eat it, just in a few minutes. He repeated, no it had been 10m and besides, his parents had complained to him about how I take my sweet time to eat every meal, that it\u2019s rude. I explained again that I was just quickly responding to the furniture inquiry and assured him that I would start soon, that it would be nice to have it with my tea. After some back and forth of the same points, I dropped it. \n\nTonight, I tried to revisit the topic by asking him to understand that I can\u2019t eat at the will of others because of their feelings, not only because of my appetite but because it is highly inconvenient to do so (the more on and off, the more I tend to feel movement and soreness). I explained that it\u2019s upto him to insulate me from that kind of restrictive attitude because I will be wearing my trays for some time to come. (Of course, if it was a formal dinner or event or outdoors I would eat at the same time as everyone else.)\n\nIn his words, if I continue to eat at the pace and manner that I do, his mom \u201cwill think I\u2019m a bitch\u201d and \u201cThis is such a bitter and negative way to look at so many things.\u201d ..amongst other comments\n\nI know this might seem silly, but it really did put into perspective how I have to prioritize certain aspects of our relationship. \nSince he is usually pretty understanding..AITA for not eating when everyone else did?"

            "text": "So, I (14 M) live in a family of 5 and nobody really plays video games except for me, occasionally they will play but not avidly. Around Christmas of 2018?-2019? I asked for a Nintendo switch, Christmas comes around and my Mom (47 F(M)) brings out a switch for the whole family to share... I was a little salty as nobody else wanted one but I didn't really care as that meas they wouldn't use it much.\n\nFast forward a couple months and we go on a game buying spree and we end up with my oldest brother (17 M(OB)) buying breath of the wild, me buying rocket league, FNAF, and links awakening. my middle brother (15 M(MB)) bought pokemon sword and shield. We all shared these games very well, but I LOVED breath of the wild, as in I as of 2021 have over 2k hours of play time on it and I 100% the game including the DLC(he purchased the DLC also, which will become important later). The problem with this being it was my brothers game and he being an older brother and doing petty older brother things he wouldn't let me play it if I was mean to him(which is kinda fair but still a little rude).\n\nNow in 2020 he worked hard to get his own switch and he did get it so he moved all of his accounts over to his switch, this is all fine and dandy except for the fact that bc his account was the one that purchased the DLC, it took all of my breath of the wild content with it and I was so upset by this I cried bc that's how much it meant to me(but I also have trouble controlling emotions sometimes so slight overreaction) and at the time I had no idea what happened and eventually we moved on with our lives. Recently I reached out to Nintendo support and they told me that he can have his account on two devices but only one can be the primary, the difference being that the primary can use his downloaded content normally but the non-primary has to have switch online. He does pay for Nintendo witch online so I ask him if he can do this little thing for me... \"no\" so I bring it to my parents, \"hey guys I can get all of my progress back, I just need OB to do this one thing for me... can you guys help me out\", M: \"ok sure\" we go to get it sorted out and they say that he payed for it, so he shouldn't have to accommodate me(now mind you OB has been Favorited his entire life and I get piss all so I was a little upset by this but I am working on a peaceful solution). I think this is bullshit because it changes nothing for him but would mean the world to me and I was gonna fucking pay him because I wanted to repay him bring kind but no they basically said \"i know you've spent 2k hours on this but ur shit outta luck\".\n\nAITA for expecting him to do this for me"

            "text": "About four years ago I met a group of guys at a bar, and since then we have become pretty good friends, meeting once a week at said bar. We stopped meeting once the pandemic started so it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen some of them, but we still keep in contact through texting. I should also note that all of us use a beer social media app called Untappd. \n\nOne of the the guys, M, invited me to a party at his house about three years ago, and it was there I met his ex girlfriend, K. They were exes at the time so I assumed they had an amicable split and were still friends. I didn\u2019t talk to K much but since she was also into beer I added her on Untappd. \n\nI only met K once again and didn\u2019t see her around after that, but I didn\u2019t think much of it. We were never friends after all and I had barely known her. Occasionally I would get a Like from her on the app but it\u2019s not like we really talked. \n\nTwo years ago, M started dating another girl and they got married last year. They also moved a bit farther away last year so I haven\u2019t seen him since early 2020. \n\nA few weeks ago I tried to make plans to hangout with M. He told me he had no intention to hangout with me unless I deleted K from the beer app. I was taken aback at how aggressive he was being. I assumed either he was trolling me, or maybe that someone had taken his phone and was stirring up shit. But apparently he was dead serious and said it was inappropriate that I was \u201cstill\u201d following his ex on social media. \n\nM and I aren\u2019t super close friends, but he\u2019s generally a fun guy; meanwhile, I barely know K so I can\u2019t say she means much to me. But I didn\u2019t want to throw someone under the bus due to childish behavior, so I told M he needed to give me an actual reason why this suddenly mattered now. M said he shouldn\u2019t have to ask twice and then rebuffed my offer to hangout. Later he deleted me and several of the other guys from social media, so I guess I am officially unfriended. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I did the right thing here. I know M was being petty, immature and completely irrational. But he was my friend and K is not. So maybe it would have been better to just go along with it out of loyalty to my friend. \n\nAnd before you say anything, yes I am aware of the absurdity of a bunch of guys in their 30s getting into high school level drama over a beer app."

            "text": "*TW: miscarriage*\n\nEarlier this year, husband (DH) (31M) and I (26F) had a miscarriage. My doctor advised me to rest and not stressed, so we asked our families for privacy during this time. Two days later, I got a message from MIL saying she\u2019s been praying for my health and how I should see my loss as a \u201cblessing\u201d. She said that the baby didn\u2019t want to be born \u201cimperfect\u201d. Angry and sad can\u2019t begin to describe how I felt. I didn\u2019t tell my husband then, but I let him know she texted me. At that point I became numb to all my feelings and hid what happened. Over the next few months, I still felt really hurt by MIL\u2019s words. I kept my cool for DH\u2019s sake.\n\nIn June, I had several mental breakdowns due to stress, and I told DH what MIL texted me. He was upset and hurt. I said it was difficult for me to forgive her for saying that my miscarriage was a blessing. Apparently this BS was what she told DH, too. We debated whether or not to tell her. DH kept postponing it, and it started many arguments. He wants to do things subtly, but I\u2019m too upset to be civil. He told me that talking to her will do us no good, MIL always thinks she\u2019s right, and if we overstep, he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll lose his entire family (FIL and SIL will likely side with MIL).\n\nThis past weekend, DH got off a call with his parents and he was fuming.  He had to borrow some money from FIL to help pay medical bills. When ILs called him this past weekend, MIL was mad. She told him that many people go through pregnancy loss but people can\u2019t expect \u201chandouts\u201d. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s been months, you both should get over it by now and move on.\u201d DH explained how for the past few months, MIL said we should be grateful to have been pregnant, how our loss isn\u2019t unique, how we need to try have another legitimate child, and so much other BS.\n\nAfter this, I\u2019ve lost respect for MIL. Seeing DH this stressed has broken the last straw for me. I want her to know that her words have hurt us and has made us consider divorce to stop fighting. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be the asshole for confronting MIL, thus placing my husband at risk for getting cut off from his family."

            "text": "I wanted to get honest answers on this fight I had with my stepdad.\n\nI got married recently and I kept my last name. My husband ultimately decided to change his to mine so we could have the same last name and we could both share a name with future kids. When my stepdad realized I had kept my name he went through a bit of a weird phase where for a few days he was acting like I had done something to him. It was 11 days later he confronted me about why I didn't change my last name, why I had such a strong attachment to the name of a dead man, etc.\n\nSo the story is my dad died before I was born. He never got to meet me. But he did name me and I actually have his middle name (a gift from my mom as I like to think of it). My mom remarried when I was 9. My stepdad came into my life the same year they got married. I never felt like I was missing out on a dad. I heard so much about mine, had so many photos and videos of him, it felt like I knew him. And I've always loved him.\n\nMy stepdad asked to adopt me a few times. He also mentioned changing my name to his. My mom always respected my no. He was a little tougher to get to let go but eventually he had to.\n\nThe fact I am now a married woman and still have the last name I clung so hard to as a kid has deeply upset him. And he is taking it as me saying fuck you to him. I asked him why he was so upset by it and he told me it feels like I keep my name to spite him, to tell him I don't love him and he's not good enough.\n\nI told him it's not true. That keeping my name was never about him, it was about me and the connection I want to keep to my dad. I also told him my name was none of his business. He told me he was more my dad than my dad was and I said while others may see that as true, while he may want that to be true, for me that isn't true. That yes he was actually there for a part of my life while my dad was there for the pregnancy, his love for me still exists, and it doesn't not count just because he never got to meet me. I also told him my mom would say the same damn thing which he said he knows, and that he wishes she hadn't made him such a big part of my life. That she did me a disservice by giving me a dad who couldn't be there and making him impossible to live up to. I told him it was a horrible thing to stay and he married her knowing all this. He told me I was an asshole to him. That I don't care about the work he's put into raising me or the fact his feelings matter too. He told me to grow the fuck up and accept the fact he's my real dad, not my \"sperm donor\". I told him to get the fuck out of my house.\n\nMy mom is pissed with him. He told her exactly how he felt, not just about how I see him, but about it being her fault.\n\nHe's still pissed and I wonder if I went too far.\n\nAITA?"

So far, radio silent.\n\nWhen I first met her family, I thought of them as an extension of my friend. I knew my friend left them the bare minimum in her will so that they couldn't contest her will. No surprise\uff0cshe left most of her money to me. I told her sister that I would double her portion of her money as indicated in the will. At that time, she and her sister look alike and I couldn't help to feel close to her. But now, she doesn't seem interested to learn about her sister. The only time she reached out was about her sister's belongings and the money. I regretted my decision to double her money. Now I know my friend would never want her sister to get more money than what was indicated in the will.\n\n**Now is the part I may be the asshole.** I don't want to double the sister's money anymore.

We live nearly 2 hours away from her, so she said he can stay at her house the whole weekend and they can hang out while she's home. \n\nWell, last week, my boyfriend forgot about my birthday plans, and scheduled our cats vet appointment for the same day, so if he goes to her house, I have to take the cats, and my birthday plans will be completely canceled, and I'll be alone on my birthday.

I\u2019ve picked up a few words here and there, but it\u2019s a hard language to learn. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to her about this and she said she will try to speak English when I\u2019m around them. \n\nSure they\u2019ve got things they want to discuss they don\u2019t want me to understand, that\u2019s totally fine but when we\u2019re having dinner, or watching a movie at someone\u2019s house, going to the mall etc, they will stop speaking English. \n\nThe entire time we are together, I\u2019m excluded from the conversation. So instead I go on my phone, and then here she goes asking me to put it down and join in. WHAT?!!\n\nNow here\u2019s the horrible part I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve messaged her the next time we hang, I just want it to be the two of us. She was a bit offended that I didn\u2019t want her friends there, and she hasn\u2019t messaged me back in a day. \n\nI know I sound selfish and like an asshole."

When I came back, my dad not only had a new girlfriend that I didn't know about, but she was living in our house. I tried so hard to like her. My dad had recently gotten out of a relationship and the break up really took a toll on him, so when I realized that I didn't like the new girl, I kept my mouth shut because he was the happiest he'd been in almost a year.\n\nFor the past year and a half, I've been nice to her. I've engaged in conversation wholeheartedly, never letting on how I really felt about her.\n\nShe's not detrimental to him at all. In fact, she's helped him get his finances in order, helped him organize his business much much better, and been much more laid back than his previous girlfriends. I have my reasons for not liking her, but I do not think that she's bad for him. \n\nI never said anything because I figured it was none of my business. I'm a senior in college, and it's my dad's relationship, not mine. It's a healthy and functional relationship, and as long as he was happy, I figured I could just bite my tongue and be nice so that he could stay that way Because he deserves to be happy.\n\nANYWAYS. My Nana said something, and he ended up finding out how I feel about her. That I'm not exactly her biggest fan. He was so upset, accusing me of not wanting him to have anybody, essentially calling me selfish, saying that I'm a fake person...lots and lots of things....\n\nEven if I was trying to preserve his feelings, am I the asshole for not being honest with him?"

            "text": "I (14f) have a sister (20f) who has depression, anger issues and possibly bipolar disorder. She\u2019s entering her second year of college (she only does it online because she doesn\u2019t want to talk to people) and she\u2019s always unhappy. I understand that she is depressed but it\u2019s like she feels the need to bring everyone down as well. She\u2019s always upset that she has no friends but when people speak to her, she\u2019s rude and completely ignores them. Just saying good morning makes her upset. She sits around playing video games, reading books or watching an insane amount of politics (literally hours on end). In moderation it would be fine, but it\u2019s worrying that she does it almost religiously. She always agrees to go out with my mom and I shopping on the weekend only to spoil the day when she\u2019s angry that there are \u201ctoo many people in a shop\u201d. This leads to my mom getting angry and cancelling our plans early Every.Single.Time. On top of that I am in sports and that means we have practices and other activities outside of school. My sister drives me while my mom works and while I am very grateful and always make sure to say thank you, my sister never fails to mention that I should not go out even though I always wear my mask and social distance as much as possible. She made it very clear that I should discontinue my sport entirely. I truly try my best to understand her but I\u2019m at my limit. She constantly disrespects me and my religion (I\u2019m no longer Christian and she always calls me a satanist or atheist), she gets upset when I go spend time with my friends and constantly gives up on school and doesn\u2019t study but complains how the world is already against her since she\u2019s black so she has no reason to try. She\u2019s never had a job, has no friends and is completely isolated besides my mom and I. I\u2019m sick of it because I feel as though I can\u2019t enjoy high school if she\u2019s constantly bringing the mood of our family down to the point where I won\u2019t have fun in anything I do. My mom has offered therapy, a psychiatrist, and we try our best to support her but I can\u2019t take it anymore. Yesterday we got into an argument when she agreed to come out to the store with my mom and I. She was rude to us as usual and I just snapped at her since my summer is almost over and she ruined yet another weekend outing. I screamed at her and told her that everyone shouldn\u2019t have to be sad and depressed every time she\u2019s around just because she is. I feel like I might have been insensitive because I have an eating disorder but hide it very well whereas her depression is known to everyone so it might be stressful for her and idk if I can fully comprehend that. I\u2019m not going to act like I\u2019m perfect because I can be just as annoying as any other younger sibling, but for the most part I try to stay in my room to give her space. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: My depressed sister is always bringing the entire family down with her sour mood and I can\u2019t even enjoy anything anymore."

This led to him telling me that he sometimes says it as a \"joke\", which of course led to me saying he himself is racist. He then became very offended that I would ever call him racist since I knew him for so long, and that it's just jokes and dark humor. I told him I would no longer think he is racist if he would remove it from his vocabulary and stop using it completely, as I am a POC and have been on the receiving end of the word, it hurts me to see a friend using it nonchalantly and told him I don't feel comfortable with him thinking a word like that can be used as a joke. But he kept insisting I was the wrong one for ever saying a friend like him is racist, and went as far as saying he does not want to be friends with me as long as I think he is racist. AITA?"

He continues to speak in almost a whisper or at normal volume when there are other noises and I can tell he's speaking but can't make it out. If I ask him to repeat, he repeats at the same volume and eventually gets annoyed with me and tells me to drop it if I ask him to repeat too much. \n\nWe've had so many arguments about how he needs to speak more loudly if he wants me to hear him but he never does. It also feels like he makes a point to talk to me when I'm in the shower/washing my hands/doing dishes/vacuuming, basically anytime I'm doing something that makes a sound, he'll think it's the best time to talk to me and I have to stop what I'm doing because he refuses to speak up.\n\nI'm honestly pretty tired of it and have decided that from now on if he speaks too quietly for me to hear what he's saying, I'm just going to pretend I didn't hear him at all. I'm tired of having to fight to understand him while he continues to make 0 effort.

Friday night he tells me he knows a chicken place that makes the best chicken ever so last night I offer to order it. He doesn't want the chicken because he's been vegetarian for a couple of months and just take a wrap and fries. I pay for his order too as thanks for letting me stay.\n\nWhen the order is here, he eats is wrap and I eat my chicken and indeed that was the best chicken of my life but it's a whole chicken and with the fries at some point I just stop eating especially since a friend of him showed up and I didn't want my fingers to be oily any longer. I think it's ok since I'm probably going to be hungry at some point or I can still eat it tomorrow so I \"hide it\" in the kitchen even though I'm not expecting anyone to steal the chicken.\n\nI take a shower before we start drinking and the chicken is gone. But thank God it was just in the fridge. It's true that it was stupid to just put it under the counter. So we start drinking, fun evening and then he says he's going to make another drink in the kitchen. I hear the microwave and think nothing of it but then come back with a plate with half my chicken on it and a lot of sauce I don't even know what that is. I ask ''is it the chicken that was in the box ?'' obviously he says yes and offer me some. I say no and that I was eating with my finger and the box must have looked like a mess even though I didn't put bones back in. He says he doesn't care and his friend and him started eating the chicken. He didn't eat it off the box, he took the chicken out of the box and made a whole meal out of it.\n\nNow if he asked I wouldn't mind (that much) sharing my chicken even though I hid it it wasn't obvious that I was hiding it. I paid for it but I just have to buy the chicken again tomorrow it's 20 bucks but I'm having a weekend-long party so I'm spending my entire salary anyway. However I really think this is a douche move to not even ask, it was very obviously my food, if his wrap was on the counter i would never touch it and I don't eat anything in the fridge without authorization. It's his place but if I'm paying for my order I honestly expect that nobody touches it. However it's just a chicken and maybe it wasn't clear enough that this was for me."

More like a sister.\n\nShe has a friend, Mike (m early 30s) who she's known since he was a teen, through online gaming. Mike has been dealing with some things, and Vicky said he's been different recently, more suspicious, more cagey. I knew he accused some of our other friends of hating him, but I wasn\u2019t involved.\n\nFor a year I thought Mike was one of my friends. I really liked him, hell, I surprised him one night with a copy of his favorite photo he'd taken, with a detail that he hated edited out.\n\nThen he brought in Adam (m20s), who came in with history. Up until the day I met him, all I knew about Adam was that he was kind of a troll. Vicky asked me if I was cool with him hanging around and I said yes, as long as he didn\u2019t pull anything like they told me about. That was it, that was my only opinion on the matter.\n\nAt some point, things started getting fucky whenever Adam was around, like stuff getting destroyed. But I did my best to give Adam the benefit of the doubt. I looked for every possible explanation, because I knew he was important to Mike.\n\nThen it all blew up. Vicky was very high one night and went off on me over a misunderstanding. Mike came to me later with an ultimatum - that I had wronged his two closest friends, and I had to make it up to them if I wanted to be his friend. I told him that Vicky had already apologized because she was the one who came after me, and I hadn't done any of the shit he accused me of with Adam, saying I secretly hated him and so on.\n\nMike also accused me of hating him from the start, and he knew I resented that he had been \"forced\" into my life. Which was so untrue I didn't even really know what to say except how wrong it was. Finding out that all this time my \u201cfriend\u201d was building some case against me hurt a lot.\n\nVicky basically stopped communicating with me. I asked her if everything was okay and she said yes, we were fine. But when it became clear that things weren't going to work out with me &amp; Mike, she came to me and said that she knew him 15 years and so she was taking his side. Over something that never happened.\n\nThat was when I realized that all of our friends Mike had claimed hated him were no longer in Vicky's life. She\u2019d been cutting off people he said had a problem. I felt that was a bigger issue than how mad she might be with me, and I went to her with it. I even made it clear that I wasn't just worried for her, but also for Mike. By that point, I was the last of her regular friends left. When I pointed out that she was becoming more isolated, she said it was for her mental health. That sounds backwards to me, especially as someone who also suffers from serious depression.\n\nNow Vicky won't talk to me, after saying she actually had been avoiding me. Part of me wonders if I should have just kept my mouth shut."

            "text": "It's often hard for me (30f) when it comes to feelings (autistic) and I often overreact (on the inside, I'm make sure it dose not show), I often get disapointed in friends when others wouldn't. This make me feel like AH often but I really can't stop the feelings and they are overwhelming. But this time i don't think my feelings are wrong but would apriciate help to be sure.\n\nAlmost 1,5 y ago we had baby number two at the same time as you know what happend. Well, my husbandet lost his jobb and I went on parental leave. He started studying and I stayed home with the kids. Between the two of us we have a lower income than I do on my own when I work and so it has been for 1,5 years now (couldn't go back to work beacuse of you know what) it's been hard. So i started work again one month ago and got my first paycheck (yey) but we have used up all our savings so I put away half my salary for emergansys (like car repare and things like that). Note that my friend know all of this. \n\nMy friend of 10 years and her family live down the road from us. My husband was friends with her bf for almost 15 years so we know them well. He got a great jobb, pays almost dubble what i make when I work and she make minimum because she is a student. They got two kids (4f and 8f). She is really good at a lot of things but not sewing so I help her out when she need to sew curtains and things lite that. They were going camping in their caravan and needed new curtains because it get to bright to early so the kids could't sleep. So i stayed upp 2 hours after bedtime to fix it for her (she asked the day before they went).\n\nTwo weeks later they come back home and me and the kids go over to hangout. The 8yo was away with her grandma to sell some old toys at a flea market to make som extra cash. My friend show me some item that the 8yo are going to sell the next day. One thing (there were like 15 items) was an unopend pack of dipers in my youngest size that she had marked with 1/3 of the original cost (dipers are extremly exspencive were we live). So I asked if I could by them for that price. She got all weird and said something like \"my kid think it's so much fun to sell... something somthing mumbeling... well mabey you could, I guess...give her money... mumbeling...\" so I stopped her suffering by shrugging and changeing the subject and we just talk for an other hour having a good time while the kids played and then went home.\n\nIt really make me sad that she so clearly did not want to sell them to me when she knows how we have had it over the past year after I just two weeks prior sew two pars of curtains for her for free (only the work, she bought the fabric). On the other hand now I'm making money again... \n\nIATA for beeing hurt thinking that she could have sold them to me so that we could save more money even if it is just a little and just a pack of dipers?"

I used to admire her and care alot for her.\n\nEver since she was small, she would travel yearly to Disney. She would bring sourverniers every time to my dad but would turn around and tell me that she didn't have enough money for my gift. I didn't mind that she didn't bring me sourverniers, what i did mind was that the only gift i ever got from her was a star wars pin she got participating in a ride. \n\nWhen she was studying in university, she rarely came to visit when our weekends to visit dad overlapped. I told myself then that \"She must be busy\" or \"University is hard\" (which it is, but she still had time to party with friends in those weekends)\n\nBack in 2016, we moved very far away and she'd post on Facebook and message me and my younger brother how much she missed us. \n\nIn 2018 we had earned enough to visit home for three full months but out of those 90 days in the same city, we saw eachother three times. (Two of them were in family gatherings) then when we left, it was the same song and dance as when we left in 2016: she'd post and message us on how she missed us.\n\nThen comes 2021, my dad's been alone in a new state and we had just saved enough and gotten all the vaccine details to visit him. We brought him sourverniers and we participated in everything he wanted to do together as a family since he was feeling lonely after 3 years apart.\n\nMy sister, (who has three trips to disney planned this year) visits for two days and spends all of it on her phone or watching tv. She interacted with my brother but interacted a small ammount with my dad and mostly ignored me. Then a couple weeks later, she tells me and my brother that she'd love matching sibling tattoos since she misses us (a third time she says she misses us but barely recognizes we exist when we see her) even though she knows how much I dislike the idea of tattoos for myself.\n\nAt this point I believe she's just looking for attention with her 'woe is me, my brothers and father are far away'.\n\nI've gotten tired at this point and want to just block further conversations and posts with her, as I feel like i'm getting exhausted with her in general after 15 years of trying to care for my sister because she's family.\n\nMy brother and mother think I shouldn't block her as she's family and it might seem rude to her but I'm nlt sure anymore."

She's been calling people.\n\nThis morning, I was feeling worse, I ask if she can make some tea for me. She did, and asked if I want some toast for food. That sounded terrible so I said no, then she came back with tea and said she needed a nap and didn't wake up until noon. \n\nSo I had no one to take care of me, and had to find breakfast for myself even though I was seriously feeling like shit. I feel very much deserted. When she finally woke up, she came to feel my forehead and said, let's find you a doctor. Then again, she went into her room and didn't come out until almost an hour later, and said I now have an appointment. I was still feeling like shit and ask her to take care of me. She didn't seem to genuinely care, in fact, I feel like she resent me for being sick.\n\nThen she said, look, I intend to take care of you, but you need to be a little nicer to me.\n\nI got very pissed, because she made taking care of me sound very conditional. She is my wife, if she is sick I 'd take care of her no matter what, no matter if she's nice to me or mean to me. I really hate when she make this basic thing spouses should do for each other conditional. That was also very condescending--only if I behave will I get some care, like I am a kid asking for candy. I already feel very bad, and she is still demanding things from me. So I said, you don't take care of me at all. I complained a couple of times, and she got very upset and said, \"I can't be your full time nanny, but I will try my best to take care of you, but I need you to reflect on your manners and be a little nicer\". This came off as extremely condescending as she used the word \"nanny\" as suggesting I am some sort of a kid. So I got even more angry, I was already under a lot of stress as I have a big deadline coming up this Friday and I had to work even though I am sick. We ended up having a huge fight. AITA for asking for a little care when I am so stressed and feeling like shit? \n\nI guess one can say I am the asshole for accusing her of not taking care of me repeatedly, when she did make me tea? But I really feel very much neglected, and deserved a little more...\n\nPS. She did tell me she needed the long nap in the morning because she had been up very early making calls to the east coast.\n\nPS. I am fine now."

I've been meaning to buy more for awhile but never actively mentioned it to her, it was just something she noticed I needed. Two pairs were active wear, the other two for everyday.

I was so blown away that I gave an everyday pair to my brother to try out the next day and I let him keep it. \n\nMy girlfriend was helping me with my laundry yesterday and said she couldn't find the fourth pair, so I was honest and told her I gave it to my brother. She was disappointed and got upset. I told her that it was a gift so I could do what I wanted with it, even if it meant giving it to someone else. She said she understood that, but she never expected that kind of gift to be something I give away.  She said she knew that it would be something I could get a lot of use out of so she wanted to get me some really nice pairs, and she was disappointed in me giving it to him when I could've let him try them on/recommended them to him and still gotten use out of them. \n\nShe puts a lot more personal value on gift giving than I do and puts a lot of effort into finding/making thoughtful gifts. She also tries to keep gifts budget friendly, so I could see the amount she spent being a factor in her reaction even though she didn't mention cost at any point(I was curious so looked it up, $90ish). I mostly just see gifts as items and I'm not super sentimental. Since the underwear was a gift, I can do with it as I please once it is given to me.

Never had a party, hardly have had friends over (mostly due to covid restrictions). \n\nLast night (a SATURDAY night) I had two mil spouse friends over for a sleepover. (We\u2019re all females. Idk if that\u2019s a significant detail or not). They are both moms and I am not so they came to my home for a night away from the kids. We were chit chatting on my balcony (approx. 11pm) while one friend had a smoke and my German neighbor leaned out his window and started yelling at us in German. None of us speak the language unfortunately so we couldn\u2019t converse with him or even understand what he was saying. One friend picked out the words \u201cAmericans\u201d and \u201cpolice\u201d. We used a translator to try to explain we were trying not to be loud but he continued yelling for a bit, then went back inside. We just continued chatting trying to be a little more quiet when he came out again not 10 minutes later yelling the same thing.

We went back inside to talk and be considerate but the longer the night went on the more angry and upset I got.

I really wanted a fairy tale  wedding but we didn\u2019t have much money so I really made an effort and started to  save  practically all of my money.

The contract  clearly stated that the cost should be completely payed  15 days before the wedding and that any unexpected date changes or cancellations would cost extra money. I though to myself: \u201cthis will never happen\u201d and signed the contract. \n\nBut surprise surprise the pandemic happened. I was very worried about this so I called this woman, apologized and asked to change the date and push my wedding back. I also said that I totally understood if this meant we had to pay extra money. This upset her a lot. She tried to convince me not to change my wedding. She told me I was over reacting and that changing the date represented a huge loss of money for her and that if I wanted to change the date I would have to pay 200 dollars more. I apologized, agreed, and payed her the money. She made it very clear that \u201cshe was making this effort for me and that I should be grateful because I was making her lose money\u201d. \nBy now we had already payed the original 2500 dollars. \n\nI had to change the date for a second and then a third time. At this point I was mentally exhausted and I didn\u2019t want to make the call so I asked my boyfriend if he could talk to this lady. \n\nHe called and told her that we couldn\u2019t know the exact date we wanted to celebrate the wedding on because nobody knew when the pandemic was going to end. He asked her for an open date: Once we felt safe we would call her and ask for any available dates she had and choose, but since we had already payed the original cost he asked her if she could  take that money into account and only charge us a difference. \n\nShe said no. \n\nShe said this deal didn\u2019t make her feel safe and that holding an open date for us was not an option. I was so sick of the whole situation I told her just to cancel the wedding and that was the end of that. \n\nIt\u2019s been 6 months I got  married in my back yard and I feel better now but can\u2019t shake away the feeling that this whole situation was  unfair.

His parents drove all of us down to florida (20 hours drive) and we had never been closer.

Once the trip was over Matt and his parents drove straight to colorado so he could do a theatre camp for 2 weeks. I figured that things would go back to normal and we would facetime everyday after camp and our routine would continue, this however turned out to be false. He facetimed me 3 times during that two week trip, but that\u2019s not the part I am mad about. He met a girl at theater camp and posted about her on every single platform imaginable. Keep in mind I still haven\u2019t told him about my crush, but by then it had died down so I figured I would get it off my chest to him and tell him I was over it and make a joke of it.

            "text": "So some backstory, due to the rental situation where we live, rental houses are really hard to come by. Due to this we had to move about a 30 minute drive out of town. Not long after we moved, I (23yrs old) chose to move about 8 hours away from my family for university, after 3 months, I made the choice to move back home because my mother was struggling with bills and looking after my grandfather. When I got home about 3 weeks ago, I discovered that my sister (18yrs old) was leeching off my mother. She would leave her dog at home for mum to look after while she went and stayed at her boyfriends for days at a time, while at her boyfriends she would only ever call mum to ask for money or to pick her up from her boyfriends. While she was at her boyfriends, she would never answer her phone. When she is home, instead of looking for a job, she sleeps until 2 in the afternoon and when she is awake, she lays on the lounge watching netflix. When I moved back, I gave her no slack, we have had nothing but arguments about how she lives, her only coping mechanism is to go into her room and cry. When I've suggested a viable job for her, she \"doesn't want to work there\" for no reason, whatever money she does get she blows instantly on stuff she doesn't need (for example, this week she spent $100 on a fishtank for her 1 fish that already had a perfectly fine tank), she leaves it up to me and my mum to buy her dogs food, toys, and when she had to go to the vet last week, I'm the one that forked out $400 for a vet bill. So today, when I left the house before work, I gave her a list of things to do, like wash the dishes, throw the load of laundry in the dryer, feed the dogs and maybe take them for a walk to get out of the house, she said she would do it all. I got home from work 4 hours later and nothing had been done, the dogs were unfed and the kitchen was still filthy, plus I had to rewash the clothes in the washing machine because they were starting to smell. So I drilled her about it, and after a heated argument I ended up telling her ring her boyfriend and tell him to pick her up. When he got here I made sure all her shit was packed and out the front ready to go and told her not to come back until she had gotten her shit together and was willing to pay her way, when she went to take her dog I told her that she wasn't taking her. In the 10 minutes that her boyfriend was here I had him threaten to \"cave my head in\" if I didn't hand over the dog, but after witnessing my sister not feeding them when I asked I wasn't going to letnher dog go to a place where she would get neglected. I walked inside and locked the door, since that happened 2 hours ago I have gotten messages from her friends and even one of my friends telling me Im way out of line and that it wasn't my place to kick her out, I haven't spoken to my mother about it because she is still working and can't answer the phone while she's at work.

They cut off all financial support because we need to be independent now (except for the house that they alr paid for years ago so no rent), except if we rlly need some but only for the baby bcs they didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nBoth i and my now girlfriend go to university, her online and me offline to be closer to the factory i now work part time in.\nWhile my girlfriend started a catering business so she can work from home.\n\nTo save money to buy lunch, usually she delivers the leftovers from that day over to me by a courier service.\n\nSometimes she forgets but one my colleague\u2019s mom often packs him extra food which he offers to me so i just remind her and problem over.\n\nThis one time my colleague called in sick when she forgot so i ended up doing labor with no lunch. \n\nWhen i got home i saw my lunch sitting on the kitchen counter which she forgot to courier, i told her off kind of grumpily bcs i was starving. Turns out it slipped her mind bcs her friend came over.\n\nClarification: i didn\u2019t yell at her or anything, i just went \u201cwill you please set a reminder or something? Bcs this can\u2019t keep going on\u201d in a rather exasperated tone which i apologized for after i cooled down.\n\nMe and my girlfriend talked abt it and we\u2019re okay now, but her friend wasn\u2019t happy. She told me that i can\u2019t be expecting my 5 month pregnant girlfriend to feed me and clean the house.\n\nClarification: the house my parents\u2019 gave us was an old house which alr had a roomba so there\u2019s no need for her to do any work thats too tiring, but there is some laundry and dishes. Also we split the chores on weekends since i have some free time.\n\nAm i toxic? Am i the a-hole? And if i am, any advice on how to fix it is very much appreciated."

            "text": "Okay so background my brand new car had been in the shop after someone had hit me while it was parked, thankfully the police got their info and everything was sorted out with my insurance, but I had been without a car for 4 months. My gf would pick me up and drop me off at home since we both worked at the same place , and she\u2019d also pick me up and drop me off for all our dates and frankly while I really appreciated it, it made me a little depressed. I felt like a burden, less of a man almost. Which is silly I know but it just felt kind if emasculating. So when my gf brought up how she was craving a dessert from a really far bakery but was too far to drive, I decided I\u2019d get it for her. I felt like she deserved it and I would finally be able to do something for her after feeling like she was doing so much for me. So I told her I\u2019d get it for her and she asked how and I said I\u2019d figure it out and she said she didn\u2019t want me to take the train or bus because she worry\u2019s it isn\u2019t safe and I\u2019d take too long. At that time I said okay because I thought after 3 months in the shop my car would be done by then but it wasn\u2019t . So I look up bus routes and find one, it\u2019s 2 hours, fuck it I\u2019m game. So I go get her the dessert and tell her to stop by my house before her shift, And she asks how I got it, and I lied and told her I roped one of my friends to take me and she believed me. I told her recently that I lied and I had been feeling depressed and wanted to do something for her. And she got pissed. I\u2019ve apologized for lying but she\u2019s still been giving me the cold shoulder for a couple days and I understand lying wasn\u2019t the best option to go with when I got her the dessert but I didnt want her to worry about me. And I understand she\u2019s mad because I lied but I feel Like in the end it wasnt really a big deal. So I ask the wise ones on Reddit AITAH?"

            "text": "My brother and I was supposed to meet my cousin's in-laws and her family told us that only one of us could go. Since my brother saw the gifts they made for the in-laws, they wanted him to go. But because I had already had a bath and sorted out my outfit for the day. My mum told the bride's family that I was gonna go but they were disappointed because they really wanted my brother to go. I felt a bit taken aback by this. I still powered through because I needed to have that stiff upper lip as I was gonna go to the bride's house to collect gifts to go to the in-laws house. My sister saw my t-shirt and it was a WWE t-shirt and I told her that I was going to be wearing a jacket over it anyway. She gave me a disgusted look as I wore it even though there was nothing bad on the t-shirt. She told me to get changed which as you can probably guess p***ed me off.\n\nI told my brother how much it reminded me of that awful time when my sister said that I couldn't wear my suit to her graduation and I had to wear my brother's suit instead. I refused because I like to wear my own clothes and not someone else's. Specifically, something that I bought with my own money. During this, my sister (who hadn't heard my conversation with my brother) is whispering to my brother to give me some of his clothes which literally gave me flashbacks to my sister's graduation. I know neither day was about me but I still have the right to feel comfortable in what I wear, right?\n\nMy brother gave me a lecture about how I'm representing the family but I just play it off in a kind of annoyed manner because I was fuming up until that point. They thought that I didn't care about impressing the in-laws so when we got to my sister's car, I just burst into tears. I knew I couldn't hold back anymore but the fact that it was an important day but not for me so I couldn't complain just completely broke me. \n\nMy sister told me that I can control the aux for the car ride and as I played music that I like which is different to the type of music that they all like. One sister said \"Ngl this is actually a bop\" and they both seemed to enjoy it which was weird because they normally hate the music that I like. However recently, I talked to my sister about the song and she didn't remember it. She only pretended to like it to make me feel better. I came to the realisation that the whole reason for trying to make me feel better wasn't so I would be happy and less depressed going forward but so that I wouldn't be upset when going to the houses that we were visiting. \n\nI was at my cousin's house ready to pick up the gift baskets to give to the in-laws until one of my sisters says for me to pull my pants up. I glared at them for a bit before pulling my pants up. They walked laughing saying \"He hates us haha\". You're probably wondering why I got annoyed at them then, but basically imagine if someone made fun of your face and then told you that you had spinach in your teeth."

            "text": " Today was a long day and the culmination of a long week. I work in special ed, first week back for students. I'm mentally and physically exhausted. After I get home, I learn my brother-in-law has suggested going out to dinner to my husband. I'm not really interested in being out around other people, but not having to cook sounds nice.\n\nCue shenanigans with asking my parents to babysit, some minor fighting with my mom over our younger child getting hurt. My mood is now way worse, but at this point, backing out of dinner would disappoint everyone. We head to the restaurant.\n\nMy BIL gets to the restaurant first and puts us on the waitlist. We meet him, his wife and a mutual friend outside a bakery near the restaurant. The bakery has two metal tables on either side of the door. Brother-in-law, wife and friend are sitting in three metal chairs around one table. Presumably one was dragged over from the other table, which has one empty metal chair. It also has a box of cookies and a vase of flowers on it. I'm barely looking at those, I'm looking at that chair. Because I'm tired.\n\nI'm barely following the conversation the others are having. This is not unusual for me, and they know this. I have Asperger's and ADHD, and they know I had a long week. I hear my brother-in-law say something about what I assumed was the cookies and flowers. That some guy asked them to watch his stuff while he went into the bakery.\n\nWell, I don't want cookies or flowers, I just want to sit. I assume my husband is not taking the chair because he wants to chat with his brother. I go sit down. They all give me weird looks, but they don't say anything. I assume they're reacting to me being my usual, anti-social self. Well, they know me, and if they want me to rejoin them, they can say so. I get on my phone.\n\nSeveral minutes pass, and suddenly I take note of man coming out the bakery, glaring daggers at me. Eye contact unsettles me at the best of times. I shrink into my chair and reabsorb into my phone. I'm thinking I'll just keep my distance from his stuff, so he won't think I'm messing with it. He can take it and go.\n\nWhich he does, actively catching my eye again to give me a disapproving look. Cue BIL and husband half-heartedly offering the guy a chair at the other table, as the guy storms off. Then my husband looks at me and says \"the polite thing would have been to give him back his chair.\"\n\nIt clicks, they weren\u2019t watching the box of cookies and flowers for the guy, they were saving his chair. Would have been great if that had been clarified. I feel awful, but also angry at my husband and friends not saying anything They know me. They know I mishear things and miss social cues, but that I would never just take someone's chair.\n\nAm I the asshole?"

            "text": "Tl;Dr - I got sick of watching my friend make bad decision after bad decision and lashed out. I'm aware I was harsh but I'm not convinced I was wrong to do it.\n\nI have been friends with R for close to 10 years, we're both in our 30s. He is an absolute sweetheart but struggles with general life skills and doesn't have much common sense. He has a lot of childhood trauma and severe ADHD which may explain this. He's only a couple of years younger than me but he often seems like a little kid.\n\nDuring the time I've known him, I have watched him make bad decision after bad decision and apparently never learn from his mistakes. Most of his worst decisions are about relationships. He has been mistreated by every partner he's ever had and I probably don't even know half of it since he always tries to act like it isn't happening. He lets people treat him like crap then he gets confused because it keeps happening. He's said he doesn't understand what's wrong with him, in my opinion it's incredibly obvious how vulnerable and defenceless he is so of course he's going to attract that type of person. I imagine most decent people wouldn't feel comfortable starting a relationship with him because they would be concerned about taking advantage. He's said before that he doesn't feel like he deserves to be treated well which honestly just seems like self pity and an excuse to avoid changing. Of course I sympathise and do my best to support him but it becomes infuriating after a while and I admit I have lost my temper with him.\n\nThe current argument happened a few days back when R was buzzing about a new man he's seeing despite still being traumatised by the last one. I suggested it might be a good idea to take a break from dating, he said he had planned to but this man felt really \"right\". I said something along the lines of \"Well you haven't made a smart decision the entire time I've known you, so why start now?\" I do get that this was harsh, but to put it in context - the last time R had a bad break up, he ended up sleeping with his 60-something year old therapist less than a week later and completely spiralled . He does not do the standard silly rebound stuff and I'm sick of our friends acting like his behaviour is totally normal and I'm \"judging\" him for expressing concern.\n\nI have apologised for my tone but not for what I said, because honestly I don't think I'm wrong. Our mutual friends are all giving me the cold shoulder and R is upset but I'm sick of everyone acting like his behaviour is fine when it clearly isn't. AITA?"

            "text": "New account to protect my kid's privacy. \n\nMy kid is dyslexic and gets 504 accommodations at school here in Tx. He started 7th grade after one year of homeschooling (due to the pandemic). Last week I checked his grades and saw he got 50% on a science quiz. I asked him to review material before he retakes it. He said his teacher makes them leave notebooks in class. (There are no text books, everything is done on chromebook or worksheets.) I was a bit annoyed that they are being tested on stuff they only see for an hour at a time and can't review, so I email teacher a firm note saying kid is dyslexic and entitled to bring notes home. I bcc the VP. The VP replies that yes, kid is allowed to bring home notes, and gets extra time AND that she will review 504 policy with all teachers again. Teacher replies that Kids are always welcome to take home notes (basically calling my kid a liar). I am annoyed but life goes on. \n\nThe next week kid had an excuse absence. He went up to a different teacher to ask what he had missed in class. Mr. Jerkface said to \"go ask a classmate.\" My kid is shy and didn't have friends in the class to ask so came home not knowing what he missed. A video? A lecture? An activity? No idea. I was upset so I emailed the teacher and dryly asked for missing assignments. I then emailed VP and let her know exactly what the teacher had said and that it was a violation of 504 accommodations and that he was extremely unprofessional as it is not the responsibility of another 12 year old to supply my kid with missing info.\n\nI got no replies at all from anyone. The next time my kid has this teacher, Mr. Jerkface hands him a packet and says \"all you had to do was ask your group, all right?\" My kid says he used a disappointed tone. (The packet was 6 pages, front and back, small type, and a worksheet to fill out with info from pages. Also kid says that with activities like this in the past the teacher would hand out papers then play an accompanying video and even pause when class should take notes. I am guessing video was a link he could easily email but didn't. So my kid probably didn't get all the teaching materials he missed). \n\nSo we find ourselves in a situation where we get this packet on Thursday and might have a quiz on it the next day, we don't know. We want to drop the matter to avoid any retaliation from Mr. Jerkface. But I am also tempted to email the VP again just to document his behaviour. \n\nI want to know if I'm the asshole for possibly overreacting to this horrible teacher. He could have just given my kid the papers when first asked. Or he could have said he would get the work the next day, or that it was a group project he could maker up later, literally anything other than what he said would have probably been fine. Did I overreact? Did I earn a Karen reputation?"

We've also been struggling to relearn what it's like to live with family and it has kind of put restrictions on what we can do with each other in each other's house (if you know what I mean...). I really don't want to live with my family anymore and I asked if he would be interested in moving in together once he finds a job, but he said unless we move back to the city  we used to live together (which I rather not do since I already converted my work to be 100% remote) he rather stay living at home. \n\nI am lucky enough to have a good remote job that provides me enough income to possibly get a small studio on my own so I started to look for a place. I showed him a potential studio 20 min from his house and he mentioned how he liked that it was close so he can visit every weekend. I then asked him how often he plans on staying over at my new place and he said he was thinking every weekend (Friday night - Sunday night) and probably sometimes during the week if we do anything together. He also mentioned how it just makes sense to go to my studio every weekend since we would be able to be alone together. \n\nI obviously love my boyfriend and would want to see him as much as I can but part of me was a little put off that he was fine with sleeping over most of the week but didn't want to just find a place together. He is still very firm about only moving in together if we move back (with or without a job I might add) so part of me wants to ask if he can contribute to the rent or utilities of my new place if he is going to come over as often. I don't want to come off as if I'm making him pay to spend the night with me, but three nights EVERY week is a kinda a lot if he isn't going to just move in. I also know that he is pretty secure with his finances as he has a substantial amount of money saved from when he worked as a student, and his parents are planning on continuing to giving him a decent amount of money every month. I'll also probably only ask for $150 at the absolute most (rent for the studios I'm looking at is around $1,300).\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend who I used to live with doesn't want to move in together unless we move back to another city, but wants to spend 3 nights every week at my new studio and I want to ask him to help pay rent/utilities."

I have been helping T and generally has been a pleasant experience for all of us my uncle included. My other aunt B who lives 2 hours away asked me if I would be interested in coming to stay with her. For the past month I have been spending a week at T\u2019s and then a week at B\u2019s, alternating every week. All was well until I arrived at B\u2019s this past Sunday. \n\nUpon arriving at B\u2019s, she was very micro managey and inconsistent with her rules. We had a small argument on Monday night about it and I thought things had been resolved regarding each other\u2019s boundaries until tonight (Friday). \n\nWe were eating dinner and in the middle of my meal she asked if I would put my dog in her crate so that B could try and get her cat in for the night. I respectfully asked B if I could wait until I was finished eating because I was going to share a small piece of unseasoned chicken with my dog ( I will occasionally do this with my dog and she knows that she must wait calmly until I finish eating for her treat). \n\nLess than five minutes after my aunt made her request of me she got up and called my dog over to her. I did not notice because I was on my phone browsing Reddit. When I looked up my aunt was closing the door of the crate. \n\nI calmly asked of her that I would have preferred that she had reiterated her request and I would have done it immediately. She rudely insinuated that I would not have listened. I then was able to get out the words. \u201cBut B I just feel as if you crossed a boundary by not-\u201c her snappily shouted interruption went something like \u201cand I just feel like your crossing my boundaries right now, so put a button in it!\u201d \n\nI let her know that I thought that was extremely rude and that I was hurt. She told me again to put a button in it. So I calmly got up, collected my dog and went downstairs to pack my stuff. \n\nWhen I came back upstairs to grab the last of my stuff she pretended like nothing happened. As I was leaving she asked me to let her know when I got back to aunt T\u2019s house. I let her know that \u201c no thanks I think I\u2019ll keep a button in it.\u201d  \n\nSo, AITA here? I would like some perspective on this matter."

My mother eventually found all the boxes and was furious at first, but then thought it was adorable. I didn\u2019t get punished, but she had no issues continuing to smoke all the new packs. That beyond angered me.\n\nFrom that age to up about now, I was decently respectable. \u201cMom, you gotta lose some weight, Ill go on walks with you\u201d \u201cYou gotta quick smoking those things, Dad.\u201d They always responded with im trying\u2026 without making any actual effort. Even if I try to help them along.\n\nBut as of recently ive been really stern. Ive noticed my mothers been gaining more and more weight and finds it more difficult to move around. My dad now exceeds smoking 2 packs a day. You can hear him breathing on the otherside of the room. They\u2019re both in their 50s and age is hitting them hard.\n\nThings ive told my mother recently has been along the lines of. \u201cYou will never see my kids graduate, just like your mother never saw me graduate\u2026 if you keep smoking those things.\u201d \u201cOne day your back will give out. You\u2019re 50, its make it or break it time now.\u201d \u201cGrandma died at 53, you are 50 right now\u2026 start doing something even if its small.\u201d Shed start crying, and yell at me to stop. I took her to Walgreens and bought them nicotine patches.\n\nThings ive told my father. \u201cEvery male in out family since the year 1919 has died of cancer. What makes you any different?\u201d \u201cGrandpa died at 52 of cancer. You\u2019re currently 50. You need to fucking quit right now.\u201d \u201cTwo fucking packs a day? Cut it down to one.\u201d \u201cDamnit Dad, I can hear you breathing across the room. Wake up already. Do something about it already.\u201d Hed just stay silent. I also got him nicotine patches.\n\nThose comments overall would just anger them like no other, my dad didn\u2019t outright show it but he felt it.\n\nThey tried for two days and quit, no matter how much encouragement I gave. Help around the house to ease their stress. But nothing. My older sister told me im acting likr an asshole. That I should just quit trying and let them die at 55. I think shes right because all im doing is pissing them off.\n\nTl;dr: Parents in poor health, wouldnt change habits. So I started hitting deep to wake them up to change, still didn\u2019t. AITA?"

            "text": "AITA for telling my friends that they need to do better being there. Some context here: my friend group consists of 4 people including myself. We all live 30-65 minutes away from each other. We all work and study full-time. 2/3 of us are married (including me). We mostly communicate via group chat. We are all impacted by the 7 week lockdown in NSW. I see them as my brothers as we have been friends for 4-7 years.\n\nSince the beginning of our friendship, I have always been the one to reach out, call, organise outings ect. Whenever I have done this its been hell organising as none of them can get their schedules straight. I almost always get met with \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d, \u201cSorry gonna cancel\u201d, \u201cnot bothered\u201d. I feel like no matter how hard I try to reach out (especially during the lockdown) I get shut down. This kinda feels unfair cause I\u2019m just as busy as the both of them but I still find time to reach out. I know that they don\u2019t prioritise me, however, when I mentioned this, they both got very defensive. \u201cYou could do better fitting your schedule to us!\u201d (I already have, as I am the one with the most flexible schedule) Or \u201cthat\u2019s super unfair to us, we have lives\u201d. I then told them to do better. I told them that its funny that I\u2019m just as busy, yet I make time for them - they did not like that. I suggested that maybe we can try syncing up our schedules or having zoom dates - especially since I hadn\u2019t seen them in person since MAY. Their responses to this were along the lines of: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna miss out on any shifts or change my availability cause I get paid\u201d, \u201cI need to study and work, I don\u2019t have time to zoom every week!\u201d. It\u2019s important to mention here that although I understand the importance of work and study, I don\u2019t believe I remotely suggested anything to do with that. I wasn\u2019t suggesting that they compromise their work hours for me. Rather, put effort in engaging in the friendship. It gets so very lonely holding up the friendship on my own.\n\nIt hurts to feel like I\u2019m the only one who values the relationship enough to want to put in effort or seek compromises. But I also feel like an ass for asking them to do better by trying to reach out - especially because I know how busy life gets.\n\nAITA?"

We began dating when I was 20 and eloped about two years ago.\n\nBen's an extremely (private?) aloof person. I still don't know a lot of things about his past, except for the fact that he carries a lot of unresolved baggage. I don't really push him for details, since I've always figured that he'll just tell me if he ever wants to. He's kind of a quiet tough guy too, which is why his reaction took me off guard.\n\nI've seen him writing in a notebook before bed for these past few weeks, but he got flustered and put it away when I asked what it was, so I didn't mention it again. I did a bit of late work last night so he went to sleep first, and when I went into the room he had left the notebook out on the bed. I picked it up to put it away but curiosity got the best of me and I reopened it to the first page, assuming that it's probably something mundane if he fell asleep with it out. I was wrong, it described a graphic ptsd(?) dream he had and I stopped reading after the first paragraph.\n\nHe confronted me about it this morning and I hemmed and hawed a bit at first, but ultimately admitted that I did read it because I thought lying about it would make him angrier. He totally lost it, I've never seen the man this upset before. Like, yelling at me with tears streaking down his face before sobbing and storming away. I couldn't really do anything besides apologize and tell him that I didn't know it was his diary because he never told me. He's cooled down enough to let me cuddle him, but is verbally short with me and sulking. I think it's already a done deal, but parts of the situation feel a bit unfair to me. There's no way I could've known what he wrote in the notebook was that personal, but my friend called me a dumbass when I texted him earlier. Am I the A?"

Because of this,I started to live with my gay uncle and his BF,now husband who are 42 and 43 now,respectively. I knew this hurt Dad so much but I never wanted hin to find someone and he knew I would not tolerate this well(It was known that I had abandonment issues when I was a kid,turns out I had BPD mixed with schizophrenia) so I cut him off when I was 14,he had to give it up my custody to my uncle because I was a pain in the ass to look after and I was a threat to Sue and her kids.

Rescues here are particular with dog behaviour, and I also had criteria so it was hard. Then the pandemic and it was harder since everyone wanted a dog. My sister moved back in end of last year, and our relationship is complex. She has recently diagnosed BPD so dealing with her is difficult. I have depression and anxiety, which causes insomnia, which I've been diagnosed with since 2007. With the pandemic and being jobless, I'm not great.\n\nAnyway, after she's had a bad day and is crying, wanting her own dog so she can have something we agree and she gets a puppy. It made her a lot better to deal with. Although my mum and I care for the puppy whilst sis is working so we also deal with all the puppy drama. She starts early so it was affecting my sleep, and stressful over all. I begin to think I don't want a puppy or even a dog, at least not yet, and think maybe a cat would easier.\n\nI mentioned this maybe all of three times, offhandedly across two months. My birthday is soon, and sis suddenly surprises me on Sunday by taking me to get a kitten. I was murmuring my surprise the whole time in a fugue and end up coming home with a sweet kitten. But within an hour, I start crying. I was not prepared, a life relies on me, and I am on government support so money's an issue.\n\nWith sis so excited at having done something nice, I can't tell her that kitty blues hit me so fast and hard. I fall asleep crying because I put the kitten in the crate because I can't share my bed (not used io it and insomnia reasons). She got IBS because I was slowly trying to switch to slightly cheaper food and I broke down more in guilt.\n\nI'm guilty because my sis did something nice. My mum is in the middle. And my sis has BPD so I try and be understanding. She saw I was happier with the puppy around and wanted me to have something. But she did not think. Not of my mental state, financial state, the fact I'm already caring for her puppy. She found out this morning and went ballistic, saying how she'd done this nice thing and I wasn't grateful. I feel attacked because I couldn't control my uncontrollable feelings. I'm never allowed to feel anything towards her because we have to tiptoe around the BPD. She went off at mum too and left.\n\nI hate being in this position. I don't like giving back animals, (I adore them), which she has effectively done to me once before.\n\nAm I arsehole for having trouble accepting this gift?"

I have also been diagnosed with social and general anxiety.\n\nFor background, my roommate situation last year wasn't great because my old roommates were loud and messy. Our differences clashed and I felt uncomfortable in my living space. I didn't communicate with them about the issues out of respect bc they're paying to live here too and I didn't want to overstep bounds. Because 2 of them graduated and the other one moved somewhere else, I was the only one left. I didn't know anyone personally who was interested in moving into the apartment so I tried my luck with randomly assigned roommates. My new roommates, Andrea (19F) and Lexi (19F), are 2nd years and were roommates last year. I had no issue with the age difference bc I imagined they'd respect my space since I'm a senior.\n\nOver the summer, I DM'd Lexi since she was following me on IG already. She asked if it's okay for her and Andrea to have friends over. I said yes as long as they give a heads up. After moving in, I tried to hang out with them and get to know them, but I didn't really click with them. As long as we mutually respect our space, that's all that matters. They've had friends over since moving in and are a bit loud, but I didn't have much of an issue with it bc classes haven't started yet.\n\nLast night, Lexi texted me asking if it's okay for her and Andrea to have a \"kickback\". I thought it would be a small get-together with friends and some drinks so I said yes as long as they clean up and not be too loud. I come back to my apartment to a whole party with about 20-25 people standing around our living room, not what I envisioned when they said they were having a kickback. I run to my room as I feel my anxiety rising due to sensory overload and have a panic attack as soon as I closed my door. After collecting myself, I texted a friend and asked if I could stay at her place bc I felt uncomfortable staying the night at mine with a party going on.\n\nWhen I went to my car, I called campus police to make a noise complaint bc I noticed the party could be heard from the end of the hall. I went to my friend's and called my mom. My mom suggested I have a \"come to Jesus\" meeting with Andrea and Lexi so I can set some boundaries. After the call, I got a text from Andrea saying \"Was it too loud for you or...?\". She probably figured out I made the noise complaint. I think I may have overreacted, but coming home to a large gathering triggered my anxiety and it was the only solution I could think of at the moment.\n\nAITA?"

Before my wedding I booked a bachelorette weekend with Jen and my 4 other bridesmaids (18-35F) which cost about $200 each. Cost was raised as an issue but everyone agreed to save up for a few months and said that it would be fine.\n\nAbout a month before the bachelorette Jen's sister (45F) got a cancer diagnosis and was given only a few weeks to live. Obviously I was sympathetic to this. It threw a lot of the plans off as I had to rearrange all of the bridesmaid dress fittings and there was one occasion where Jen cancelled on the morning of the fitting which screwed up everyone else's schedule. Her reasoning was that her sister could die any day and so she wanted to be within driving distance of the hospital and my fittings were taking place about an hour away. I eventually had to just get her to take her own measurements.\n\nTwo days before the bachelorette party, Jen pulled out. She said she didn't feel comfortable going on a weekend away when her sister might die. I didn't argue it because I thought that was fair, I couldn't really argue that she should leave her sister. The rest of us all went and had a good time. Jen's sister did sadly pass away a few days later.\n\nOn my wedding day a few months later Jen was acting really weird. She didn't speak to me and was very grouchy. Eventually she left the wedding early without even saying goodbye. I asked another bridesmaid what was going on and she said that Jen didn't feel that I had been supportive of her by 'hassling' her about attending bridesmaid fittings while her sister was dying and texting her too much about the wedding, even though I only did that because it was imminent. Another example the bridesmaid gave was that I didn't offer to give Jen her $200 back for the bachelorette she couldn't attend. I was surprised to hear that this was an issue. My reasoning was that if Jen got her money back then either me or everyone else would need to pay extra to cover it which seemed unfair when it was no-one else's fault that Jen couldn't go.\n\nI haven't spoken to Jen in 3 years since the wedding and sometimes I wonder if I should have just given her the money back."

Students there have to be good at both academics and extracurriculars. It's really hard to get into, but 2 years ago, in grade 9, Alex got in. Unfortunately, Dexter, because his grades weren't as good as they needed to be, he had to take an entrance exam, and he didn't pass. He was always pretty pissed about it, especially seeing as his brother got in without an entrance exam.\n\nHe worked really hard and last year he managed to pass the entrance exam and get into the school. By this point Alex is an established member of the school whilst Dexter is the new kid. Dexter pretty much wanted to join Alex's friend group, but pretty no one liked him. Not mean or anything, but it's just that their personalities didn't mesh well.\n\nDexter has pretty much followed this group around for the whole time he has been at the school, which makes Alex and the rest of the group unhappy. tbh Dexter wasn't exactly happy either, because pretty much everyone compared him to his brother, and that wasn't the best look for him. He is still adjusting to the new system, and new school, so his grades aren't great.\n\nNow, Alex plays at a football club, which has 2 teams for his age group, a recreational team, which will take anyone for training, and selects most players to play, and a competitive, first team, which is selective and only takes players who are good enough and fit their needs as a team. This team, for some reason, gives out trials leniently.\n\nRecently, Dexter wanted to spend more time with his brother to hopefully bond and get accepted into his friend group and by the rest of the school. So, he decided to sign up for this team. He had to try out for the recreational team first. That trial didn't go amazingly, and the coaches told him that they didn't think he should try out for the first team. He managed to get them to give him a first team trial, so he was gonna train with Alex's team.\n\nLike I said, this is a very good, and competitive team, and Dexter isn't the best footballer in the world.  In short, the other players were really pissed at him for being that bad. The coaches told him he could go train with the under 12s.\n\nIt all blew up when close to the end of training, they were having a practise match. Dexter messed up a simple pass and a couple players got pissed and yelled at him, asking him why he even showed up to the training if he was this bad that he messed up basic things. Alex was also looking angry, but didn't say anything. Needless to say it was humiliating for Dexter, and a few of the players on that team also go to the same school, so word got around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point of contention is that Dexter wants me punish Alex for not defending him and being a bad brother. I told him I will not, to which he is saying that I am favouring him, and he's been switching between hounding me and giving me the silent treatment ever since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?"

So basically, I refill o2 tanks. My workspace is a small garage filled with big tanks for refill with metal pipes and valves, we only allow 2 people to come in and the rest have to wait outside and make a line.\n\nThe queue people make is a line of tanks, they drop their empty tanks and leave it there, then they search for a place to sit and wait or protect themselves from hot sunlight. When the line moves up they move their tanks too.\n\nBecause of the pandemic the line is always full. Damn I even got the job because of that. With the full line comes a lot of people waiting for oxygen to give to their loved ones. My story starts here.\n\nAbout 4-5 days ago there's a woman in her 30's cutting the line, let's call her Karen. Karen did it without us operators knowing. The story was when we called two people to come in Karen jumped someone in front of her and she said \"he's not there so i decided to skip him\". Turns out the man she said was not there was walking to his tank and she was running, so Karen got to her tank first and with her logic she decided it was okay to skip him. We were furious and wanted to refuse her but luckily for her the man she skipped allows it and says \"It's okay she must've needed it\". So nothing happened that day.\n\nToday however, Karen did it again. So today is the day after Eid and there's a lot of people searching for oxygen waiting in line (We took a day off on Eid). So the exact same story happened again today, Karen ran to her tank and skipped not only one but two tanks. Granted, the girl in front of Karen was away to buy breakfast but when she realized someone skipped her she was furious and she went inside the garage, shouted at Karen for skipping the line (again, we didn't know Karen skipped the line). At the time i was the one refilling Karen's tank and when I knew she skipped the line I (dangerously) cut the pipes to her tank, walked outside of the garage and let all the oxygen inside her tank escape. It made a loud noise and everyone watched me as I shouted with the tank hissing on my arms\n\n\"Wait in line or no oxygen for you, your mother, or your father\"\n\nKaren ran towards me and she begged me not to do that. She said she was sorry and will not cut the line again. But I decided she needs to search for oxygen elsewhere, the other operators agreed with me and so she left with her empty tank. \n\nThis should be the end of the story, \"she deserved it\" and what not. But here's the thing, maybe she really needs the Oxygen for her loved ones, maybe the reason she skipped the line was because she has work to do to support her family. Right now I'm still thinking about the what I did to her. Am I the Asshole for emptying her tank and shouted that she wouldn't get oxygen for her family?\n\nTldr: Refused to refill a Karen's Oxygen tank because she skipped the line."

            "text": "(sorry for any mistakes - i wrote this in a rush)\n\nMy (15f) sister (17f) is completing her last year of high school and has recently got a secret boyfriend. They met through a mutual and met last month and got along. \n\nShe is currently about to sit her final exams which determines her university and its important that she does well. \n\nI had no problem at first, although my family is strict islamic I let her know my opinions and told her it was  her life and I wasn't going to meddle in it. Well that was until she started sneaking out.\n\nOn some days she finishes early, on the same days I stay back for extra-curricular activites until 5pm ish and she has to stay too. During these times she would sneak out with her boyfriend, not to nearby cafes or restaurants- she would go to the city. From our school the city is about 1.5 hours by train, giving her a fair amount of time as she finishes at 11. \n\nWhen I found out I was shocked, sure I had snuck out before but that was nearby and with friends that my family knew well (I keep leaving stuff out but my sister had told my parents shortly after). She had gone out with an unknown guy that none of us knew. I let her know that i knew and she told me to get out of her business as its her life. I've never had a lovely relationship with my sister, I guess I'm the typical annoying younger sibling but I just want to spend time with her. After her boyfriend came in the picture I could spend no time with her at all, she was always talking to him or face timing him.\n\nAnyways after that incident I thought about telling my parents but then decided not to as she was right about it being her life. But then it happened again, and again. She would beg to stay after school and pretend she had after school classes when she would be sneaking out with her boyfriend. When I found out she was sneaking out more, I put my foot down. She was weeks away from her exams and I have seen the effort she put into her studying recently- she would barely pass (she has been given warning by the school before she will not be able to pass in some subjects with her current marks). \n\nI went to my mum a few weeks ago and told her everything, she was disappointed in both us, me for keeping quiet this whole time and my sister for lying. She went to my dad (adding again - against my wishes, in other posts I have mentioned my mum is the softer parent, I hoped she would console my sister not tell my dad) and they had a long talk and then confronted my sister. My sister didn't take it well at all, she cried and screamed (at me the most) for ruining her life by asking her to cut off ties with her bf. After a few hours she compromised with my dad, they would cut ties until she finished her exams (so in about a month to be exact^^) and then my dad would meet the boy and approve.\n\nShe barely talks to me anymore (after re-reading this I was over exaggerating when writing this; she does still talk to me *almost* as normal but does give me some well deserved bitching time to time), even less after I confronted her about getting with bf again. I've apologised a lot and I get I'm most likely TA :(\n\nEdit: thanks for all the feedback and stuff I'm working on apologizing to both her and her boyfriend, I understand what I did was extremely immature and I hope to work on it in the future. \n\nEdit 2: I talked to her about it just now (yes very quick haha) and she said she is obviously pissed but understands where I was coming from and apologized for not trying to solve it earlier with me, I brought up my worries about her studies and her spending time with me and we both hope to work on it especially now as we are in heavy lockdown! She's also arranged a meeting with her bf, her and me after lockdown so I can meet him and hopefully clear up any negative thoughts about him...\n thanks y'all :)"

I told her no, bc I honestly don\u2019t know anyone since I\u2019m not a huge into celebrating my own birthday.

She even sent me photos of it and told me how delicious it was. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand and feel hurt that she\u2019ll invite me to certain things like the baptism (even though I\u2019m atheist) but not other birthdays. I didn\u2019t saying anything when it happened bc she just had a baby and I didn\u2019t know how she would react with postpartum hormones kicking around. \n\nWIBTA for saying something later?

Her family loves seafood so she had things like baked scallops, lobster tail, crab cakes, etc. All seafood options. Now this might sound heavenly to some people, but I really dislike seafood and the vegetarian alternatives didn\u2019t sound much better so I asked my friend if I could just bring my own food.\n\nShe said yes. Nice! At the dinner reception after the wedding, I ordered some burgers from a popular fast food chain to be delivered. Not going to say which one but there\u2019s only a few that you can really guess. \n\nAnyhow, as I was eating my food, everyone just kept side eyeing me. I know I probably looked weird, eating a fast food hamburger while everyone else ate scallops and stuff, but I also felt like I was being majorly judged. My friend (the bride) also gave me that weird side eye at some point.  \n\nAfter the dinner portion was over and people started dancing/socializing more, one of the bridesmaids told me that it would have been more \u201cproper\u201d to eat something that \u201cdidn\u2019t draw so much attention.\u201d So I guess she was referring to the paper bag and drink I had since it did kind of stand out. \n\nNot a big deal but I don\u2019t know, I guess the comment just got me thinking.

We mostly spend time gaming with our friend group. \n\nWe usually have a similar level of skill when gaming as a group, save for the friend in question.

I get angry, get REALLY salty (excessive self criticism, jealousy, resentment, and more) and overall be an unfun person to deal with because of the saltiness. He seems to not care in the slightest which makes me even more mad.\n\nI told to him multiple times that he makes me feel bad. He says no one else seems to care and (indirectly) I should learn to take it.\nHe then doesn't change, but instead jokingly puts me down at every opportunity. I don't see a particular dislike though, he still talks to me. But when I ask him a question, he generally doesn't respond. He has said to me before that my saltiness and excessive complaining makes me an unfun person.

            "text": "Me (25f) and my husband (27m) have been married for 3 years now. My husband is the oldest of three sons and me and my MIL have a great relationship - I absolutely adore her and the rest of the family, and  I love that we share common values when it comes to family.\n\nMy second oldest brother in law recently got married and although his new wife is very sweet, her and my MIL\u2019s relationship (along with the relationship between their families) has not gone as smoothly as we all hoped. Needless to say my MIL did not 100% enjoy dealing with her or her family during the wedding planning process. But now they are married so we all just need to move forward. \n\nImportant thing to note: We are Muslim and if someone in our family is interested in a potential partner, that is a big deal and we would only hear about the potential partner once the person is ready to take next step (marriage!). It is normal to be in the talking phase for up to a year before they tell their family, at which point they would have to start making arrangements to be engaged.\n\nMy new SIL recently told me that she played matchmaker (during her wedding!) for our MIL\u2019s third and youngest son, who is single. She thought it would be a good idea to match him with her cousin. I was excited to hear that my youngest BIL was talking to someone, but when I had time to think about it I realized I\u2019m not too thrilled with the idea that it\u2019s her cousin. Given the fact that her and my husbands family struck a few pain points and are not off to a super great start, I know my MIL would not be super thrilled with this news either. I also thought about what this would mean for me and I can\u2019t help but feel a little jealous or potentially left out if both of my BILs ended up marrying into the same family. I love my sister in law but she does not hang out with our family very often and can already see a little club that would only include her, her cousin, and their husbands. I\u2019ve always dreamed of the day when we\u2019d all be married and have kids and would be super close, but with this scenario I know it just wouldn\u2019t work out that way - it would feel somewhat two-sided with me and my husband as the third wheels.\n\nIt has only been a month since they started talking (it also hurts that he hasn\u2019t told me or my husband yet - only his other brother and my SIL), so nothing is set in stone but just thinking of this potential scenario is making me feel bad. I know I\u2019m just his brother\u2019s wife but we are all very close as a family but I can\u2019t help but worry about these things. AITA for feeling this way?"

            "text": " \n\nI\u2019m a big believer in supporting worthy small businesses, and the idea of having a ramen shop near my house is a dream. I ordered their tonkatsu ramen via GrubHub and as I just finished checking out I realized I ordered their tonkatsu and not the spicy tonkatsu as I wanted. A mistake that is completely and totally my fault I know. I figured I could just call the place and sort things out but as I called they would not answer. I assumed they were busy so after calling twice I decided to wait for a few minutes to give the staff time to calm down a possible rush. I called back again and no answer, I tried one final time, they answered, set the phone down never even spoke a word to me. I said \"Hello?\" a few times and then realized they did it in an attempt to get me to stop calling.\n\nI hung up now insisting that I talk to someone, and I called again...Annnnd they blocked my number.\n\nI detest people who are hard or disrespectful to people in the customer service industry, I\u2019ve worked there and I understand. However, silly behavior like that is simply unacceptable, regardless if you\u2019re swamped or not, a simple answer and \"Hi, please hold for a moment\" would have sufficed, but they couldn\u2019t even give me that. \n\nAs I said, I try extremely hard to treat those in the customer service industry with respect, I don\u2019t want to be a crazy Karen, but blocking my number left a dirty taste in my mouth, and despite my desire to not be crazy, I decided to drive to the restaurant to complain.\n\nI get there, walk in and with a smile on my face and in a polite tone I ask to speak to the manager, the hostess askes why and I tell her, \"I tried to call the business and you guys wouldn\u2019t answer.\" \n\nI knew immediately she recognized me and she was the person who was rejecting my calls. She looks at me and says the exact words I was expecting \"we can\u2019t answer the phone, it\u2019s too busy\" she tells me. \n\nI slowly look around, realizing that the restaurant is at half capacity and there were 4-5 waitresses and hostesses working in a place that really only needed two maybe 3. I keep my smile and I request again to speak to a manager. \n\nShe walks back to get them and returns a few minutes later saying, \"they said that you can just talk to me.\"Despite her smug smile and the clear feeling of justification in her eyes because they were \"too busy\" I politely told her that I hope the business succeeds, but with customer service like that and blatant disregard for the people who are buying their expensive ramen, I\u2019m less optimistic about their success. It\u2019s unfortunate to see how ignored I was and how little they cared for the people keeping them in business during the pandemic, and the fact that I couldn\u2019t even get the time of day to speak rationally and calmly to management is just extremely unprofessional."

This summer he decided to take an internship for fun-since the end of May, well this means he\u2019s working there from 7am-12pm 5 days a week, then 3-4 days out of the week he also works a night job that starts at 4pm and can go past midnight. Every single day he gets home, he takes a nap. Then he goes to sleep at 9pm LATEST. I obviously don\u2019t want him to be overly tired, and I want him to succeed and do what he needs to do but I still can\u2019t help but feel lonely because of this. I also work and have school- we take our goals seriously and want to have a good future. I feel like i\u2019m being selfish for getting angry about this, but relationships need time and effort too or they fade away. Tonight I was in class and I was expecting it to be done around 8:30, so we said we would go grab some things from the store before bed\u2026 I was excited that we would get some time together even if it was just a little. My class ended at 9:20 and I said \u201cready?\u201d he then says hes tired and its too late, he even took a nap when he got home earlier. I lost my temper and I told him that it feels like i\u2019m always by myself. He then responded \u201cThen find something to do\u201d I stopped responding and now i\u2019m up, and hes asleep. I feel like it was completely insensitive for him to disregard my feelings the way he responded. I\u2019m starting to think if he doesn\u2019t think our relationship is worthy enough to make time for then why am I even in this relationship? Do I need to be more understanding?"

We're originally from the Los Angeles area and still have a lot of family and friends there so that would be the location.\n\nShe called me tonight to narrow down dates. I told her since I'm due end of November, I would prefer early October, specifically 10/9 and 10/16 (I don't want later than that since it will be so close to the due date). Also, Saturdays in general would be better than Sundays, since my husband and I would have to drive 6+ hours to return home. I have a friend's bachelorette party the weekend of 9/25 and didn't want to do 10/2 since that would mean I would be in LA two weekends in a row.\n\nShe told me that she doesn't want to do 10/9 because she has a wedding to attend, and 10/16 she has plans to hang out with friends in Oregon. She asked me if I could be flexible and consider Sundays 10/10 and 10/17. While that is possible, then my husband and I would have to take Monday off work so we can drive home.\n\nI got mad at her because I felt like she's prioritizing her schedule over mine and she doesn't want to cancel her plans and instead is inconveniencing me and my husband to accommodate her schedule.\n\nWhile I'm grateful she's offering to plan my baby shower, I can't help but feel angry that 1) she didn't start planning earlier 2) is putting her plans above my preferences.\n\nI told her that I was upset and that maybe she shouldn't plan it, and I felt like I should've said yes to the 2-3 girlfriends who reached out earlier offering to plan my baby shower (but I told them no, and that my sister would plan it). Also with the Delta variant going on, maybe this is just so silly because then we would just have a virtual shower.\n\nI also feel like I'm bratty and that maybe I'm the self-centered one, and that she should be accommodating to my schedule. \n\nSo AITA?"

They are looking now for my replacement which I will have to onboard.\n\nThing is, the job being dead end is not the only factor I'm quitting. The workplace is heavily based on nepotism and there are several fully-legal but tax evasive tactics going on (like owners paying themselves salaries instead of paying profit taxes). I'm sick of other employees working same hours but are long time friends of owners (think decades) earning 3-5 times more, but I excused it as a result of job/life experience. I am sick of owners son earning more than me the moment he joined the company, despite me having 2years experience in the company prior him joining. It's also sad to be pretty much left out of other activities due to age difference and it's lonely sometimes. As accountant/administrator I always have to be inside the building and such, whilst others (sales managers and the son of course) go get their haircuts and other personal errands during work. I am also a result of nepotism (got the job without prior experience), my bosses are my aunt and uncle, but I get a fully \"employee\" treatment rather than as family.\n\nThere's also a lot of good parts from this job, such as if you work efficiently, you have a lot of time to do your personal things at work (without leaving your desk) so I did my masters degree and have time to write this post on reddit, etc.\n\nWIBTA if I tell the new potential employee everything, the good and the bad? It might hurt the company, but I am very fond of transparency in these things. If I were the new employee, I would like to be told such things and make a conscious decision."

They are 15 and 16.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always encouraged them to practise writing and scripting by creating alternate storylines or endings for existing shows. It's a great way to practise and it's always been fun for them to put their own spin on worlds that are already established.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, my older daughter decided that she wanted to start writing her own show, which I thought would be great. Younger one also thought it'd be fun so they both started work on their own individual projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy older daughter began work on 2 projects, one was a show about a counter terrorism ghost team, and the other, as silly as it sounds, was about an academy where people with superpowers train.

She wrote 6 episodes, which is pretty good. However, her story was, in my opinion, quite poor. She wrote several characters, all of whom lacked depth or personality. None of them had any identifiable personality traits, like being arrogant, or ambitious. They all just seemed to say whatever that episode's plot needed them to say. There is no overarching plot, and each episode is completely independent. No visible character growth over the 6 episodes she wrote. It reminded me of those Disney channel shows which are made for kids, like Jessie, or Liv and Maddie. Except, it was meant to be a very mature show. The content seemed childish and repetitive, meanwhile the language used seemed aimed towards older teens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy older daughter, firstly wrote a planning document, and also managed to write 5 episodes for her first season. She's managed to plan arcs for her characters all the way till her 4th season. I told her to make sure she's not getting ahead of herself, but she's got a skeleton structure for seasons 1-3 as well. Her story seems interesting, and I can already look at each character feel like they're individuals. They all have different personalities and I can already see that some of them have begun their arcs. There's also a ton of foreshadowing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told both my daughter what I thought of their work separately. I did my best to be polite and kind with younger daughter, but there was just so much wrong with the show that it may well have felt like I was nitpicking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my older daughter and praised her about how good her show was, but younger was snooping and eavesdropped. She blew a fuse and started crying about favouritism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for my feedback on their shows?"

She wouldn't let me because it cost a lot to move me in. Instead I texted my older sister and explained the situation.

I heard him mention it before but I didn't know it was so soon. So I compromised, I said then I would leave in a week. Enough time for him have his surgery &amp; a few days of me caring for him.\n\nHe said that I was pathetic for wanting to leave over a small disagreement &amp; the argument got invoked all over again &amp; after trying to defend myself I asked him if he even supported me being enby or if he just pretended so he could write me off on his taxes &amp; he didn't answer &amp; continued his rant.

AITA for telling my parents &amp; a mutual close friend about a scary medical situation that affects my husband? Did I assume wrong that stuff like this is typically relayed to the inner familial circle? If I can't talk to the inner circle, who do I talk to &amp; when? After he dies of a disease? He did not tell his surviving family member (aunt) about it &amp; that should have been a clue for me. She coincidentally just went through a major medical issue herself that we have both been in the loop about for months. There were lots of updates &amp; details on her progress &amp; condition. Yet, he doesn't seem to want her to know about his medical issue. This is confusing to me. Was I wrong to think that family are involved in these types of things?

Ever since I moved out, their dog has become increasingly more sick.  She is old and has pancreatitis, but I\u2019ve never seen it this bad. \n\nA few days ago, around 5am, my mom called me while I was on a trip saying the dog is bleeding everywhere and she\u2019s at the ER now.  Later that morning, once I was fully awake, I called to ask how the dog is.  Dog needed to stay in ER for minimum 3 days for monitoring.  ER ends up discharging her early because \u201cshe has an appetite\u201d. Dog still has diarrhea and couldn\u2019t hold her own head up. \n\nI visited my parents today to check up on the dog. Dog was not doing great. Trouble breathing and wheezing loudly. I told my parents she needed to go back and the ER discharged her too early. My mom and I took her back, and it was there that they found the dog has an enlarged heart, which could contribute to the breathing issues. Vet gave a pain killer shot (stomach) and recommended giving the other pain med she was already prescribed in conjunction because they work well together. Vet goes on to say the dog needs to see a cardiologist for medications because it will lead to congestive heart failure. To this my mom replied \u201cWell she\u2019s got to die from something!\u201d and laughed. \n\nWhen we got home, I said to my parents (because dad always sides with mom), that I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re just going to let her die knowing there\u2019s something they could do. My mom initially stood by her statement and went on about how she\u2019s just a dog and it\u2019s not worth the money. After I argued how disgusting that is she said \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d just so I would stop talking. Then she brought up the next time the dog is due for pain meds. 8-12 hours between each dose.  This dog is laying on the couch trembling and wheezing, and she says \u201cI\u2019ll wait until 12 hours\u201d. I said \u201cDo you guys just not take care of her because it\u2019s inconvenient to you?\u201d to which my dad yelled to \u201cstop hitting us about this\u201d. The biggest issue for them is money. That and they are generally considerably less empathetic than most people I know.  They fall in the lower middle class range. \n\nMy parents then sternly implied I needed to leave. I\u2019m not paying the medical bill for the dog, but our family took the responsibility to care for her. That dog relies on us to do what\u2019s best for her and she cannot advocate for herself. I feel guilty for shaming them when I know money isn\u2019t perfect. AITA for criticizing my parents?"

            "text": "\nI feel bad about this, but at the same time, grading diamonds doesn't shape up when our family includes doctors, inventors, professors, and a former NASA employee.\n\nMy sister Queenie (not her real name) and I come from a STEM-heavy family.  Almost everybody went into the sciences.  Name any branch and I can direct you to the parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, cousin, or grandparent who was involved in that field.  \n\nExcept Queenie.  I hate to say this, because she is intelligent, brilliant and creative in so many ways, but she struggled with science and math in school.  She is brilliant at art and English.  So our parents encouraged her to go for an arts degree where she would thrive instead of a science degree, where she would have floundered.  And she graduated with honors.  We just didn't realize that getting a job with an English degree would be hard.  We were still proud of her when she got a job in the jewelry industry.\n\nBut I think she always struggled with being the \"black sheep\" of our family and being the only one without a career in science.  Especially last year or whenever everybody was talking about what their work was doing at Thanksgiving.  \n\nWell, in the last year Queenie enrolled in some courses and became a certified gemologist.  I'm really proud of her for this.  Her self-esteem has really improved since she got certified.  \n\nAnd here's the part where maybe I should have kept my big fat mouth shut.  \n\nWe were having dinner at our folks place the other night.  Queenie and I were on the porch with beer and shooting the shit.  She was gushing about her new work as a gemologist when she brought up how accomplished she feels and is comparable to everybody else in the family now as a \"woman in STEM.\"  \n\nI respectfully disagreed with her on the 'woman of STEM' part because gemology isn't really a science.  Queenie's job now includes conducting quality control on her company's diamond stock in addition to selling the finished pieces.  Her certification wasn't as involved or as intense as what most of us went through, which included years of graduate school on top of internships and research expeditions.  There's not much of a science on determining if a diamond is good enough to place in a brooch.  Not when our cousins include doctors, nurses, researchers, chemists, and even an engineer for Tesla!\n\nLong story short, Queenie is now furious with me and refuses to even look at me anymore.  My parents are also pissed at me, though most of the extended family does think that gemology isn't a true scientific field.  Her job is selling finished, finely cut over priced minerals to a clientele that believes in the deBeers lie.\n\nTo me, gemology isn't really a legit scientific field.  It's more akin to analyzing properties in crystals and gemstones to determine if it can be sold for thousands of dollars.  It's like our crazy \"astrologer\" aunt who sells natal charts as a side hustle.  AITA?"

I was a picky eater so she would often feed me herself until I was 7. I was the skinny short kid that wore glasses who also had a lisp so I was really quiet in the 1st and 2nd grade, causing her to often be called in by my teacher. I had a lazy eye so I had to get surgery to fix it. I also was allowed braces, to choose a laptop for myself when I was 10 and was allowed 1 year of taekwondo training. \n\nMy argument was that everything she buys for me is worse than my sister. I have an Inspiron while she has an XPS, an iPhone 7 plus with 32gb while she has an X with 256, $30 clothes and shoes while her's are worth 70. Not to mention she recently got an iPad Pro and we also share a room. My mom's excuse was that because my grades are a lot worse than her's. Other than that she also told me how much I complain about her food, and that I don't do anything. \n\nMy mom's a huge hypocrite she doesn't let me cook for myself or do anything. She tried to help her case by saying that I could just ask her to make whatever food I want, despite her refusing to make anything that requires more than 3 steps or is outside of Vietnamese cuisine which when you don't factor in fry food is only around 15 dishes. Other than that she would guilt trip me if I asked for anything, by complaining every day about how expensive it was or would be."

Anyways, I've been living here with my friend for 6 months now, and over the last couple months, I started having allergic reactions around the house. It never made sense to me, and I'm kinda a dummy, but one day after one of my roomies got back from work and hopped on Xbox live to play Apex with me, I realized my symptoms started when he got home, and it felt just like my cat allergies! So I had like a Jimmy Neutron brain blast, and asked him of they had a cat at work. He filled me in and said one of their coworkers found a stray on the way home and took it to their office. And now the feed and take care of it. Which is great, good for the cat, but would it be rude of me to ask for them to have that co-worker take it home? It's possible they won't even do anything about it. Every time I ask if they saw the cat after they get home and my allergy attack starts, they kinda shrug it off and say \"sorry man, it's a great emotional support pet.\" For me it sucks though, cause they keep bringing cat dandruff in and it's like living with a cat."

            "text": "My husband and I, both 50, first got married at 18. We had a baby (Adam, now 30) and got divorced soon after. We definitely weren't ready for married life or parenthood, but we worked better as co-parents than as a couple, so that's how things were for ten years afterwards, during which time my husband had a child with someone else. When his daughter (Stella, now 24) was 4, we got together again and now we've been married for 18 years and have one more kid. Stella has split her time between our house and her mother's since she was 5, but she's lived with us full time since she was 18. Where we are, it's quite common for adult children to live with their parents until they're financially stable or want to move in with someone. Adam lived with us until he got married at 27 and Stella still lives with us. Stella wasn't very good with money when she started working, so we started charging her for \"rent\" to help her save (she knows it's because of that and that we put the money on a savings account for her). We never did this with Adam, because he was always responsible with his finances.\n\nAdam now lives about one hour away and has a baby. He works 4 days a week and his wife is still on maternity leave so when he has his off days in a row, they come to stay with us. These days don't always fall on weekends. The problem here is that Stella works from home and she sometimes needs to work nights. Some of these nights have fallen on days Adam is here. The last time it happened, Stella got extremely upset because the baby cried a lot and her boss said on a call it was \"unprofessional\". So, she asked us if it was possible for Adam not to come when she has to work nights. We told her no, as Adam is only able to come here when his work allows and we don't want to have to make his stays even rarer. We don't have any more available bedrooms she could move into, so we said that the best we could do was try to convert a part of our garage into a little workstation for her. She got really angry again, because she says the garage isn't comfortable and she shouldn't have to move her workspace just because Adam stays here occasionally. We told her she could work from there only occasionally, but since she has a lot of cables, monitors, devices, things, she says that's not feasible. So, we had this huge fight where we told her this was take it or leave it and she started accusing us of favoring Adam, saying we're willing to accomodate him more than her, that we charge her rent when we never charged him and that should mean she has more control over this house, and that we should be ashamed for suggesting that she should work in a garage. She then implied it was because she was not my bio daughter. I simply left the room, and my husband kept arguing with her, at which point I overheard her call us some not-so-nice names.\n\nMy husband and I were pretty certain about our positions, but honestly, her accusing us of favoritism is making us feel terrible.

So how could I have trusted her to help out with anything else when she didn't help with that one thing?? She also told me if I wanted her help I could have asked and she would have done it.

So on the one hand i feel like an asshole for insulting her and fighting with her over something so insignificant, but i have my own problems (long story) and it bothers me for hours, i spend hours arguing in my head. I don't feel like i am asking to much its my stuff and everyone has their coffee machine somewhere (i mean she aswell) and telling someone over half a year to not touch their shit is just not reasonable for me its my shit my rules. She doesn't even use or need that space, she just doesn't like it. I have insulted her pretty harshly this time calling her dumb and worse things after she started to blame me for things i didn't do before asking neither me or anyone else just screaming it directly in my face. I lost my shit then and i told her shit that definitely hurt her( i screamed aswell and we both said harsh things like move out and so on, she even cried a little) , i feel bad for that but at the same time saying those things was such a relief. So am i going to far with this? My roommates generally keep out of this fights, only when its a problem for everyone than they step i. So am i the Asshole her for losing my shit?"

            "text": "First, I know that's a bit harsh but let me explain:\n\nMy(f20) best friend Jenny(23) got her Bachelor's degree this year. I'm really proud of her because it's something I couldn't achieve that easily. Because of mental issues etc.\n\nThat's where it all began. She had problems to first find a job which was not funny. Our friend group helped her as much as we could. After 4 month of looking, she finally got one. \n\nDuring this time she became more and more frustrated. She's that kind of person who gets upset very quick. For example, she was waiting for a package and we could barely convince her not to write a complain to Amazon because it came one day late.\n\nNow's the current situation: Jenny and her fianc\u00e9 are going to move into a new flat in October. They were shopping for new couch and they've also found one. It's supposed to be delivered in October to the new flat because they don't have the space in their current one.\n\nThat's where everything went wrong. A few days ago Jenny got a call that their couch it going to be delivered next week which wasn't what they've arranged with the reseller. Her fianc\u00e9 went to the shop and got everything right. Seems like the company who's delivering fucked up a bit. That's something that can happen and as long as it's all cleared, they don't have to worry, in my opinion.\n\nA day later she got a call from a guy who also ordered some interior from the same reseller but got their delivery note with their names, phone numbers and new address on it. He called Jenny to tell her and to make everything clear because maybe she could have gotten his one.\n\nJenny got furious after that. She wrote a passive aggressive Email to the reseller and the delivery company because she was pissed. She claims that the delivery company doesn't care about data protection and that they are shit (mildly said). Jenny's also thinking about sueing them.\n\nWhen we were talking about that via Discord that evening she was so upset she was about to cry. Her fianc\u00e9 also thinks that she's exaggerating because mistakes like this can happen. I talked about that to my boyfriend because he's also friends with them and called her a Karen for thinking to sue a company for this kind of mistake.\n\nI kinda feel bad for this so I'm asking, AITA?"

It\u2019s built into our routine to spend time with each other in friend groups.\n\nMy boyfriend has a\u2026 let\u2019s call it, a very relaxed lifestyle. He spends most of his days on his PC playing games and rarely working. I don\u2019t remember the specifics of it but he earns most of his money through government benefits as a result of mental and physical disabilities. His parents don\u2019t break his way of living, since he is evidently capable of living for himself with his benefits. As a result, he tends to live as recklessly as possible with himself.\n\nI come from a background where I had to be told that not caring enough for my hygiene would have repercussions in the future, so I do my best to take care of myself enough to a point where I don\u2019t risk myself of anything that leads to a hospital visit. I do my best to impose the same to my partner, since I believe he is more at risk of health problems than I am with his current health status. \n\nCut to a few days ago, when we were both in a voice chat together. He mentions loosely that he hasn\u2019t eaten anything at all since waking up. This would be fine if he woke up in the evening, but because he woke up at 8am and it was almost 11pm at the time he said this, I thought that it was absurd that he hadn\u2019t eaten yet. No one in the VC speaks up, so I tell him to eat something, anything. He ignored my words and kept focusing on a game he\u2019s been infatuated with for the past week. I ended up leaving in anger, texting him instead, as I wasn\u2019t about to blow up in front of other people about this. \n\nOnce I regain my cool, I texted him a joking \u201chey, eat something or we\u2019re breaking up\u201d, which he would understand as a joke with deeper incentive behind it since it\u2019s not something I would say usually. No reply. I try again 40 mins later to give him a window of reply, \u201chave you eaten anything yet?\u201d. No reply, again. I could still see whether or not he was playing his game in the VC, so this meant I was actively being ignored. I confronted him 20 mins later with, \u201cplease reply, it\u2019s pissing me off how you aren\u2019t saying anything\u201d, which worked this time. However, the message I got back was being called annoying, which hit a deep rooted nerve in me. \n\nI ended up soft-blocking him just to have space to myself since I never reacted well to negative impressions growing up. I broke down about it, told two of my friends about the situation, that I would be taking a break and don\u2019t want to interact with my BF since he was the last person I expected to call me that. \n\nTLDR, told my boyfriend to eat something since he didn\u2019t eat all day, got told i was annoying directly and don\u2019t speak to him atm.

I've been meaning to buy more for awhile but never actively mentioned it to her, it was just something she noticed I needed. Two pairs were active wear, the other two for everyday. I usually just buy a pack from Walmart or something, so I was blown away by how comfortable they are. I was so blown away that I gave an everyday pair to my brother to try out the next day and I let him keep it. \n\nMy girlfriend was helping me with my laundry yesterday and said she couldn't find the fourth pair, so I was honest and told her I gave it to my brother. She was disappointed and got upset. I told her that it was a gift so I could do what I wanted with it, even if it meant giving it to someone else. She said she understood that, but she never expected that kind of gift to be something I give away.  She said she knew that it would be something I could get a lot of use out of so she wanted to get me some really nice pairs, and she was disappointed in me giving it to him when I could've let him try them on/recommended them to him and still gotten use out of them. \n\nShe puts a lot more personal value on gift giving than I do and puts a lot of effort into finding/making thoughtful gifts. She also tries to keep gifts budget friendly, so I could see the amount she spent being a factor in her reaction even though she didn't mention cost at any point(I was curious so looked it up, $90ish). I mostly just see gifts as items and I'm not super sentimental. Since the underwear was a gift, I can do with it as I please once it is given to me. I got excited and wanted to share the gift with my brother, so I did.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong and I think she's a bit silly to be hurt over this, even though I can possibly see where she's coming from because of the kind of person she is.

I was going to offer, living with him for many years and all whilst still being local. However I stupidly asked beforehand who the person looking after the animals was who had fallen through.. Lone behold.. My ex. When he said this, he followed it up with \"Your failed relationship has nothing to do with me\" \n\nI'm happy with my new life, however I can't help but feel this was an insensitive move from my own brother and it hurt.\n\nHaven't spoken to him since and I don't want to see him currently.\n\nOnly posting to gain general true opinions, if I ATA then fair enough i'll accept and deal with it.\n\nTIA"

Most of the people in this lab have much more experience than me and also came from Yale, Harvard, Emory, etc. \nI got the job and I\u2019m confident in my ability to learn quickly, but I\u2019m definitely not at the level of most other people I work with.\n\nFast forward to my first week: I meet my mentor and he is not enthusiastic about having me there. The girl\u2014let\u2019s call her J\u2014who I was essentially replacing is leaving in 2 weeks. My mentor was busy with another project when I was hired, so he basically sticks me with J and turns me into her shadow. J was clearly annoyed to take me on as a student, and it was never her job to do so. She doesn\u2019t enjoy teaching me and she is kind of short tempered and snappy with me. \n\nThe next two weeks are hell. J is annoyed at me for every little thing because she wasn\u2019t interested in teaching me. She glosses over things, speeds through, doesn\u2019t allow me to ask questions and then reports back to my mentor that she \u201calready taught me\u201d something. When I\u2019m asked to do the task in front of my mentor, I obviously don\u2019t know how to do it because I was hardly taught. He gets angry with me and praises J for being so amazing at the job, and then proceeds to ask me why I\u2019m not like J. \n\nIn the end I had so much animosity towards J not only for how she treated me, but for the way my mentor wouldn\u2019t constantly compare me to her, praise her, etc. when she had so much more experience than me. \n\nBy the end I was clearly avoiding working with her and I did not appreciate the mentor pitting us against each other with the constant comparisons and berating me. \n\nSo AITA for avoiding her in the end until she left because of the way I was pit against her?\n\nTLDR: my mentor was too lazy to train me himself so he placed me with his other student and made us compete."

I felt like she was just being a pest at that point, she was sleeping so perfectly then we were arguing out of no where.\n\nTl;dr gf got mad I left to the store while she was sleep I got back home and she stayed in the living room aita for telling her to go back to the room and go to sleep?"

Last year however, she split us up temporarily right before the two year mark, and we ended up resolving our issues and getting back together in the beginning of August. Fast forward to last night when she asked if I had anything planned for our two year anniversary. I kindly explained to her that it was in fact not our two year anniversary, and if she wanted to celebrate that milestone we could celebrate our one year in August. She has a family habit of ignoring issues and hoping they go away, I'm as sure as I can be that she just wants to forget the break ever happened. It didnt progress into a fight, but she slept in the guest bedroom last night and this morning I'm left wondering if I'm the asshole? \n\nThanks in advance for any feedback, first time posting here and I would appreciate honesty above all else."

            "text": "I work at a Charter school in my area and I work as a Afterschool Teacher there and some if not most of the students I have in my class do get out of there seats sometimes, go to another students desk and talk to them, be on the floor, speak out loud, speak over me and each other, etc... Last week, when I had my students at the gate they stand by to be picked up by their parents some of them asked how their kids do that day. I answered them honestly for example a student did good for the most part but was slacking near the end by not being in there seat/talking out. Another parent asked and I told them what their kid was doing like getting out of there seat, catching them on the floor, not sitting in there seat correctly, kind of arguing against me about what I told them. The mom looked at her daughter and said that they will have a talk at home. Those are some of the things that I had said to some parents. I know kids will act this way and I don't punish them at all because I know they're not robots and will just sit there and be quiet but I thought it would be fine to let parents know and mainly told the parents that asked and only one parent that didn't but just thought that I should just tell them so they know. After all the students were picked up, my boss tells me that I shouldn't have told purely negative feedback to all the parents that I talked to and that I should have told the other staff about it so they can come and talk to students and try to resolve the matter. I kind of looked at her and thought \"what purely negative feedback\" I knew that the feedback that I gave to those parents was a mix of good and \"bad\" (improvement that is needed) I know one parent that I talked to I only told them what the student was doing like being out of there seat, on the floor, sitting on there seat incorrectly but nothing that is really negative in my mind. I just kept going back and forth with what my boss said.\n\nThe next day, My boss told me that I shouldn't be giving any \"negative\" feedback to parents even if they ask because she worries that parent's might hit there kids when they are told about it and in a way I can understand that but at the same time I can't really lie either or just say that there kid was perfectly fine and there was no issue. She told me that if parents ask, I should tell them \"Their kid is a pleasure to have in class\" which is kind of bullshit to only say that but I feel like parents should know the truth and know how their kids did in class. I do know that I should be more mindful and also mention \"You're kid did good but here are some improvements that can be made\" or something like that so it seems more best fitted or a much more better thing to say to parents where I'm not hiding or lying to them.\n\nTLDR: I told some parents about there kids and told them honestly and my boss doesn't want me to mention any \"negative\" feedback and to lie to them or not mention it at all."

She spent most summer days on bed viewing Youtube while our parents were melted on the sofa because they are a bit old and household chores are tiring.\n\nI was going through a emotional crisis as I lost a lot of supposed friends (internet) for making public how they badmouthed another friend of mine (which almost fell into anorexia) and how a p\\*do was stalking and sending messages to an underage girl (which was playing with all the males on the group)\n\nI used this opportunity to take care of her and play with here. I knew how being alone felt and she was the only girl of the family so she hadn't anyone to play with.\n\nI have spent the past three years with no more social interaction than family and work ones (which are meaningful for me) and playing with her and her friends all my free time until night.\n\nIf I'm honest I'm a bit burned , not of her , because she is very sweet and talkative , but of mine desires trying to get out and do something different for a little.\n\nI compromised to take care of her when she need it and be her playmate (english is not my native language , sorry if that sounds bad) until she no longer needs me. I may have almost no friends but I really value the bonds that I have so I got angry and I yelled to her that  'I wouldn't care a shit if you left with your friends and never talked to me again'\n\nWe both inmediately asked for each other's pardon but I felt really bad telling her that blatant lie.\n\nNow we are fine but I don't want to hurt her as they hurted me through my childhood (I had a disfunctional family)\n\nAITA?"

However, sometimes they go to bed early and leave me in charge of tucking in my brother.\n\nThe last time this happened, I decided I wanted him to try to go to bed on his own. He is very used to having people do things for him, even when he knows how to do it on his own. Since our mom and my stepdad don't usually make him do things on his own, I try to encourage him to every now and then.\n\nBy the way, the light switch is right at the foot of his bed, so he doesn't have to turn off the light and then stumble in the dark to find his bed; he can climb into bed first and then turn the light off once he's already where he needs to be.\n\nWhen he asked me to tuck him into bed, I told him, \"I want you to do it.\" He was upset (which I expected) and he insisted that I tuck him in and turn the light off for him. I told him I wasn't going to do that. He told me, \"But mom always does that for me,\" and I told him that I knew, but that I wasn't going to do that. He said he was going to wake up our mom and my stepdad so they could tuck him in, but I didn't allow him to.\n\nHe told me that it's easy to tuck him in and turn off the light, so I should just do it. I told him that since it's so easy, he can do it himself just fine. I told him his bedroom is only a few steps behind him, and all he had to do was go to his bed and turn off the light. He started crying and saying he was scared, to which I told him that he would continue to be scared as long as he refused to face his fears. We argued for a while and he cried the whole time. Eventually I told him he had two options: continue to stand in the hallway and throw a fit like a toddler, or go to bed. He then said, \"Fine,\" and he went to bed.\n\nI don't know if I was being too harsh. I want him to do things on his own, but I don't know the best way to go about encouraging him. It's not the first time he's cried as a result of me telling him to do something. I feel like I might be putting too much pressure on him or forcing him to act more mature than he's ready to. I know I had to mature faster than I was ready to for a lot of reasons, and I'm worried about putting him through the same feeling, though I try to be conscious of the way I treat him. Am I an AH?"

            "text": "We live together - I'm trying to get back on my feet again after losing my job during coronavirus, and knew that this would be a rough adjustment. We have a complicated past relationship - let's just say he was a terrible and neglectful father figure, and is as a result estranged from my other siblings and most of his own family as a result. I've been in limited contact with him since leaving home, but it's increased since the pandemic screwed us all.\n\nOur apartment is comfortable enough, but our domestic conflicts are getting to a point where I may have to do something drastic to make him listen to me.\n\nI happen to be extremely neurotic about the way I like to keep my kitchen. (I happen to work in one and the habits have carried over.) I want the dishes and silverware rotated, I want the dishwasher loaded in a certain way, and I want everything put back in its exact place. I also do an extremely thorough job cleaning around the sink every single time I do any light work there.\n\nBecause I don't expect my messier father to do anything like this, I've asked him to please not touch anything in the kitchen when it comes to cleaning - don't handwash anything, don't put anything away, don't do jack squat, just leave anything you dirty in the sink. I'll do every last dish even after coming home from a nine-hour shift. In exchange, he can mop, sweep, and vacuum the place once a week, and we're even on housework.\n\nHe continuously doesn't honor this, and when I go to get dishes, I can tell he's quietly washed a few things and put them back without rotating them. He always puts back pots and pans in the wrong place, and I struggle to find them - much of the time they've been haphazardly washed and dried, too, and I'll have to give them a final rinse, or even a light second wash, because of his shoddy excuse for work. He seems to think I'm going to thank him for \"pulling his weight\", when he's a laughably horrible housekeeper that would get fired in a second working back-of-house anywhere.\n\nI, to be frank, don't think he is trying to sincerely help out. I think he neither wants to do dishes nor clean the house regularly, and thinks that if he doesn't do the latter, he might be able to squeak by with me if he takes away some of my workload by doing a dish or two.  I view this as pretty open disrespect - like what I'm asking him is some kind of suggestion that I'm just going to give up on eventually.\n\nWe had a huge fight last week, and I'm kind of living in fear of the next confrontation. I'm considering threatening to move out as the next step - or threatening to quit my job so that we're hurt financially and in danger of getting evicted. We're living on the edge as it is.\n\nI just don't understand what his problem is. I established accommodating ground rules most roommates would be happy about.

My sister paid for her own school and is moving to grad school in a new state now so she is currently unemployed and paying off a new car, I am working without a degree making 40k a year, I have a car, good for most people in my situation but not easy to save enough money to feel secure to go back to school or not live with roommates.\n\nMy parents are middle class, my dad has retirement income and my mom makes over 80k a year. They don't have much debt and own their home and several cars.\n\nBefore COVID my parents mentioned us getting off their phone plan but with COVID they decided to wait. So honestly have been on it longer than they intended. That said: When I was a young, like 18-21, I used the family data up a lot, so they got me a 1 gb  limit. I think the overall plan is 15 gb. They share the rest of the data. Since then, over the years I'd receive messages in family chat about all of them going over.\n\nRecently it came up b/c my sister asked me to map a location, I said she'd have to because I'm out of data and complained abt 1 gb data. She got a tone and said YEAH because you always go over it! I said no, that was a long time ago, I can't go over it because I've been on a data limit for years. She did this judgmental eye roll laugh and insisted even tho she was over not too long ago \\[this is a pattern, it's very older sister-little sister dynamic\\]\n\nI think this got into my head, reminding me of feeling  being treated different. I wondered why I am still held to a mistake from years ago or why not a evenly split limit. I texted my mom if she'd consider changing the limit. She said the family goes over every month, so she'd prefer not to. I said ok I'll look into my options but I don't understand why we don't all have data limits to prevent going over. I did type it with a bit of a mood. She never replied and I forgot about it.\n\nToday I got a family group text that parents have decided on a cheaper phone plan for themselves without sister &amp; I. This their way of not getting annoyed messages from us (me) about data plan and making less problems for themselves, which, ok, I get. I also don't mind paying my own plan, it's fair tho not ideal. I just know it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't brought it up, and my issue wasn't getting more money out of them, it was the arbitrary/unfair nature of the situation. If I'd been heard, regardless the outcome (like if my mom had said you're right that is kind of unfair but now that you mention it, we want to get you off anyways) I'd be fine with it.\n\nThey see it as me demanding something from them but I was just not wanting to be treated differently. It also is NOT a great time for my sister to get a new data plan so I'm worried she will be mad at me. Because of this I am angry at them but feel guilty/confused."

She says we could have purchased two decent vehicles AND a ring for the price I paid. Honestly it's not worth all the drama and I told her I'd return it tomorrow, but she's so mad that I'm not sure if returning it will even help. So thoughts?"

            "text": "Okay, I really need to ask this. I got called mean today for not wanting to watch a movie. Before you say NTA or NAH, I need to explain why I might be TA, because it's good.\n\nMy mother has been going through a rough patch lately. Her dad just went into hospital, and he's been very bossy and hard to please towards her mother. She's constantly on the phone with one of them and her sister trying to sort things out. That's fair enough. I think my dad was picking on her, telling her to stop being maudlin and stop talking about it because she can't do anything. I mean, I find it hard because it makes me upset, too, but I just keep quiet, don't say anything and give her a hug when I think she needs it most. She just said that he died, even though he's certainly not dead and it might still be a long time.\n\nThe thing was, at dinner time, we usually watch something as a group. I always try to choose something everyone likes. My mother had brought up *Cruella* earlier, and I had said I didn't want to watch it, but if everyone else wanted to, \"knock yourselves out\". In other words, why not watch it? I didn't have to. I suggested we watch something a bit light and frothy during dinner, or maybe not watch anything. I was just trying to be nice. I didn't want to watch *Cruella,* but if I watched something short, then they could watch it after dinner and I wouldn't have to sit through it. Deal?\n\nNo, according to both my parents, it was *Cruella* or I was being \"mean\" for no reason, even if I didn't put anything on (which I offered to do because I knew if I was feeling harrassed, I might want a quiet dinner). So I put it on, but read my Kindle instead of watching it. Yes, that was petty, but I don't think anyone even noticed, so it wasn't hurting anyone. It just happened that I wasn't interested in the villain of a movie I've never even watched and that I'd rather read the autobiography of a children's author.\n\nThe thing is, I've been trying really hard to be nice and understanding and sympathetic, even though her behaviour irritates me. Was it really so mean to not want to watch something and show some resistance towards the idea of watching it because they could easily watch it without me? AITA?\n\n(As a note, I will let you know that I pay for Disney+. I don't think that has any bearing on the story, but someone usually asks)"

I live far enough to where I can only see them about once or twice a year. The last time I did, I found out my older sibling, L, is getting married. \n\nMy mother suggested that L give me an invitation, but L said there was no point as I won\u2019t be attending. Their words were that I would make some excuse as to not going. NGL I was hurt that they didn\u2019t want to invite me. However, given that it had been years since I\u2019ve ever actually engaged with them and that we were in front of our younger, more impressionable, siblings I kept my mouth shut and let the day continue. \n\nI confided my disdain to another family member. Months later, I randomly get a phone call from the family member I confided in (I was at work and couldn\u2019t answer) then I get multiple texts. The first couple being photos of the handmade invitations from my mother. The second round of texts was from L telling me their going to need a headcount soon. Apparently I was a \u2018fool\u2019 thinking I wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding, but I know they only sent the invite AFTER my other family member said it was messed up. It\u2019s a pity invite!\n\nI already told my family I would attend. Partially because I think they\u2019re putting me on the spot and expecting me to hightail it and run so it would be nice to be able to one up/showcase my life without being bothered  by their looks/judgement. The other reason was because I was going to be able to see and spend time with people/family I hadn\u2019t seen in a while. However, I found out that the two people, role models, I was mainly going for won\u2019t be attending. (One didn\u2019t get an invite and the other based on personal beliefs/relationship with L)\n\nAfter finding that out, and considering my invite was out of pity, I just don\u2019t want to go anymore. If I pull out now I prove half my family right, and disappoint the other half. I don\u2019t want to ruin a special day by having people upset, but I also can see myself not having a good time in the slightest. \n\nWeddings are supposed to be fun, filled with people who have loved, supported, and helped the eloping couple. So, WIBTA if I kept it that way and didn\u2019t go?"

But the relationship is not unaffected. Since my grandma died and the funeral was quite traumatic and brought up many bad emotions, I struggle a lot. The last week things seemed to get better. But as the weekend came close I noticed that it really wasnt better, I was only pushing all the emotions away from me. So yesterday my boyfriend went to look after his younger brother. So he wanted to obviously take some things there and wanted to take my favorite bag, which I brought before I knew him. We use this bag for grocery shopping all the time and for nearly everything else. No other bag is as big and nice to handle as this one. I said sure he can take it to bring his stuff, but he really needs to bring it back with him because we want to go grocery shopping tomorrow. On a daily basis I am Always the one reminding him to bring and take all his stuff with him. I am the one organising and having everything in mind. We wanted to meet at the Store, so I told him, how important it is that he brings it back and that we also need it to go grocery shopping as I was already preparing everything for the next day. He Said he would remember. Today in the morning on my way i noticed how Bad I really felt and that I pushed my feelings away during the week. But thats okay I will Take time for that on the weekend. So when we met, I said okay lets take the bag with us and go to the Store. He looked at me and said I forgot it. I said youre joking. Sometimes with these things we like to Joke about it because it is so obvious that it is not true. And He Said No I really forgot it. We are Not that often at His Patents house. So we needed to get it back and we rented a Car for the occasion of him looking after his brother, so we needed to go there right then. He said we can Go there together and asked multiple Times. I declined every time. I think its not my place, i would have never forgotten it. As this bag also has emotional value and I am very sensitive and it took a Lot for me to get ready and get there in my current situation, this was too much for me. I said he could pick the bag Up on his own and go shopping alone because I am Not capable of waiting or spending time with him doing things that I have No strength left to do. Grocery shopping alone I was prepared to do that and I could have done it when everything would have went as Planned. But uncontrollable unplanned Situations are Something I struggle with. Am I the asshole for declining to go with him and letting him doing the grocery shopping alone even though we originally wanted to go together?"

Me and my gf both know the manager quite well and we have a good relationship with him. We have also hanged out with him a couple of times while off work so we have familiarity and frequently joke to each other or have small conversations when I visit. issues.\n\nWith all that out of the way, after the comment on the light issue, the manager politely replied that the decoration is not something he controls since it's something his boss has to decided to personally take care off. I explained to him how our comment was supposed to be constructive criticism towards his boss to which he replied he isn't willing to transfer our comment to him. After that initial comment my friend continued on commenting on the lights , elaborating on how it changes the atmosphere from a restaurant to an interrogation room. \n\nThat last comment set him off like a dynamite. I saw he got visibly upset about her comment and went on to make a passive aggressive statement towards everyone on our table by saying he is envy of us that our lives are so carefree and easy to live that we go to a restaurant and we care about a restaurants lights. That lead to a chain reaction and my friend exploded on him. They were having a heated fight in front of everyone on the restaurant. She was calling him out on being offensive and an AH for  assuming things about us while he doesn't knows us well enough and he isn't aware of whether we are going through something difficult in life or not. Basically without boring you with details of the fight, they both went on a rant on each other.\n\nMy girlfriend was in shock and was looking at me all embarrassed while all of this is going on and asked me why I don't intervene so they can stop fighting In front of so many people. To that , I replied that I think they are both wrong and both idiots for arguing in front of people like that for stupid and little things.i added that they both act like goats fighting over mating rights so why I should even bother. So after ranting for some minutes to each other they stopped and later , just as we were about to pay the bill the manager came back to apologize. My friend accepted his apology and it was a happy ending.\n\nA happy ending for them a miserable continuation for me because my girlfriend didn't let it go and still thinks I am an asshole for not trying at all to make them stop arguing and I should get off my horse.

I\u2019m 34 weeks pregnant and also healthy. But, last night I was feeling particularly emotional and physically in pain from working ( I\u2019m wfh until my due date but my boss made me go in to make copies and that turned into a half day event). By the time I got home, I was exhausted and in need of a massage. My husband was on his way out to his mom\u2019s dinner and he was expecting me to meet him there. He was disappointed when i told him i wasn\u2019t going to go, but he understood. However, when I asked him to stay back for a half hour to give me a massage he got upset that I\u2019d make him late and in turn piss off his mom, on the day he\u2019s seeing her again for the first time since pre-pandemic. So i suggested i get a massage from our mutual friend (my best friend\u2019s  boyfriend) who is a massage therapist in training, but there\u2019s a tiny bit of history between us so my husband didn\u2019t like that either. So to quicken the recount: we argued, he ended up being late, and after his mom called and he blamed me for his being late which resulted in me getting lectured by his mom, I told him to stay home and take care of me or he\u2019d have to start paying his own phone bill ( I pay his). He did it but then slept on the couch that night. Didn\u2019t speak to me at all yesterday. And tonight when i returned from making more copies at the office he\u2019d claimed the bedroom, leaving my stuff for sleeping on the couch. About an hour before writing this, my SIL (30s) called and yelled at me for not letting my husband go to the dinner. He\u2019ll be able to see his family including his mom whenever now that she\u2019s vaccinated but he missed out on the family reunion experience of the dinner. But i literally just needed some TLC.

So basically I have full access to her facebook, instagram, tumblr, you get the picture.\n\nBefore I tell you what I found on her tumblr, I need to tell you what my cousin was like.  Ariel was a hardcore tomboy.  She loved to work out, ran several marathons, and had served in her country's military.  She barely wore makeup, and I maybe saw her in a dress once or twice.  She liked action, fantasy, and comedy movies.  And she was kind of a jerk, she liked to make fun of me for liking Supernatural.  She was visibly bored when our aunts talked 'Bachelor' gossip.  And once said that \"shipping is for chumps.\"  She was the least romantic person I know.  My other cousins liken her to Rosa Diaz.  \n\nSo color me surprised when I found her secret fanfic account Tumblr.  Not Supernatural.  It turns out Ariel was STILL obsessed with Harry Potter.  Or what looks to be Harry Potter-related stuff.  I am not familiar with the characters she liked to post about.  But a lot of the stuff on her blog (aside from her cosplay pics, which is how I figured out this was really her blog) shipping fics.  There was a lot of fics and fanart she reblogged, as well as some stuff she came up with as well.  But most of it was shipping.  \n\nAnd this is from the cousin who said \"shipping is for chumps\" and refused to get married.  \n\nWIBTA if I shared Ariel's secret fanfic account to the rest of the family?  It may help us heal from her death and get us to better understand her better.  But mostly we found find it hilarious that our cousin, who was basically Artemis or Atalanta incarnate and hated dating and anything super \"girly\" would go crazy over something called 'Newtina'.  Just the fact she was obsessed with this pairing makes her softer after death, like I never expected this out of her.  \n\nI'm just asking because no one in my family is in the right headspace right now and I need a more sound mind to help us out.\n\nWIBTA anyway?"

            "text": "So this story requires a lot of bits and pieces of information, bear with me. First off, I should mention I work in fast food and this is my first ever job\u2026 I really don\u2019t want to make this mistake again.\n\nOk, first bit of info is the workplace itself. Fast food is very popular in my town but we are incredibly understaffed. Second: Yesterday, I accidentally double-dosed on a medication I have and was not feeling very well at all(dizzy, shaky, mood swings, etc.) today. Third: I am an artist and like to make gifts for people. Fourth: I have a brother with autism and he\u2019d been giving my family a bit of grief today.\n\nNow the story. I was not feeling well enough to work a 7 hour shift today due to the medication accident, but my coworker said she\u2019d cover for me, both seeing how badly I was doing and because she\u2019d done the same thing before and felt bad for me. I hesitantly agreed. I can work myself too hard sometimes and decided a break was needed, especially when I wasn\u2019t feeling well. After a few hours of rest, I was feeling pretty bad about it, so I decided to draw her a quick sketch, which took only about and hour and a half. Once I was done, I go and check on my family. My brother was stressing my step mom out pretty bad so I decide to get three birds with one stone. I was going to take my brother to my work(to get him out of my step mom\u2019s hair for a bit), get some treats for everyone else in the house, and also deliver the drawing.\n\nBy the time I get there, it\u2019s a half hour before close, which I also felt bad about. I grab my coworker real quick and give her the drawing before ordering the treats for everyone. I also felt bad about ordering food my coworkers had to make, so I tried to decline the employee discount, but the manager was too quick for me to stop him. I got my brother his ice cream but when I go to pick up the food, another coworker(not the one who covered for me) gets on me for taking time off but also getting food the same day. I\u2019m aware it can be pretty hard being understaffed, but even if I did come in that day, there would still be the same amount of people working. Besides, I\u2019d still be very loopy and likely would have to go home in middle of the shift. Plus this is my only sick day I\u2019ve ever taken so far. Since I was feeling better, I asked if I could get into uniform and help, despite there only being a couple hours left of the shift. The coworker declined, so I just went home. My stepmom was grateful for a couple minutes of quiet time, my other household members were happy with their treats, and my coworker liked her gift\u2026 but I\u2019m still bothered that I was selfish enough to come in to work for food on a day I took off. AITA?\n\nNotes:\n\n-I will not be disclosing the company I work for, nor my town\n-I will not be naming any of the people mentioned in this story, nor giving any more information on them"

I live far enough to where I can only see them about once or twice a year. The last time I did, I found out my older sibling, L, is getting married. \n\nMy mother suggested that L give me an invitation, but L said there was no point as I won\u2019t be attending. Their words were that I would make some excuse as to not going. NGL I was hurt that they didn\u2019t want to invite me. However, given that it had been years since I\u2019ve ever actually engaged with them and that we were in front of our younger, more impressionable, siblings I kept my mouth shut and let the day continue. \n\nI confided my disdain to another family member. Months later, I randomly get a phone call from the family member I confided in (I was at work and couldn\u2019t answer) then I get multiple texts. The first couple being photos of the handmade invitations from my mother. The second round of texts was from L telling me their going to need a headcount soon. Apparently I was a \u2018fool\u2019 thinking I wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding, but I know they only sent the invite AFTER my other family member said it was messed up. It\u2019s a pity invite!\n\nI already told my family I would attend. Partially because I think they\u2019re putting me on the spot and expecting me to hightail it and run so it would be nice to be able to one up/showcase my life without being bothered  by their looks/judgement. The other reason was because I was going to be able to see and spend time with people/family I hadn\u2019t seen in a while. However, I found out that the two people, role models, I was mainly going for won\u2019t be attending. (One didn\u2019t get an invite and the other based on personal beliefs/relationship with L)\n\nAfter finding that out, and considering my invite was out of pity, I just don\u2019t want to go anymore. If I pull out now I prove half my family right, and disappoint the other half. I don\u2019t want to ruin a special day by having people upset, but I also can see myself not having a good time in the slightest. \n\nWeddings are supposed to be fun, filled with people who have loved, supported, and helped the eloping couple.

For the longest time I can remember my mom has always been a light sleeper, and doesn't sleep well in general. I don't think she takes any sort of sleep aids bc she claims they don't work for her, or has been to a sleep doctor. Nor does she use earplugs at night to block out any noise. \n\nNow, if I have to use the half bath on the top floor in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, wash my hands, whatever the case may be, even if I am quiet (trust me, I've grown up with this forever so I know how to be quiet), she will 75% of the time magically \"wake up\" and come out of her bedroom to complain that I'm making too much noise and ask me to use the bathroom downstairs. If the water is running for more than 30 seconds she'll come out of the room, so it's not like I'm throwing a party in there to be inconsiderate. \n\nUsually I just abide because it seems rather petty to be starting an argument at like 4 in the morning, but I find it ridiculous that I have to go all the way downstairs even if it's just to wash my hands because she seems to wake up over the slightest bit of noise. It's not like I'm blasting music in the bathroom or showering in the middle of the night and waking everyone up. \n\nAlso, I do find it rather gross that we also can't flush the toilet in the middle of the night because that will wake her up too. She also has her own bathroom in my parents' room so it's not like I'm going to her room in the middle of the night to use it. AITA?"

All names are fake of course.\n\nSo, for context: I work as a cleaner and 90% of my coworkers are Spanish only speakers. I've been learning bit by bit but when I first started I sought out other English speakers to carve myself a friend group. This is about someone who I made friends with during that time. I don't dislike this person, and I respect their partner a lot, and don't want them to see massive consequences for a foolish comment.\n\nThe story:\n\nI made friends with Tim my first week on the job(I've been here a little over a month). He's a nice dude, but he doesn't catch social queues very well, he explained this to me on the first day as he has mild autism. That behavior doesn't bother me, I worked in IT for several years and am more or less accustomed to awkward people. Tim also has a boyfriend who works with me, John. John is also very nice and I respect him quite a bit, as does management.\n\nTim often spends his lunch with me when John is not around. On this particular day I guess Tim wanted to complain about some coworkers, because he just started talking mad shit about one of them. This quickly spiraled into talking shit about most of our Spanish only speaking coworkers. I was only half paying attention, mostly cause letting people vent when they're pissed off is a habit I picked up in IT when angry people call in.\n\nThen Tim, very loudly, said: \"you know why I love this job? Cause I can talk shit about all these guys and none of them can understand me!\"\n\nI shut that shit down quick. 1. A lot of them speak enough English to understand you're talking shit, and 2. That's a really toxic mindset. His asked me if I really thought they werent talking about me behind my back, and I responded that I didn't care if they do. It's not really my problem. I'm here to clean toilets bro. After that he said maybe I have a point and got quiet, and hasn't said anything similar since. This was also all said about 5 feet away from my other coworker, who speaks fluent Spanish and English, so I know he heard everything.\n\nSo I guess my question is, should I say something to John about the comment Tim made? I've been trying to find John alone but everytime I see him Tim is there or we just don't have enough time to address the issue. I don't want to get Tim in trouble with his partner by any means, but I feel like John will know how to address this better than I can, and hopefully correct the behavior."

She has a 9yo daughter from a past relationship and which has been relatively healthy as a weekend custody situation even though their household struggles but it hasn't caused much issues. I not only didn't mind but made it clear from day one that thats not a problem for me since I grew up in a separated household and would go into this situation providing what I can to be a good figure which I think has been pretty successful. Earlier this summer we had visited my father and his side of my family at their cottage and my gf and her daughter came along. It was a great weekend and I think we all had a lot of fun and during the course of that my step mother had said to us that her and (her/our) daughter had already been making plans to come back at the end of summer. We kept that in mind and followed through to plan another weekend this coming weekend about a month ago with my step mother and that side of my family. A few days ago we received a late call from her daughter who was excited that her biological father had planned another trip that same weekend to see his father (which in all fairness he just reunited with recently and this would be their second time going to see him). It would be a 9 hour drive so my gf says he can only do this on this specific weekend. I took this poorly since we had planned this over a month ago and he knew we had planned to have her that weekend. When asked the biological father apparently said he forgot. I don't mind that he forgot but I believe after realizing forgetting he could mitigate and find another weekend since my family looked forward to her coming. I feel it's been unfair to his daughter to do that and my gf didn't want to disappoint her daughter who now wants to not come to see my family but go with her dad instead. We've now argued over this twice which ended with what I thought was her understanding why this was important to me to build a future. Since then I learned though she didn't communicate that with him and they are continuing with his new plans. It has created a rift since then and that having her there with my family isn't being taken into consideration that I'm trying to build a future and I feel like she's siding with the biological father who hasn't done much more than is required. The worst part to me is since her dad said that she has no desire to come to our family event anymore. I feel like one or both or all of us could come to a middle ground. I'm really lost on this one and really not sure... Am I an asshole here?"

I was pretty disappointed - mom, dad and sister were also annoyed but frequently tried to explain it as **\u201cthat\u2019s just how he is sometimes\u201d.** They all attended my sister\u2019s wedding two years earlier. Wtf?\n\nAbout six weeks after wedding, dad died suddenly. It was devastating. Mom needed support and that included her brother so even though just a few weeks earlier they all pretended I didn\u2019t exist, all of a sudden they were back in our lives. I didn\u2019t say anything for mom\u2019s sake but she knew how I felt about it. I was assured by mom that she would bring it up when things settled down. Its not like I was complaining about it all the time - I barely mentioned it after dad died and was just trying to be supportive. \n\n2019, we were invited to cousin\u2019s wedding (problematic uncle\u2019s son). Mom and sister/BIL were invited to ceremony, wife and I only invited to reception. Wife and I decided not to RSVP and didn\u2019t go. It was an opportunity to be the bigger person but I was resentful. Mom was annoyed at me for that but I was annoyed at her for not sticking up for me. \n\nMom and sister would have ongoing relationship with them and I would have to make peace with it. Mom, sister and I agreed that we couldn\u2019t possibly not be in each other\u2019s life - but unless I got an apology I simply could not be in uncle\u2019s life.

I know why she needed her brother to be around and was supportive of that. \n\nThree years after my wedding and dad\u2019s death I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019m upset at anymore. Is it uncle and his family for ignoring my wedding and making no attempt to explain their absence? Or am I annoyed at mom and sister for not having my back?\n\nI feel like my feelings have been pushed to one side just so mom and sisters life can be easier. I\u2019m now resentful of mom and sister. \n\nYes, I could have tried to resolve it myself. But I was assured that mom and sister (who are now closer to uncle than ever) would make clear to them how I deeply hurt I was. I now don\u2019t feel close to mom and sister at all which is also difficult. \n\nAITA?"

She wouldn't let me because it cost a lot to move me in. Instead I texted my older sister and explained the situation. She always didn't like him &amp; cut ties with him when she graduated highschool. She said I could come stay with her for a bit &amp; take a train the next day or sooner.\n\nI told my dad I will be leaving the next day but he wouldn't let me because he has this surgery in a couple days that I have to be there for. I heard him mention it before but I didn't know it was so soon. So I compromised, I said then I would leave in a week. Enough time for him have his surgery &amp; a few days of me caring for him.\n\nHe said that I was pathetic for wanting to leave over a small disagreement &amp; the argument got invoked all over again &amp; after trying to defend myself I asked him if he even supported me being enby or if he just pretended so he could write me off on his taxes &amp; he didn't answer &amp; continued his rant. I said I would rather leave him &amp; live my life who I want to be then live with him &amp; hate myself. And he yelled at me \"then go.\"\n\nSo I left. I &amp; took a train within the next 2 hours to my sister's. I didn't contact him or my mom &amp; when they threatened the police I threatened them with emancipation (in my province because of my age emancipation is a lot more flexible.) My mom was aware of all this because he was on the phone with her while I packed &amp; she was mad but he wasn't telling her the whole truth. He was telling her that I was leaving because of a pathetic reason and he said I was just using him. I didn't bother explaining or defending myself anymore. I had a train to catch.\n\nSo it's been a few days now since I took the train &amp; I'm a lot more relaxed but I'm also having a lot of regrets. I have contacted my mom since (which was just a reply calling me dumb in which I replied \"Dad told me to leave\" because he left out that part when he told her I was leaving). \n\nSo AITA here?"

            "text": "Last year when covid actually started to hit our country it was around the same time as a major political event in a country near us that did affect (effect?) us, largely because most of my family lives at the border. My sister was following the news of both closely.  She's had bad anxiety for years and has never really done anything about it. I however would go out of my way to not make her anxious for years, often at my own expense. So when this started happening and she started panicking pretty bad about it I suggested she maybe watch less news and she agreed it was a good idea. But she kept panicking about it so I bought her animal crossing to help distract her. \n\nA few weeks after that I check her reddit account to see if she posted anything I'd like, we don't have the same interests on reddit so I only checked it once in a while. Looking at her profile I see she was active in all these subs related to the political event long after she said she'd stop looking at the news related to it. I was pretty pissed but didn't say anything at the time because I was exhausted with dealing with her. But she does this a lot, where she makes her own problem worse and doesn't do anything to help the situation while I do.\n\nThis was part of the breakdown of our relationship, we had our differences over the next few months and her anxiety kept getting worse because of additional stuff like her not being able to handle our parents selling the home we \"grew up in\" ( we moved there when she was 14) and being actually mad at me for not being upset about it. It all came to a head in January 2021 and I decided I was only going to deal with her at family events. She was not happy about this and sent back every present I gave her for the last 5 years ( except for the gift card I had just given her for Christmas but whatever) I had sent her money to buy the game instead of a physical copy so I assume she deleted it.\n\nI figure if she's going to give back all the presents I got her that should be included, especially since she lied to me to get it. But I might be the asshole to ask for it since her husband just quit an incredibly abusive job (4 other people left before him) their finances aren't good because he was the only one working, their cat had an expensive procedure done just before he quit and he hasn't found anything else yet. She told our parents she got a job related to writing from someone on reddit but I don't believe it since she has no formal experience.\n\nWIBTA If I asked for $75 for the game I got her last year?"

My bedroom and hers have really high quality ceiling fans that you don't need to run the AC 24/7 to keep things cool. She absolutely refuses to use the ceiling fan be suse it makes too much noise (it makes hardly any noise she just has sensitive hearing and can hear me blink from across the room). I bought a smart thermostat that has a sensor I can put anywhere in the house and control my heating and cooling so much easier and better and I even bought heavy, insulated blackout curtains to keep the sun from heating up the windows and that radiating into the house. \n\nDuring the hottest times of the day the AC never seems to turn off and then at night I have it set for a certain temperature that we already agreed on but I'll come home and its set to something lower so the AC can't even get any rest at night. She doesn't have to worry about the extra money for the power bill like I do and she's gonna have a wake-up call when she gets her own place\n\nShe pays one flat rate of $300 a month and that doesn't even cover half of all the bills combined plus she has 2 dogs who have free reign of the house."

It\u2019s about an hour long drive in between us. So I\u2019ll come up, stay for a weekend, and leave. I\u2019m in a really tough financial spot right now, so I\u2019ve been here often. \n\nLet me just preface this that we\u2019ve been dating for a year and a half, and although he\u2019s a messy person I\u2019ve been able to look past it. When him and his friend went camping, I stayed behind. I took this as an opportunity to clean the bathroom, because it was in desperate need of it. I scrubbed the tub, cleaned out any empty (I made sure) product bottles, and general garbage. I washed the filthy bath mats, the shower curtain that had soap scum on it, and cleaned the grout (which was filled with mold). I did this because I often feel dirty showering at his house. \n\nThey come home, both use the bathroom, and his roommate told me not to rearrange/touch his stuff in a pretty aggressive way. But then said he was kidding. He was referencing these open shelves they have, and when I was cleaning out garbage and dusting the shelves I put his stuff back in a more organized way. In my mind, the stuff is still visible but in his mind he \u201cwon\u2019t know where anything is\u201d (it\u2019s like\u2026 maybe 10 products that have all collected dust because he doesn\u2019t use them). \n\nI genuinely didn\u2019t consider that they would be mad at me. My boyfriend said \u201csorry it\u2019s disgusting to you, but you don\u2019t have to stay here\u201d\u2026 but the thing is\u2026 I do. This is how I can make my goal for the month so I can move. \n\nI\u2019m open to the fact that I may be the asshole here. I just didn\u2019t think that me cleaning the bathroom could be perceived in that way. I guess I just expected them to thank me? I feel horrible and stupid."

            "text": "I'm from Indonesia, so sorry for the bad English, on mobile so it's all messed up bla bla.\n\nAfter unemployment I now work as an oxygen tank refill \noperator. So basically, I refill o2 tanks. My workspace is a small garage filled with big tanks for refill with metal pipes and valves, we only allow 2 people to come in and the rest have to wait outside and make a line.\n\nThe queue people make is a line of tanks, they drop their empty tanks and leave it there, then they search for a place to sit and wait or protect themselves from hot sunlight. When the line moves up they move their tanks too.\n\nBecause of the pandemic the line is always full. Damn I even got the job because of that. With the full line comes a lot of people waiting for oxygen to give to their loved ones. My story starts here.\n\nAbout 4-5 days ago there's a woman in her 30's cutting the line, let's call her Karen. Karen did it without us operators knowing. The story was when we called two people to come in Karen jumped someone in front of her and she said \"he's not there so i decided to skip him\". Turns out the man she said was not there was walking to his tank and she was running, so Karen got to her tank first and with her logic she decided it was okay to skip him. We were furious and wanted to refuse her but luckily for her the man she skipped allows it and says \"It's okay she must've needed it\". So nothing happened that day.\n\nToday however, Karen did it again. So today is the day after Eid and there's a lot of people searching for oxygen waiting in line (We took a day off on Eid). So the exact same story happened again today, Karen ran to her tank and skipped not only one but two tanks. Granted, the girl in front of Karen was away to buy breakfast but when she realized someone skipped her she was furious and she went inside the garage, shouted at Karen for skipping the line (again, we didn't know Karen skipped the line). At the time i was the one refilling Karen's tank and when I knew she skipped the line I (dangerously) cut the pipes to her tank, walked outside of the garage and let all the oxygen inside her tank escape. It made a loud noise and everyone watched me as I shouted with the tank hissing on my arms\n\n\"Wait in line or no oxygen for you, your mother, or your father\"\n\nKaren ran towards me and she begged me not to do that. She said she was sorry and will not cut the line again. But I decided she needs to search for oxygen elsewhere, the other operators agreed with me and so she left with her empty tank. \n\nThis should be the end of the story, \"she deserved it\" and what not. But here's the thing, maybe she really needs the Oxygen for her loved ones, maybe the reason she skipped the line was because she has work to do to support her family. Right now I'm still thinking about the what I did to her. Am I the Asshole for emptying her tank and shouted that she wouldn't get oxygen for her family?\n\nTldr: Refused to refill a Karen's Oxygen tank because she skipped the line."

There was general anesthesia, stitches, etc.\n\nThis is the 2nd round I\u2019ve done, so i knew what to expect: throbbing pain and being stuck in bed for a few days as I heal. Since I was expecting to be wiped out for a while, i took a week off of work and told my friends two weeks in advance that if we all hung out, that we should do it at my house since I\u2019d be recovering. That way, if/when i got tired, me needing to rest/drive wouldnt be an issue. They agreed.\n\nTwo days ago, I wanted to see my boyfriend, so he got our friend to be his ride so we could all hang out together. The next day, his friend cancels on us, and because my bf has no license and no one else would take him, he cant make it. \n\nI get angry and tell him that this shouldnt be a problem and that he should have one by now, he\u2019s 22. He\u2019s holding himself back from freedom, working full time, and growing up. Without it, its like hes still a high schooler. He tells me he cant do anything about it bc he doesnt have a way to practice on his own. I\u2019m the one teaching him bc he doesnt want his parents to teach him, bc they are bad drivers and so are his siblings, who they taught. His sister could, but shes busy. His friend that he sees every day could, but his car has no airbags. I tell him that it isnt my job to teach him and he COULD be practicing with other people, and his sole reliance on me makes it seem like hes ok with making me do all the work, none of which should be mine to begin with.  The argument ends with him agreeing to practice some with his parents, and us going to bed. \n\nThe next morning, he texts me asking if i want to hang out at our nearby mutual friend\u2019s house. I would he been ok with this if I wasnt still recovering. So i told him no and that he should ask his ride to take him to my house instead since we weren\u2019t able to hang out the day before. It\u2019s a common thing for us. He says no, he didnt want to break plans, i should go with them. He tells me that because this 2nd friend is on call and cant leave her dorm, and bc his ride insists that they hang out with her we cant hang out at my house. He offered to get his friend to drive me but I explained again that driving is only half the problem.\n\nThis upset me bc 1.) I\u2019d already told them that wed have to use my house to hang out as a group bc I was recovering and they agreed and 2.) knowing that I wouldnt be able to leave my house and having seen the state im in a few days prior, he invited me to an event that I cant attend. \n\nNow were both upset and not speaking to each other. I think he thinks that im being unreasonable since i could come despite being tired since he offered a ride. It isn\u2019t his fault that his friend made the plans at a place that I can\u2019t go. I just wonder why he would invite me at all knowing this.\n\nAITA?"

We were driving up a narrow country road and met another car, the road was narrow enough that one of us was going to have to reverse. Fine, except for the fact that we had a trailer and the closest spot that we had behind us was a good 50 odd metres behind us down a winding road, meanwhile she was in a small enough car and the closest spot behind her was definitely much closer to her than it was to us. \n\nThat was only half of it. We stayed there and didn't move because it would be much easier for her. The driver gets out of the car and comes to us telling us to reverse, even though we blatantly have a trailer behind us, she's in closer proximity to the closest spot to pull in to make space. With an extremely conceited attitude, she tells us she has a neck injury and can't reverse it due to her injury. There was also an adult passenger in the car, who could possibly have reversed themselves. \n\nBack to the car, we waited about 5 minutes before we gave up, everything about her attitude was giving me a bad feeling that we were not going to be able to reason with someone like this, and we reversed, trailer in tow. Took a few minutes, and when it was all done neither of them acknowledged us. \n\nShe's driving, but claims she has a neck injury. I wanted to say \"Well if that's the case maybe you shouldn't be on the road\" but at the same time I wasn't bothered for argo. But now I wish I did. Maybe I'm more annoyed about her whole attitude about the whole thing, but she claimed she lived in the area and if she was telling the truth, the next time I see the car because I'll recognise her face I'm going to take note of the registration plate and report her. She has a neck injury and is on the road?! If that's the case she's a threat to the road and is dangerous. Maybe I'm being more vindictive because of her attitude but apparently she has tried this on others on the road.\n\nWIBTA if I took the registration plate of her car?"
