Frankly, I think it\u2019s hilarious she thinks she can tell me what to do or control my actions in any way, so my best friend and I decided to prank her.\n\nThe girl was sitting in the library at lunch where she always sits, probably since no one ever wants to sit with her in the lunch room. My friend had a test to make up from when she was absent and the teacher gave it to her to go take in the library. My friend and I sat at the table next to the girl, and I pretended to write down all her answers while she took the test. I kept asking her for the answers and writing things like I was cheating.\n\nLike we thought, the girl fell for it and decided to butt into our business. She reported us to the teacher. I had already taken the test, and my teacher could clearly see my friend and I put different answers for things. So she knew we didn\u2019t cheat and asked why the girl was saying this. I said that the girl has threatened me before that she will report me for cheating (which is completely true) and that I think she just likes to bully us and threaten us. My teacher said she\u2019s going to take action in accordance with the bullying handbook.\n\nSince there was proof we didn\u2019t cheat, the girl will probably be suspended for threatening and bullying, since that\u2019s the zero-tolerance policy in the bullying handbook.

I really love it and it makes me look really cute. When I got home, my mom said \u201cwhat the fuck have you done with your hair? You don\u2019t look good at all\u201d. I ignored her. I went to my room. I showed my hair to my siblings(18f and 12m) and they loved it. My mom again came to our room and said, \"You look like a monkey. This hair doesn\u2019t suit you at all. You look like a crazy woman.\u201d She was nagging and nagging. Even my sister got annoyed and said, \"it's just her hair, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d She didn\u2019t stop.

I am not really dying to talk to her. And this morning my father came to my room and said, \"What is wrong with your hair? You have got too much freedom. You are out of control\u201d.\n\nThe haircut I got is just bangs and layers. That\u2019s it. \n\nI said what I said because whatever I do is always an issue to my mom. The last time I got my hair dyed, she yelled at me saying, \u201cyou have got too much freedom. Who told you to get your hair dyed and who gave you money?\u201d I kept silent at the time. I never ask my parents for money. I buy dresses for myself. They pay for my studies. That\u2019s it. And trust me when I say this, I have studied through scholarships for most of my life. They are paying almost 4000$ for my undergrad. I even buy my siblings lunch almost everyday when my parents go to work without giving them pocket money. I always buy dresses for my sister. I help mom with dishes. In fact, I do all the dishes, every time.

Another thing that really annoys me is she is always calling between 2-4am even when I told her I have work and I get up at 5am and not to call me so late (she has never respected this boundary). On this night I snapped and I told her I was very worried for her and that she desperately needed to get help bc I didn\u2019t want to bury my sister.

He has been through terrible tragedy before, losing his previous serious girlfriend about 5 years ago. He unfortunately recently went through another horrible tragedy, losing his home to a forest fire. Him and his girlfriend are safe. They were able to evacuate, get out almost all of their belongings and help neighbors evacuate too. I cannot imagine how bad it would feel to experience the amount of loss that he has. Luckily, he has a place to live temporarily through friends and a great support system.\n\nMy FIL set up a gofundme, with my BIL approving it and advertising it. The goal was to help raise money for what was lost, what may not be covered under insurance and to help them get by in the meantime. I happily donated a generous amount, and I spread the word to my friends and family. I wanted to help, and I figured even every little bit would be helpful. Many of my family members donated generous amounts as well. The gofundme was successful in fundraising a solid amount of money, and I was grateful.\n\nA week or two later, he proposed to his girlfriend. They had been together long enough and are a good match. Everyone is happy that there is some positive news for them after such an awful situation. I am happy for them too.\n\nHowever, he proposed with a decently-sized diamond ring. I learned that he bought the ring after all the fundraising. He did not have the ring before the fire. The fire was the catalyst for the proposal. I told my wife that it felt wrong that he bought an expensive ring after asking for and accepting donations. I feel that the money was given to help him rebuild and get by in other ways. Of course it is his money to do what he wants with it, and this is rising from the ashes in just a different way than what I was intending to contribute.\n\nMy wife argues that he was planning on proposing before, and that he had the money for the ring already. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say this is true. However, if he had enough money for an expensive ring, then he didn\u2019t truly need a gofundme. In my opinion, he should have gotten her a more affordable ring considering the circumstances. \n\nMy wife sees nothing wrong with the situation, and she said she couldn\u2019t believe that I thought her brother was such a horrible person and would do such a thing. I don\u2019t, and I feel sorry for what he has been through. I\u2019m happy that he has some good news. The timeline of events with the fundraising just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I feel taken advantage of, in a way. I also feel bad for encouraging my friends and family to help.

So any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIt was my (48F) Birthday a few days ago and i was celebrating with my husband (50M) and my two kids, the day started out great but that changed around 11AM that morning when my husband confronted me about dinner - some context, usually when someone in our family has a birthday both my parents and my husbands parents will come around that night for dinner, I had invited my parents but not my husbands parents for a few reasons, 1: we had just gotten out of a level 4 lock down where we are living and his parents would have to travel to come to the dinner which are PM is advising we don't do at the moment, 2: me and his parents have never really gotten along that well, we are civil with each other but they don't like me very much. 3: i just want a quiet evening with my parents my husband and children.\n\nSo my husband confronted me about not inviting his parents and i told him those reasons but he was still mad at me and just walked off without saying anything, my parents come around and while they're here hes acting fine with me but the moment they leave he's back to silence again. A day passes and he's still giving me the silent treatment so i ask him why he's still mad at me, and he say's hes not mad at me, obviously this upsets me and we start yelling, i'm yelling about how he's giving me the worst birthday ever and how i don't deserve his silent treatment, and he's yelling about how he's doing no such thing. He walks away mid argument and go to walk into my room just to turn around too see my kids standing there, the youngest (12M) crying for me, since me and his father don't fight like this.\n\nWe just ate dinner and i was met more silence from my husband and my kids trying to stop dinner from being so quiet and awkward.

Though I will admit I can't say I'll keep doing it once I'm back to work. Found a good job that'll start next month.\n\nI've almost kicked him out at the encouragement of my friends 3 times, but I love him and if I kicked him out he'd be homeless and destitute so I always cave and let him stay. He's been promising for months to get a job, at the very least to keep up with his responsibility as the homemaker. Neither has happened. I found him a job in a warehouse where he could make more than double what fast food would offer (not having a GED limits him severely so fast food and some warehouse work is all he's qualified for) but he failed the drug screen. They said he can retest and when he's clean he can start work but he hasn't stopped smoking yet. There's always another reason or someone giving him bud for free. He goes \"you can't get mad because it's free\"...\n\nHis connection to bud is a beast all its own so idk if it would be considered relevant or not? \nBut I get annoyed with the situation a lot lately, especially since we found out 2 weeks ago that I'm pregnant again.

My dad (58) took me to the ER because I couldn\u2019t drive myself with how much pain I was in. He stayed long enough to know they were going to do a surgery, but he decided to go home and sleep before he went to work in a few hours. I texted my younger sister (24) about the surgery and how nervous I was. She and my other sister live in different states, so the first thing she asked is if Dad was there. I told her no, he had to work soon and she immediately spammed my dad saying he should be there and he ended up coming back and calling out of work so he could be there. My younger sister also messaged my older sister (28), who has been a little more distant from us because she\u2019s dedicated to her family, husband and two kids, and has never made an effort to come see me in the last 7 years because \u2018it\u2019s just too hard too travel with kids\u2019, and I get that. So I\u2019ve visited her a few times in the past years. Well she texts me too saying that she hopes my surgery goes well and she\u2019ll call me afterward.\n\nTurns out, it was a softball sized benign tumor that had completely \u2018killed\u2019 my ovary, so they had to remove both. After the surgery, when I wasn\u2019t drowsy, I tried to call my sisters but they were both too busy. I didn\u2019t want to send them what happened in a text, so I just waited for them to call me back, but they never did. \n\nFlash forward 3 weeks and it\u2019s my younger sisters birthday so I call her to wish her a happy birthday, because she really was supportive to me and we do talk a lot more than my other sister. A week and a half later, it\u2019s my older sister\u2019s birthday and I guess I was feeling petty and didn\u2019t bother to wish her a happy birthday. Even though I never complained to anyone how hurt I felt that they didn\u2019t call me after my surgery, my sister blows up talking about how rude I am for not calling her. But she doesn\u2019t say that to me, she says it to my dad and sister, and then both of them relay it to me. \n\nThen comes the horrible luck of my dad butt dialing her while he\u2019s telling me this. I said that I really don\u2019t care because she doesn\u2019t seem to care about my life or how I\u2019m doing. Well, she lets us know that she heard everything and was mad. She\u2019s been even more distant than before, doesn\u2019t respond to any of messages in our (my sisters) group message unless it\u2019s directly about her. And then she just sends pictures of bread she makes, expecting us to praise her on it, and they\u2019re usually right after she ignored a message from me.

She researched all the treatments, a couple of different hospitals, borrowed the money from me, which she paid back befor the deadline, got the procedure. She came back home with a high fever, and was sick for several days afterwards. I took care of her, but this was during the beginning of the craziness, so everyone was worried. We quarantined, cost us a little bit in lost earnings, but it was ok. \n\nFast forward to now, and well, I have and have had, the *opposite* problem for pretty much my entire life from about age 10. The problem is visible even when I have slimmed down, and even at my lightest, well... moobs. People have mocked me ***relentlessly*** my entire life for this. I recently found out that not only was it possible, but perfectly **safe** to have reduction surgery. I did my research with the help of a friend's SO who is VP of a cosmetic clinic (I did not choose hers in the end) and also my HMO. I settled on a place and I'm going to have non-invasive surgery.\n\nI have kept my wife informed **at every stage** of this process , from beginning to end. And she has not shown the least understanding or empathy for me. She believes it's not necessary as it's not a life threatening problem and she doesn't care about my body. Ok, I appreciate the sentiment, and I'm glad. But this ***bothers me:*** and the problem can be fixed.\n\nShe first began hassling me about hospitals - which one? Why? How many have you researched? How do you know that doctor is good? Have you watched the operation on the internet? What do people say?\n\nI answered her questions patiently, but it became pretty obvious that no matter what I said or did **a)** She does not want me to have the surgery and **b)** the reason for that is because I plan to have it during an upcoming national holiday, which would \"ruin our plans\" (we were planning to go to an expensive brunch on one day) but give me more time to recover. I even mentioned that although there would be pain, the whole thing would take 3 hours and in most cases people go back to work the next day, and in some cases, afternoon if they have it done in the morning. I have checked with multiple sources on this.\n\nAfter a consultation at the hospital, I decided to go with the non-invasive option, as it's slightly more expensive, yields the same results, and won't require surgery. She seemed pleased that was the case, but blew up when I told her it was $1000 more expensive than the surgery option. I went through the reasoning again. She finally accepted and said \"Well, at least we can go to brunch\".\n\nThat got me. \"So, the only real objection you had to me doing it in the vacation was because it would throw off our 'plans'?\" She blustered, rehashed the old ground we had gone over, I mentioned she was fine with it so long as we could have an expensive brunch? She kept going over the same arguments we had time and again, repeating previous points that I had explained to her. She raised her voice, shouted, got aggressive (I stayed calm) at the end of it I said \"I would hope you would support me in something non-invasive, simple and safe. But regardless, it's **my body, my choice.** And I want to feel good about myself.\"\n\nWell, apparently, that's only something for women to say, as men have oppressed them and controlled their bodies.

A couple of days ago I drove my little sister to get a physical exam, and she also agreed to get a flu shot.

Anyhow, everything was going fine, until the nurse came in to take her to the backroom. I went with them, and already, I could tell that the nurse was not in the mood. She had this very come-here-now and do-this-because-i-say-so-attitude. Whatever, I brushed it off as her just having a bad day/being exhausted, and didn't take it personally. She left and I stood outside while the doctor did the physical for my sister, and everything went well. I came back in before the nurse went to get the vaccine. I could tell my sister was shaky and nervous but she was doing her best to be calm, as was I. The same nurse came in with the vaccine. She got it all ready, when my sister asked her to give her a minute or two to calm herself down and asked her if she could lie down. This woman flat out said NO because she said that she had things to do and didn't want to waste her time. My sister then replied that she was afraid of needles and that she was a fainter. The nurse then said that my sis needed to grow up and stop acting like a baby. I was getting upset and responded that what she said was very insensitive to anyone with anxiety and phobias and she needed to stop being rude, and she needed to accommodate my sister, who was starting to tear up at this point. This bitch then started to raise her voice and told her to stop crying and get it over with,, or else she would have to hold her down and inject her. Now, this is something that I feel very strongly against. This has happened to me in the past, where our abusive father would come with me to my appointments, and whenever I needed a shot, instead of the nurses reasoning with me, the bitches and my dad would restrain me, causing a lot of trauma. I wouldn't be surprised if my sister went through this too. I then told the nurse that her doing that will NOT be happening and that she should be ashamed for even considering doing something so scarring and, yes, abusive. She then said that \"sometimes kids need to be scarred to toughen them up\" and that she knew that because she was a mother. I lost my shot at this point and told her that I felt so awful for her kids for having such a terrible mom. I grabbed my sis and walked out of the room, while I heard the dumbfuck yelling at me in the background. My poor sis was having a panic attack.

She said that i should go as GM is growing old and it could be one the last times i get to see her. And i should attend to make GM happy.\nI replied that i was very tired because the lack of sleep due to pain and rather spend the days resting and recovering and keep my health in check.\nShe kept pushing by repeating that GM is growing old and we don't know how much longer she'll be around and that i barely visit her. (GM is healthy tho albeit with some physical problems which she has a wheelchair for)\nAt that point i grew tired of her using this against me(almost every time when it's about GM). So i rudely applied that she should stop trying to guilt me into going. She yelled at me that she wasnt trying to guilttrip me but just stating facts.\nI then told her that it is a fact that she's forcing me to go out for dinner at a restaurant and neglect my health for a birthday to please her.\nShe got mad and told me to think things over and expects me to go. I just turned around and went back to where i came from.\nI called GM afterwards telling her i probably won't be coming to her bday because of health issues.

I told her i was still in cruciating pain and didnt sleep the past days as i couldnt find a position to sleep in and had migraine because the lack of sleep.

We have been married for 4 years. He always makes excuses that he's working overtime and when he isn't he says that he is hanging out with his friends. I want him home so he can help around with our 8 month old. I work part time. My mom is the one who watches my son while Im at work and when I come home she leaves. Taking care of a baby is hard by yourself and I want my husband to help since our son is his child too. I got tired of him coming home late and asked if I can hang out with these friends. He was quiet then with an attitude told me I can come. I tried to calm myself saying that Im overreacting and I shouldn't act like this. I hired a babysitter for the day bc I didn't want to bother my mom. We didn't really talk on the car ride there. When we get to his friends house it was very awkward. I wasn't really close with these people and so it was weird there. Everyone there was staring at me and I was confused as to why they were looking at me. The hangout was just a BBQ and a football game. Anyways when I finally felt comfortable I actually had a good time and met a really nice girl. She also is a mother and her baby is 10 months. We both aren't into football so We talked majority of the time. When the football game was over I go and wanted to see what my husband was doing. When I go to the living room I saw a girl basically cuddling my husband. She was smiling at me and gave me a smug look. I  got angry. He told me that she was just an old friend from high school. I then find out that they are coworkers as well. So my husband and I were having a fight in front of all his friends. Then a friend of his got tired and said that my husband was cheating on me with that girl. He said that everyone knew and that's why Im not invited to these hangouts. Everything suddenly made sense to me, my husband coming home late, his friends staring at me since they knew, and my husband lying. I told my husband he wasn't allowed back inside the house and not to come near me or my son again.\n\nI felt so angry and felt stupid that there was so many red flags that I missed. I was angry and I wasn't thinking. So I packed most of his things and threw them outside. Since he wasn't going to live in this house anymore. He's been calling and texting me but I've been ignoring them. I have no motivation to do anything now. My sister has been a great help and she told me that she's moving in to help me and my baby. Im planning on getting a divorce. I don't want to stay married with him. But we have a baby together and I don't know what to do. I want my son to go up in a house with both his parents.\n\nHis family called me and are saying that im a asshole for kicking him out of the house since it is his house as well not just mine. But my friends and family say im not because he's a cheater and he never really was involved in our sons life.\n\nSo AITA?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1632033277.0, "author_fullname": "throwaway283791328", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pr2u19/aita_for_kicking_my_husband_out_of_our_house/"}, {"title": "AITA for throwing up on my bathroom floor instead of in the toilet", "content": "Warning.

Of course, if a fellow coworker has a period emergency I am happy to give her a pad or tampon or a over-the-counter painkiller. One pack of ten pads costs like 120 out of my 20k currency (not US dollars), so while it isn\u2019t cheap, it\u2019s affordable.

Most of the house is quite messy, so the only room she is allowed in is the family room.\n\nHowever, I did not realise that they literally were going to refuse to have anything to do with the dog. This shocked me as they both love dogs. They refuse to play or pat her, or stop her from doing bad things. Some examples of situations where I think they should have helped out.\n\n1) our house backs onto the bush and mum was coming back from a walk and opened the gate. Dog escapes. I was at Uni at the time. Mum doesn't look for her or contact me. She closes the back gate.

He doesn't tell me she might have eaten the bait. I go to bed, but I come back out for a drink. I see the dog covered in vomit and poo, whimpering. She almost died\n\nI try keep her as safe and secure as possible but some things are beyond my control.

Long story short: the dog had chewed the only existing photos of my dad and his mum, which my dad had left on his bedroom floor. Dad went into a rage, blaming me and the dog. Everything is my fault because she is my dog. I put my foot down and said \"everytime she escapes, it's because of you, she never escapes when I am leaving, you never help, and mum had given me the impression that she would get the dog during the exam!\n\nI've spent this weekend cleaning the office of mum and dad's junk, so she can be with me at all times, even during study/class.

In another, I\u2019m friends with Elle (f16). They\u2019re sisters. Elle and I sorta hang out more because we\u2019re in the same grade and have classes together, but I really like Jane.

This started going around right when Jane and Cody started dating. He, the awesome guy that he is, didn\u2019t give a shit, saying that their sexual health is between just them. (Seriously, he\u2019s great.) Jane was of course very embarrassed. \n\nOne day, Elle and I were walking when she started talking about Cody. She said that he and Jane shouldn\u2019t be together cause Jane has an sti. I stopped dead in my tracks and asked why she\u2019d say that. She just shrugged it off! She said that it\u2019s true and it\u2019s why they should break up. I asked who told her that. Elle said that she knows cause she\u2019s her sister. I asked her who she told and she said \u201cI dunno, a few people.\u201d\n\nI left shortly after because I felt really uncomfortable. I considered what to do as I walked back to school. But the only right thing I could think of was to tell Jane. I pulled her aside after school and sat her down in a quiet stairwell so that we couldn\u2019t be heard. I told her as gently as I could what Elle had said. Of course, she was shocked and disgusted. She cried a little, we talked a little. But it was as private of an affair as I could do at the time. She composed herself and left for the day. \n\nLater that night, my phone starts blowing up with Elle calling me every name under the sun. Cody also texted me to confirm what I had told Jane. I did so without details out of respect for Jane. Elle kinda threatened me a bit but I doubt she\u2019d ever actually do anything considering I can hold my own very well. \n\nThe problem I\u2019d that since then, Elle has gone around and told people what happened and everyone is saying I should have just stayed out of it and not caused drama.

Not to mention that Elle started this by spreading rumors. I also told Jane privately and didn\u2019t make a scene of anything.I asked my older brother because he goes to our school too. He said I should have stayed out of it. But I argued that if he was going around our school and telling everyone I had herpes, you bet your ass I\u2019d want to know. \n\nJane appreciates that I immediately told her the truth and Cody appreciates me looking out for their relationship and for his girlfriend.

It was until after July, I felt like it was purely one sided. On the surface, my friend seems kind and understanding. However, she doesn\u2019t approach me, or make the effort to talk to me. She has another friend whom she\u2019s closest to right now. Let\u2019s call her Y. I was frankly jealous for a while because she gave me the impression that she doesn\u2019t care and that the months of texting was for nothing?\n\nI thought maybe, I was the one who was being too serious about this friendship.\n\nA few days ago, I decided to talk to her about that situation.\n\nI apologised, as always. I had many questions unanswered and thought that she would\u2019ve given me a reason to why she didn\u2019t respond. But no. Instead, she told me that whatever happened was so long ago (literally only 2 months ago) and questioned me why I brought it up. At that point, I just brushed it off because she did not seem like she cared. She even talked about how Y was fun to be around with and betrayed her? Yikes? Isn\u2019t that a super obvious red flag? Then, after some boring conversations (I\u2019m not Y, how was it fun?), we went home together like we always do.\n\nShe gave me a letter on my birthday. It meant a lot to me because I love letters. But everything she wrote, telling me that she\u2019d change if she ever hurt me and that she cherishes the time we spent together. They\u2019re obviously lies that I didn\u2019t see through. Words meant nothing at this point. \n\nI was really angry so I decided to mark her letter like an English teacher and send the image to her, followed by a paragraph of how she doesn\u2019t deserve me. Not the best nor the most mature option but I did feel slightly better. Then, I blocked her because I know she wouldn\u2019t respond. \n\nThe day after, she blocked me. Just what I thought. Immature. Escapes from all the issues. \n\nI overthink a lot. I also have attachment issues. That is probably why I made it seem like a big deal. I really wish I could move on but I don\u2019t know how to. Deep down, I still care. That\u2019s why I hate being the nice friend. The one who puts in more effort. It\u2019s always just one sided. \n\nThe building of frustration has reached its maximum and I\u2019m getting tired of this. I\u2019m angry, not just at my friend but at myself for even making this seem like a big deal. For now, the only thought that comforts me is that Y and that friend are meant to be because they\u2019re two horrible friends who give each other the bare minimum. Y talked shit about some of my friends and still that friend sticks with her like glue.\n\nI\u2019m finding better friends to replace her but the memories can\u2019t be replaced, sadly.\n\nThank you for reading.", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1632036726.0, "author_fullname": "ryezoid", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pr3hlf/aita_for_marking_the_letter_my_friend_wrote_to_me/"}, {"title": "AITA for refusing to give my ex boyfriend his half of the security deposit", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1632037249.0, "author_fullname": "rustygluegun", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pr3l6e/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_ex_boyfriend_his/"}, {"title": "ATAH for setting boundaries on my unborn child?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1632037491.0, "author_fullname": "Psychological_Sign_6", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pr3mr5/atah_for_setting_boundaries_on_my_unborn_child/"}, {"title": "AITA for setting boundaries on my unborn child?", "content": "I (29F) am married to (31M) and are expecting. \nMy mil has been somewhat stressful yet kind throughout my pregnancy.

A and S proceeded to say why they were annoyed with me and that the reason I was too werid, too pushy, and I just wasn't fun to be around with. They said I didnt fit in the group and overall cringey. They joked that I shouldnt be near them anymore and that brung me even more down.

Throwaway in case my sons come across this.\n\nMy son, Andy, (17M, FTM trans) recently came out to us &amp; we are 100% supportive of him. It was honestly a surprise to us because he always presented as very traditionally feminine. Hope that\u2019s not incorrect to say. But nonetheless, we love him just the same and are just happy he felt comfortable and coming out. He\u2019s was in counseling for a while for anxiety/depression but he chose to quit last year as he felt like he didn\u2019t need it anymore, and as he is 17, we don\u2019t want to force him to go. \n\nWe have another son, Josh, 19M. He loves working out in the house (we have a little gym setup at home) &amp; Andy would work out with Josh and Josh\u2019s friends wearing a sports bra &amp; athletic clothes. The other boys would typically be shirtless and would come into the house after to grab water, drinks, cool off, etc.\n\nSince coming out, my son wears binders and such and has now been wearing typically male clothing such as boxers, baggy clothes, whatever is in style for men right now. But at home, he\u2019s gotten into the habit of not wearing a shirt or anything around. My wife asked him to please wear a shirt &amp; he refuses saying that Josh is allowed to walk around shirtless so he should be allowed to as well. She left it alone to avoid conflict till we could decide what/if we should say or do anything. Keep in mind that he hasn\u2019t had any sort of transition surgery yet.\n\nNot going to lie, it makes me a little uncomfortable to see my former daughter shirtless all the time, NOT IN A CREEPY WAY, but I can\u2019t explain it. He still wears makeup every now &amp; then &amp; has long hair, and besides the clothing hasn't changed anything. I haven\u2019t said anything to Andy because I don\u2019t want to offend him or have him think I don\u2019t respect his identity.\n\nJosh has been on a trip to see his gf for past 2 weeks so hasn\u2019t known that Andy has started walking around shirtless. His friends come over a good amount to workout and I worry that Andy will get some looks if he has the chest that biological women have. I don\u2019t want to invalidate his gender identity but would I be TA for asking him to cover up? \n\nNote - Josh does pay us rent &amp; if I do set a rule that he has to wear a shirt too then it might cause conflict. And the other boys probably won\u2019t want to wear a shirt, it gets hot when they workout, and they usually go out to play ball after and Andy has always joined them.\n\nHope I did not insult anyone, if so, please lead me to sources so I may educate myself.

I only talked to a limited selection of people, and I didn't contact my friends who I know in real life. There was not any particular reason for this, I just found myself contacting them less and less as it would get deeper in summer. With MOST of my friends who I know in real life, I am able to talk to them every once in a while, and we are able to talk again like normal, no matter the time that passed by. So, I guess I must have assumed I was able to do that with all my friends. \n\nWhen we came back to in person school this year, I found it significantly harder to converse with one of my friends, and I could not pinpoint why. \n\nBut, one day, my friend asked if she could talk with me. I said yes, and she proceeded to tell me this.\n\nDuring the summer, there were times where she needed to talk to me, and would reach out, but I wouldn't reply. After this started happening more and more, she began to wonder if I had ghosted her.\n\nIt only got worse from there, because on the last half of July, I got my phone taken from me. So, it would be even harder to contact with my friends. I didn't bother to tell them, because at the time I didn't think they would text me all that much anyway. If they did, I figured I could just let them know on Instagram. Apparently, during that time, my friend had tried to text me, and when the message wouldn't go through, she assumed I had blocked her. When she was telling me this, I explained that I had never blocked her, and told her about how my phone was shut off. She proceeded to tell me that she didn't need to know all of that.\n\nAside from that, she also told me that she felt I wasn't putting effort in our relationship, and she wondered if she was wasting her time on me. Because of that, at school for the past few days, I tried extra hard to make conversation with her, but it didn't feel like she was reciprocating it at all, so I just gave it up. I figured if she doesn't want to talk with me, then I won't force her to.\n\nAnother thing, one day when we were talking before she decided to be honest with me, I was joking around and saying that I wanted to transfer to my cousins school. When she brought this up, she explained how she felt dismissed, and as if she was just a school friend, and not someone I would talk with outside of school. The thing is, I didn't know how to reply to that, because there is a possibility I might transfer to my cousins school. I didn't feel it was the right time to tell her about that, so I told her that I didn't know what to say, and that I couldn't verbalize my thoughts and feelings. When I said that, she said that if I have nothing to say, then I have nothing to say.\n\nNow, I'm wondering if she even wants to be my friend anymore, because I am willing to change my ways, but she is not reciprocating my attempts. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "verdict": "No A-holes here", "score": 1.0, "created": 1632040469.0, "author_fullname": "lilah_heartsu", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pr46d3/aita_for_not_talking_to_my_friend_the_whole_summer/"}, {"title": "AITAH for not suggesting my wife not go to her brothers wedding.", "content": "My wife and I live in England with our two young children.

In my view of our relationship we were progressing steadily, discussing marriage, even very close to engagement. We were sending each other ring designs, locations and discussing how we would do it. We had plans to get engaged in July or August.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing back to June and she approaches me whilst I'm in bed one morning and said, \"I'm thinking of moving out.\" In fact she wasn't thinking, she had already organised it. She packed her things and was gone within 24 hours. What I then discovered after was that she was at work organising moving out at exactly the same time that she had been coming home to me to discuss our future and our engagement plans. We had been looking at rings only 3 days before she left. She had been in discussions with a work colleague for weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter some very small back and forth and her not contacting me for 3 days. I attempted to get her to talk to me and she broke up with me over a text.

She essentially had been coming home and feigning love and leading me on. She then began jumping into dating sites just over a week later and kept justifying it because she felt this way for a long time. I had been cheated on in my previous relationship and this stung me big time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today. I discover my sister (34F) has been going out on breakfast dates with my ex and my parents even called her to wish her well on her birthday.

It's a very stupid issue, but I wanted your opinion on the matter please :)\n\nBackground : \n\nmy boyfriend and I have lived together for the past 2 years. We try to share chores and cooking 50-50, but I usually end up with 60-40, even if I'm a full time student and he is working less tjan 3h/day at home. When a new dish comes up, he prefers letting me do it, as he doesn't feel confident with new dishes. \n\nThe incident : \n\n2 days ago, I tried a \"new\" cake. I bought all the ingredients, prepared everything, and put it in the oven. I set a timer for 30mn, and while waiting, my nanny called. When the timer rang, I checked the cake by putting a knife and looking at the blade : the cake wasn't ready. I put another 5mn. The second time, I put the knife 3 times, and decided the cake was ready. I asked my boyfriend to take it out of the oven, as I don't have a good grip, and I was still on the phone. He got it out, and I resumed chatting, my back to the oven. 5mn later, I turned my head and... turns out the cake was back in the oven ! \n\nI got angry at him, asking why he would do this in my back, without asking, and he told me \"you are on the phone\". But I don't mind stopping 2mn. I was sour and told him now he overcooked the cake (he likes it dry, I like it soft). He answered angrily \"the knife was full of batter. You should thank me for doing what was necessary instead of having a crisis !\"\n\nI first refused to eat the cake because I felt hurt. The next morning, I decided to take a small piece while he was sleeping, thinking I may be making a  moutain out of nothing, and I would apologise if the cake was good. But no, it's overcooked. As a result, I talk without my usual \"warmth\" so it makes me quite dry. He isn't talking to me, only 1-2 words answers when I ask him something.\n\nWhy it's bothering me so much :\n\nI'm lacking self-confidence a lot, and one thing I love is cooking/baking. But he has a tendency to go behind my back to change the settings of the stove, remove something he considers \"cooked\", even if he didn't want to cook it in the first place. We talked about it this morning (it was very tense, with me quite agressive and him ignoring me), and he showed no remorse whatsoever. He told me \"next time I'll let you do 100%\" but to get rid of me, not because he felt sorry for hurting my feelings. In his mind, it's still me being a b* for nothing when he \"did what was necessary\". We have friends coming today, and when I asked if he was going to do his part of the chores, he told me \"IDK\" and now he's laying on the sofa, ignoring me.\n\nWhy I might be TA :\n\nI know I can be quite agressive when I'm hurt, and I haven't been talking as kindly as usual, just dry and cold. I wonder if I shoulf have just let it go and eaten the overcooked cake, because in the end it's just a cake, but...

Especially in groups of three it's easy for one person to feel excluded and we don't want that.\n\nNow on to the story. One of my friends, \"Anna\", has been in a relationship for about two years now, so Beth and I also hang out with Anna's boyfriend when we go to see Anna. Anna's boyfriend is absolutely awful. I won't go into detail because of the word limit but in short, Anna's boyfriend is super homophobic, sexist and he only spends his paycheck on alcohol and cigarettes while hanging out with his friends and refusing to help Anna with household chores or rent.\n\nAnna often comes to me to tell me about her relationship problems, I'm kind of the \"mom of the group\" character.

However, we didn't tell Anna and her boyfriend about our plans so I just showed up uninvited and without their knowledge. They seemed surprised but didn't say anything.\n\nBeth and my guess is that Anna told her boyfriend about her frequent talks with me about their relationship and now he wants her to cut me off.

My wife (f26) and I (29m) got married this past spring and due to covid we had a very small wedding with no bachelor/bachelorette parties.\n\nThis summer, my friend planned a bachelor party in Vegas and my wife thought it would be a good idea to plan a girls trip/mini bachelorette party/not sure exactly what, for the same weekend (already not the greatest idea in my mind).  However; my friends bachelor party fell through, and since I already booked the flights and hotel I decided I might as well still go and tag along with my wife's friends.  My wife said I could come, but I'm not a part of the trip and should do my own thing.  Sounded good to me, because I like Vegas and can definitely keep myself entertained.\n\nHere's the kicker, a few weeks before the Vegas trip, my wife finds out she's pregnant.  And coming up on the trip, she is feeling the signs of morning sickness.\n\nSo the Vegas trip comes around and I'm having fun gambling and doing random activities, when I remember marijuana is legalized in Vegas.  Back in college, I'll admit I was a pot smoking fiend, loved it so much and smoked almost daily.  Now being a bit older, married, and a kid on the way, I pretty much don't touch the stuff.  However, I thought what the heck, I'm in Vegas.  NOTE: I asked my wife's permission if it's ok if I smoke and she said yes.  So I went to this crazy dispensary, and like a kid in a candy shop, bought a bunch of stuff (flower, vapes, edibles, you name it).  Tbh my wife probably didn't think I'd go all out, but I did. And spend the rest of the trip wake and baking, and pretty much high all day all weekend.\n\nNow here's the final kicker.  The friends my wife invited are kind of lame and a few of them are broke.  Also none of them are mother's so they don't really understand pregnancy sickness.  So soon into the trip, my wife finds herself pretty miserable as her Vegas plans are falling through and she's feeling sick and nobody is really caring for her.  Everyone got into a big fight the day before we were leaving and my wife was telling off her friends and then I somehow got looped into it as being the worst offender.\n\nSo yeah, AITA here?  In hindsight there's a good chance I am, because my wife is pregnant and I should take care of her.

It\u2019s an easy surgery but it does cause gas pain and the standard swelling, bloating, pain and bleeding at the incision sites. The surgery was unexpected, and tomorrow one side of my husbands family is holding an engagement party, and the other side of his family is holding a wake for his great aunt. Because of the surgery there is no way I\u2019m going to be able to attend both. I can walk a bit, but riding in a car hurts, and I worry it will irritate my incisions and make them bleed (which has been happening if I walk too much).

I\u2019m totally okay with this. \n\nHe told me that he wanted me to go to the wake for his great aunt. I\u2019ve never met his great aunt, she lived out of state. I told him this was a little uncomfortable for me especially whereas everyone was going to be asking about why I\u2019m in a wheelchair and I have to explain a sad and uncomfortable situation in the midst of another sad and uncomfortable situation. I do feel sad for her passing, mostly because my FIL and GIL are hurt by it, but again, I didn\u2019t know her. And my husband isn\u2019t devastated by it. I did lightly explain this to him and told him that I would much rather go to the engagement party after a rough few weeks, but he told me he wants me to be there to support my family because they\u2019re my family now. which I understand, but I won\u2019t know most people at this wake. \n\nMy husband and I have been together for four years, we were long distance dating for two, moved in together, and a lil over year and a half of living together we got engaged. We decided to get married privately and hold our reception later. Because we were long distance, and I moved in with him during COVID, I haven\u2019t met his entire extended family (who will all be attending our wedding reception) I definitely want to meet them. His mother\u2019s side (the ones holding the engagement party) have two weddings coming up that we\u2019re invited to and I\u2019ve never even met the bride or groom for either.

My husband has been so incredibly supportive during this entire process. I\u2019ve been having issues with my tube for two weeks and he\u2019s been having to physically lift me out of bed, cook me all my meals, work from home, and he\u2019s gone completely above and beyond with caring for me.

He has two daughters and while he loves them, he has always treated them differently (aunt and uncle are my father's siblings). Where I'm from, you have to take an admission exam for the specific university and career you want to study. There are public and private universities, in the public ones you don't have to pay any tuition, while in the privates you pay according to your or your parents income and assets. \n\nA year ago, while I already started studying in a private university, I wanted to try getting admitted to a public one because I know for sure my parents won't be able to pay for my tuition long term (they're another long story). So I decided to try and sign in for the virtual admission exam (because lockdown) for a good public university. This one is known for being one of the best in our country for med school, and F has tried to get admitted for four years, but he couldn't and started studying in a private one. There were scandals about that exam (another long story), but even so I got admitted and I was really excited about it. \n\nI didn't tell everyone at once because we all supported my F and we know he had a rough time because of that. My relatives knew it because of phone calls and asking. While my aunt and uncle were happy for me, there were some comments when we called each other that made clear that they still were a bit touched about it and I understood. I didn't visit any of my relatives until one week before Christmas, and in that first time there were still some comments here and there, but it didn't bother me. D suddenly avoided them until we left. Later he said he heard them saying awful things about me, and didn't want to say what specifically. Since then, he went low contact with them. My parents are trying to make him talk more with my uncle since he is constantly asking about him, but he refuses. I knew they talked because of my cousin being a bit touched about it since he wanted to be the first one of the family admitted there, but since what D said it feels different.\n\nI'm not expecting an apology from them (that's a lot to ask to my father's family), but for them just to stop badmouthing and they don't seem to be stopping soon. My parents somehow understand me not seen my aunt, but want me to encourage D to talk with my uncle, he doesn't even want to see my aunt, but I refused to since it's his choice to side with me. I know my uncle can help him way more than my parents will ever be able to, emotionally and with his studies (not paying for his tuition, but with anything else related to it), but he still doesn't want to see him. I know that if I talk to D and remind him about our situation he will eventually accept and feel guilty about this, but I don't want to take part in his decision.

She told me that the new people in the dining area were Kate\u2019s (My uncles girlfriend) kids. They were late teens early twenty\u2019s. I then told my mother that I didn\u2019t care. Wether that be them being there, meeting them or anything to do with them. She then looked astounded and said \u201cdon\u2019t be so rude\u201d I told her I wasn\u2019t being rude I just didn\u2019t care.\n\nNow I should probably tell you guys why I felt like this and the short answer is my Uncle is a giant dickbag but i will give you the long answer. He pays rent to live downstairs but tells everyone else there not allowed to go down there but since he\u2019s a big hypocritical asshole he still gets to come upstairs whenever he wants. We also have a baby that lives upstairs and my Uncle and all his friends smoke weed with no doors shut which brings the smoke upstairs and everyone will talk to each over about how much they don\u2019t like it but won\u2019t do anything because they are scared of him. He also gets extremely angry when you make even the slightest noise anywhere between 7-8 AM which is fair but him and his friends will be yelling and laughing all through the night until 2AM most nights and they just don\u2019t care about anyone else. My Uncle also once brought a dog of one of his friends because his friend had no lawn for the dog but my Uncle will just hit the dog whenever it does something like pee on the concrete instead of the grass when he could just teach it not too. He also doesn\u2019t respect COVID restrictions such as not being able to invite people over but he thinks he\u2019s above despite his mother living with us and being in her late 60s. He will still call people who get covid dumbasses though.\n\nSo pretty much I\u2019m sick of this fuckers hypocritical bullshit and I\u2019m tired of everyone always talking about how they don\u2019t like him but then acting friendly towards him whenever he\u2019s around and that\u2019s why I said that I didn\u2019t care about Kate\u2019s kids. Of course after this my parents came to my room and told my I was grounded from all things for being rude.\nAITA?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631951884.0, "author_fullname": "krimemen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pqiaq5/aita_for_telling_my_uncles_girlfriends_kids_that/"}, {"title": "AITA for being honest with my girlfriend about smoking weed and then her dumping me?", "content": " Just for context, I'm m24 my ex is f24.\n\nSo it all started when I noticed I have this issue where I can\u2019t sleep at night. I tried every over the counter medication like melatonin but nothing helped. I work early in the morning so I was desperate for a solution. So this is where I thought maybe some weed can help, I used to be a stoner back in the day but I quit two years ago (I don't smoke or drink either). Now weed is super illegal where I\u2019m from but if you know people its easy to get. We are also Muslims so that doesn\u2019t help but most locals especially young ones are pretty chill about it. So I discuss all this with my ex and she was not happy. My ex was brought up in a strict Muslim family so weed is very scary to her. We went back and forth until she finally agreed I could try it once or twice to see if it helps.\n\nThen this happens...\n\nA few days after our discussion I got some weed and smoked a little before bed. It helped, I started sleeping again. So five days ago I decided to tell her about it. She got mad, we argued, then we decided it's better if I stop and I agreed. I believe there are better ways I can deal with this issue and that I should get help.\n\nSo the next day she stops texting me. I knew it was over. This went on for four days until today I decided to call her. She tells me she can't be around people like me. I told her I have a problem, I need you to help me through this. If you really loved me you would be more understanding. I have stopped smoking since we talked five days ago. I started eating healthy and working out consistently, I feel good. But no...She doesn't want to be in this \"criminal world\", she thinks I'm a junkie. Smoking weed is so bad that it's an unforgivable sin.

My dad was in the vicinity but I didn't ask him directly since I had been having a conversation with my mom at the time. Over the next few days I mentioned shelters, pet insurance, talked to my sister about how to integrate a new cat with my sister's cat (who we've had for ~10yrs). My dad was often in the room and never said anything. \n\nA week after I got a cat, she started scratching on a certain rug and my mom said not to let her do that. I was confused because we've all seen my sister's cat use her claws on that rug. My dad then snapped at me that I'm suppose to be training my cat and teaching her not to do certain things. I said nothing but stopped her from scratching the rug. \n\nLater when my parents thought I was out of earshot my dad said he never gave me permission to get a cat and asked my mom if she did. She said no. Later I asked her about this and she said she just hadn't expected me to get a cat so soon. I also asked her about the rug, and she explained how my sister's cat uses her claws differently (not really scratching the rug). I understood apologized, and said I appreciated her communicating with me and that I just need them to tell me nicely when my cat does something they don't want her to, since otherwise I might not know it's off limits. \n\nTonight, my cat started playing with some blinds. My dad saw before me, ridiculed her and told me not to let her do that. I countered by saying she wasn't using her claws. He said it doesn't matter because she'll use her claws eventually. I stopped her from playing with them and said \"OK, now that you've told me, I won't let her do it again\". I thought that was that, but a minute later my dad came back into the room and snapped at me again that I'm suppose to be training her and I need to pay if she damages anything (which I already knew, since I pay for her care and she is my responsibility). I was very shaken by his tone and asked if he could please trust me to know her behavior. He said no. I apologized again as he walked away. \n\nI feel like I am TA because I never asked my dad directly if I could get a cat, and because I shouldn't have gotten defensive when he said not to let her play with the blinds. But I don't know what to do without being even more of an AH because if I keep the cat then I'm afraid she'll do something naughty again that I won't see before my dad, especially if she actually damages something.

The move was a bit of a stretch since I'd been on a variable income for a while before the move to the point that I had to ask my grandma to help. However, I didn't have much choice in the move because I finally was able to find a full-time job and the commute from my previous place wasn't a viable option. My new apartment is in a kid-friendly neighbourhood.\n\nOne of the things that NEEDED replacement were literally all the curtains (4 rooms). The previous inhabitants somehow had managed to ruin all the curtains. As you may know curtains are expensive. I replaced the curtains in my bedroom/living room as soon as I could because the other doors can be kept shut so I'd still have my privacy. I replaced the other pair a few weeks ago, but I still have one room where the curtains need replacing. \n\nIn this room the curtains are too small. There's a gap of about 10 cm in between the curtains even when they're all the way shut. In this room I do my laundry, meaning that sometimes I'll go in there naked when I've just done the laundry and not put the dry underwear back in my closet yet.\n\nWhen I walk in, I just grab what I need and go back out. Didn't really think twice about it since I don't expect people to peek through the gap, especially since there's grass for about 5 meters beyond my window and bushes right in front of them. \n\nHowever, last week one of the neighbours knocked on my door and complained about it. She said that it was not okay to be nude where kids could see me. It's a small effort to grab a towel to cover myself so I can grab my underwear, so I told her it'd been a mistake and that it won't happen again. \n\nI thought that was that. Up until this last morning. The day before yesterday I did my laundry so that morning my laundry was hanging in the laundry room. I DID NOT ENTER NAKED. Remembering the convo, I'd grabbed a clean pair of underwear that were mostly dry and hung it over the heater in the hallway (not visible from outside since I had the door closed) to dry the rest of the way. \n\nSo I was rather surprised when the same neighbour knocked on my door again to complain about my laundry. I told her that I wasn't planning on stopping doing my laundry there but that I would make sure the kids don't see me. I explained that I'm planning to just grab my underwear the day before and have one pair dry somewhere else so it wouldn't happen. She told me that I can always forget that and that it's not enough. I said something along the lines of \"Sorry, but that's the best I can do\". She left then but this morning I saw a flyer in my mailbox about the 'importance of good obstructions of view from the street'.\n\nI think I might be the AH because- well, obviously it's not okay if a kid saw me.

The meaning there was \"a stupid person\". I still didn't understand what she was tryna insinuate but I told her that wasn't what I meant. I showed the slang meaning but she kept insisting I insulted her. I asked how I was insulting her. All she said was \"never mind\" and she kept sulking over it. She kept saying I was defending myself instead of apologizing. And I'm like \"what are you talking about? I've told you what I meant. Did that offend you?\"\n\nShe really made a big issue over this. So I left a message for her telling her how she ruined my mood and how she's not giving any tangible reason for why she feels insulted. Honestly I feel ashamed that we're legit quarrelling over something this petty. She called this morning and I didn't pick to be honest. She then messaged me and began throwing tantrums again. I couldn't take it anymore so I told her in a voice notes that she was being senseless. I mean I was so frustrated!! How can someone act like a word has just one meaning? Stubbornly refusing to listen to me. So I lost my cool and I'm not proud of that. But she headed to her status to say \"Before dating someone, check their mental health. Moving on. Bye for life\". And she's obviously blocked me as well.\n\nI was shocked. I've tried calling her countless times. She's not picking. I've also sent her an SMS. No reply as well. She's giving me heartbreak right now honestly.\n\nAita?\n\nBtw if me and my gf don't communicate again, I guess I won't be dating till I'm done with school. I'm already feeling so sick \ud83d\ude2d.

I know I can be over the top with my anxiety and jealousy sometimes and I try my best to communicate why I react the way I do or say what I do. For a few months now he goes to speech therapy and he told me about having a really young therapist and since then he always jokes about her being so young and yada yada. I mostly joke along or get sarcastic, since talking to him about it making me uncomfortable didn't really change anything. Also it's important to say that we can't see each other that often, so I try to use every time we can as good as possible. A few weeks ago I took the chance to visit him and stay over night. He told me he had therapy the next day, which was fine by me. Next day came, he goes to therapy and I wait for him. And I wait. And after 15 minutes after the session should have ended I texted to ask where he was and if everything is alright (therapy is a 2 minutes walk away). I ask him to more times with out an answer and after another 25 minutes I walk over to the therapy and call him. He answers really nervous and tells me \"what? I'm at the grocery store (next to therapy). I eh, yeah I eh I met a colleague from work.\"\nThat was 10 minutes after I waited there so I know he was not in the store and no colleague lives even close to where he lives, so probably not the case. I tell him I know he's not at the store and to get out immediately. He comes out of the therapy place and is confused about why I am mad at him and doesn't understand why lying was such a big thing and he was just chatting with her after the session. Of course we have a big fight and everything and he kind of apologises. We still had some problems and fights over this bc he thinks I'm overreacting and I'm mad bc he just doesn't not understand what my problem is with his actions. Since then I ask him when he has therapy so I know when he will come out of the session (I know, kinda controlling, but I just wanna know for my own sanity really and I never said anything about it nor did I go crazy over something). He now asks me why I'm asking about it and why I try to control him and he's mad and making me the bad person.

Last night, we got into a pretty big argument initiated by her asking me permission to go meet some of her friends. The location was a 25 minute drive which concerned me. She kept insisting though and so I relented and said that I would allow it if they changed the location to somewhere closer. This seemed to satisfy her but while she was texting her friend about changing the location, I made a comment about how parties like this is the stuff is focusing on now instead of her studies. \n\nMy comment made her mad and she said that it doesn't have to be that deep and she can do both of things. I brought up her terrible grades from last year which were a clear indication of how she COULDN'T do both and told her that it was obviously her phone causing this, the phone she uses to text her friends. She proceeded to yell at me about how I keep blaming the phone for all her problems when the problem is in fact, me. \n\nBut she was a good kid till 8th grade. The issues arose when she switched schools in 9th. Because school was online, for my daughter, who has always been extremely quiet, making friends online was easier. So now she had friends she could talk to. And her screen time rose and grades fell. I brought this up and mentioned that it was obvious that her friends were just trying to turn her against me. \n\nShe told me that the reason she was on her phone an extreme amount in 9th grade was because she was struggling to keep up with the more difficult curriculum of her new school because of attention problems and so used her phone as a distraction and in 8th grade, she had the same issues which were just easily concealed due to the relatively easier curriculum so it was my fault for not noticing and that she HAS been trying more in 10th grade, no thanks to me though. But aren't her attention problems also clearly caused by her phone? \n\nAnd then she said that her friends can manage their studies while also using their phones and having social lives and being overall happier than her so I should see that the problem isn't the phone or having friends. Which I suppose is true. My daughter generally always seems miserable, isolates herself from her family and neglects her health. But she has all her needs taken care of so what could the problem be besides her phone? \n\nBringing back the issue to her little party, I criticized her for making such a big deal about this but she said it wasn't about that anymore, it was about 'everything'. But I told her if she really wanted to go she should have her mom talk to the other kids' parents first but she just rolled her eyes and said she didn't want to go anymore because I had 'ruined it'. \nIs this just a teenager being dramatic and over emotional or AITA and if yes, then how am I supposed to fix this?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631863441.0, "author_fullname": "confused_dad2948", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ppvhxu/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_hang_out/"}, {"title": "AITA for wearing scrub caps", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631863718.0, "author_fullname": "Yeet_my_feets", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ppvjto/aita_for_wearing_scrub_caps/"}, {"title": "AITA for being the classic insecure bully in highschool", "content": "I became really good friends with this kid in my freshman year of high school.

He has bipolar disorder and severe anger issues. It was a toxic relationship. Throughout that year-long relationship I was also snapping at him and saying cruel things in retaliation. I left for both our sakes.\n\nA week after our breakup I found out he had begun flirting with other women and I called him out on it. Cue fighting, insults, etc. and we left it at that. A little while after that we decided to try just being friends - stupid, I know, but I had been struggling to move on. I had been lonely and missing him. And I figured, it shouldn't matter if he's messing around with random chicks, since we're not together anymore.\n\nHe opened up to me about his depression, how it's gotten to the point where he's lost 20-30 pounds. I talked through it with him and did my best to comfort him.\n\nI'd been going through things as well. I had walked to the train station, a whole hour walk because of lack of a car, with the intention of jumping in front of a train. I told him about this and he gave me a one word response: \"oh\". He proceeded to tell me that my life was fine and he doesn't know what my problem is, nor what he can do to help me.\n\nI stopped talking to him. No contact for a week, until he tells me he got fired from his job for calling in too much. I chatted with him a bit about it, just to gauge his mental about the whole thing, since I remember how he brought up his depression. He just seemed to shrug it off so I stopped contact again.\n\nThat was on Monday. Today, he messages me asking for a favour. He has 0 savings and needs a loan to pay this month's rent (iirc $800/month), promising to pay me back by November latest. His parents can't help him as they're not financially stable. He has no other family near him, he has just filed for unemployment, he has no friends or siblings that can help him.\n\nI told him no. I told him to negotiate with his roommate to sort this out. He tried to call me a shitty person, because he might become homeless and there's \"no downside\" to me since I have a fair bit of savings.\n\nI've lent him money in the past but that was back when we were together and so he paid me back. Now? I don't know.\n\nHonestly majority of the reason I said no isn't even because I don't trust him, I just don't think it's my obligation to help him.

Of course my mum said \u201eyou know, things like that wouldn\u2019t happen, if you weren\u2019t so fat!\u201c I got angry and hurt and said back to her \u201ecause skinny people never get injuries or what?!?\u201c \n\nA day later she told me this funny story, about how she went shopping with my sister and two nephews and how the older one (2) kept pushing his kiddy trolley over my sister\u2019s feet and into her heals and how they now hurt, so I looked her straight in the eyes and said \u201emaybe you should tell sister to lose weight. Then such things wouldn\u2019t happen to her\u201c. She looked dumbfounded and stared at me, realising what I just did. Then she stormed off and was cold to me for a while.\n\nTo clarify, I love my sister, she herself never treated me bad and even often defends me against my parents.

His apartment is very small. He has family coming to stay this month which means that there is not enough space in the apartment for her to stay there. I (27f) agreed to let her stay with me and my fianc\u00e9 (27m) for 2 weeks while she has nowhere else. The dates and the reason then changed (the bf will be out of town for 2 weeks). But she still says she needs to stay for 2 weeks. The period where she wants to stay is not ideal for us. I won't be in town for half of it and my fianc\u00e9 will also be away with me for one of the weekends. We're not super comfortable leaving her in our apartment on our own and living with her for 2 weeks would probably be quite uncomfortable as she is quite disorganised and talkative whereas we are quite strict about our schedule and my fianc\u00e9 is quite introverted, but we decided we would make it work as she has no other option.\n\nWe met up with her and her bf in the evening before she came to stay with us. As we were leaving I wished the bf a good trip and he said it wouldn't be for any time soon. When we got back I asked her about this. She said that the trip had been cancelled but that she was glad she was staying at ours as he lives in a rough area and someone was killed near her apartment recently.\n\nThe next morning we told her that we weren't comfortable having her to stay anymore, especially while we weren't there (we were fine with her staying the extra day until that w-e). I agreed to let her stay because she had nowhere else to go, not to let her move in with us rent-free while she gets organised enough and collects enough money to be able to find a new apartment. I also wasn't happy that she didn't tell us that her bf's trip had been cancelled.\n\nHer point of view is that she told me about the cancelled trip as soon as she knew (maybe she found out that day but I had to ask to actually find out) and that she's completely paranoid living with her bf due to the rough area (her bf has spent the last month trying to get her to be careful and realise it's a rough area, but it only sunk in after the recent crime). She doesn't seem to see why the reason why she's staying changes the situation and thinks I'm just making her life harder.\n\nI think this is made more complicated by our differing personalities. She makes friends very easily and has previously described me as her best friend in the city. When she arrived at ours she said she's so grateful that I'm looking out for her and that I'm like her surrogate mother in the city. I'm not hugely comfortable with this. We met shortly before covid and have only met up a few times since (maybe 10-20) so I don't see her as a close friend and I didn't sign up to have to mother someone older than me.\n\nAm I the asshole for completely changing my mind about having her to stay after she had already arrived?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631867314.0, "author_fullname": "Infamous_Candy_2832", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ppw8ah/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out/"}, {"title": "AITA my gf saw her ex, when asked she denied it, but then admitted she did.", "content": "A few weeks ago my gf phone was on the side of the bed with her phone log left up, I instantly saw her Ex\u2019s name, I asked her and she said no, even though I was convinced it was.

He started 7th grade after one year of homeschooling (due to the pandemic). Last week I checked his grades and saw he got 50% on a science quiz. I asked him to review material before he retakes it. He said his teacher makes them leave notebooks in class. (There are no text books, everything is done on chromebook or worksheets.) I was a bit annoyed that they are being tested on stuff they only see for an hour at a time and can't review, so I email teacher a firm note saying kid is dyslexic and entitled to bring notes home. I bcc the VP. The VP replies that yes, kid is allowed to bring home notes, and gets extra time AND that she will review 504 policy with all teachers again. Teacher replies that Kids are always welcome to take home notes (basically calling my kid a liar). I am annoyed but life goes on. \n\nThe next week kid had an excuse absence. He went up to a different teacher to ask what he had missed in class. Mr. Jerkface said to \"go ask a classmate.\" My kid is shy and didn't have friends in the class to ask so came home not knowing what he missed. A video? A lecture? An activity? No idea. I was upset so I emailed the teacher and dryly asked for missing assignments. I then emailed VP and let her know exactly what the teacher had said and that it was a violation of 504 accommodations and that he was extremely unprofessional as it is not the responsibility of another 12 year old to supply my kid with missing info.\n\nI got no replies at all from anyone. The next time my kid has this teacher, Mr. Jerkface hands him a packet and says \"all you had to do was ask your group, all right?\" My kid says he used a disappointed tone. (The packet was 6 pages, front and back, small type, and a worksheet to fill out with info from pages. Also kid says that with activities like this in the past the teacher would hand out papers then play an accompanying video and even pause when class should take notes. I am guessing video was a link he could easily email but didn't. So my kid probably didn't get all the teaching materials he missed). \n\nSo we find ourselves in a situation where we get this packet on Thursday and might have a quiz on it the next day, we don't know. We want to drop the matter to avoid any retaliation from Mr. Jerkface. But I am also tempted to email the VP again just to document his behaviour. \n\nI want to know if I'm the asshole for possibly overreacting to this horrible teacher. He could have just given my kid the papers when first asked. Or he could have said he would get the work the next day, or that it was a group project he could maker up later, literally anything other than what he said would have probably been fine.

A convoluted approach, I understand, but I said something along the lines of \u2018I think (said friend who identifies as bisexual) swings more on the gay side so I think it\u2019s ok for physical touch\u2019. Of course this isn\u2019t the true reason; as mentioned before, the true reason was that I hadn\u2019t experienced any other weird experiences with physical contact with anyone else in the group. I am honestly trying to educate myself and be more aware because I felt terrible being ignorant as to how this comment is screwed up and hurt my friend\u2019s feelings. My thought process behind the comment was simply due to not seeing said bisexual friend not interested or pursuing anyone of the female gender. The way my friend found out was through said acquaintance telling the person I was uncomfortable with who told him. If someone could please explain or help me understand I would be more than happy to listen, because I never intended to hurt my friend and I now feel terrible.", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631872283.0, "author_fullname": "PoolSpecialist", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ppx4xr/aita_for_accidental_biphobic_comment/"}, {"title": "AITA for pissing off my HOA by making an ugly fence to stop a creeper?", "content": "2 weeks ago, someone saw my next door neighbor using binoculars to look into another neighbor's window.

Second child maternity leaves (39M/37F). Country with high equality and the father also goes on parental leave for a period of time. Also, sharing of household chores is expected.\n\nIt's my turn to go on paternity leave, and it's very different than when she was on her parental leave. (To be clear, I am comparing the latter period of her parental leave)\n\nDuring her parental leave (when I work), she put up very hard-to-meet requirements and expectations. This included\n\n* Availability to 9 am and from 17 am. If work requires extra time, I can do that when both kids are asleep. \n* Take kids during mornings to provide long sleep for her every second day\n* No personal time for exercise or well-being\n* No relaxing before both kids are asleep. Do chores.\n* No money to the shared economy. (Note, we get money from state and employer during this period, around eighty percent of salary)\n\nThere are a lot of rules and expectations that I'm not writing here, you get the point - it's hard to reach.\u00a0Expectations are reasonable, it's just a question about how to live our life, and what is important to her.\n\nNow, I'm the type of guy that says 'if this is important to you, I'll do it, but I'll hold you to the same standards, are you sure about this'? She happily added new requirements, and now it's my turn to go on parental leave.\n\nSuffice to say, she doesn't uphold her requirements. She leaves early, comes home late, and doesn't help with chores during weekdays. Now I knew this would happen, and I've been annoyed with it since long before I started my parental leave, thats also why I might be the Asshole. But that's also why I've asked her so many times, during her parental leave, if she's sure about the requirements/expectations.\u00a0 \n\nShe claims she does not remember putting many of these requirements on me, even if we discussed them at the time thoroughly. Also she claims I sometimes did not deliver on the expectations and that my memory is skewed. She also claims her work is not as free with working from home, and her colleagues does not have kids, and she doesn't want to stick out. In our country, it is still lockdown, and not recommended to go to the office.\n\nNow I'm annoyed every day she doesn't uphold her own expectations. It is infected. I recognize all of her opinions, it's just aggrevating that I should not be able to hold her to the same standards as she held me. I find it difficult to just 'let it go', since i've lived like this for a year.\n\nIn addition, during the year of her paternity leave, she didn't spend any time on maintenance tasks (she rarely does). Our house is falling into disrepair, and now during my parental leave I have to pick up the slack when the kid sleeps. We talked about this yesterday and she started crying when I asked her to mention a single task she did.

My niece and I are only three months apart in age and we're more like sisters. We decided to buy a house together. Her boyfriend and father of her youngest child, an 8 month old and I are the ones on the mortgage because my credit was great, hers was crap and her boyfriends was nonexistant. He had the income though. We agreed before even looking at houses and multiple times after that we would divide the mortgage and bills three ways. Three adults into thirds. For context, she has an 18 yo boy, 16 yo girl and an 8 month old baby. So technically 5 of them and I have a 12 yo boy. 2 of us. Fast forward to today. I have recently gotten a job where we moved. It is part time but I make 30 hours or so at a little over minimum wage. Her boyfriend transferred and is making good money as a manager at a company making overtime each week. She came to me and told me he never agreed to us paying thirds and wants me to pay half the bills including the mortgage. As a single mom with a part time job I never would have gone into this with that agreement. I will barely be scraping by while they live comfortably. This is all about him wanting more spending money above his addictions. He spends half his money on cigarettes, energy drinks and weed. Not to mention he pays for child support for a child he doesn't see. They have been arguing about money a lot lately. Now that they know I am starting to have a paycheck come in, they are trying to take it all away. I didn't want to struggle. I stressed that when looking at houses. I didn't want to buy a house that would require struggle. I wanted to live comfortably. Which is what it would have been if we all payed thirds as agreed. AITA for feeling like they brokemy trust and angry that they are being so selfish and greedy? I would have had no problem kicking in more money as able and needed.

I (nonbinary 22) my husband (M25) purchased a house and moved in 2 weeks ago.

She said she was hungry and thirsty and so me and my husband left to get her something to eat and drink and when we came back she was gone. The next morning on the 3rd day we went out shopping, and as we were pulling into our driveway we caught the tweaker on our property going through our shed. She opened a lot our belongings, set off our leftover fireworks, and hid our ladder. \n\nWe asked her repeatedly why she was on our property/stealing our stuff, which she would not give us an explanation for. Eventually she fed us some bullshit that apparently the cops told her to do it and that they'd be meeting her at our property to haul away our stuff. She also went off on a tangent how she talks to trucks and birds, and that the neighbors truck belonged to her specifically because it was red. She also said something creepy along the lines of, \"It must be nice having nice things.\" \n\nI went into the house while my husband stayed outside and I called the cops. The cops arrived and wrote up a report but said they couldn't arrest or remove her from our property. They could only ask her to leave. We went out and bought security cameras and No Trespassing signs and installed them. \n\n5th day- I caught the tweaker trying to look into our windows. 6th day- she had used our outside water faucet. 7th day- she rooted through our trash can. 8th day- our neighbors across the street called the cops on her, and again, the cops refused to arrest or remove her from the neighbor's property. \n\n9th day- we found a pair of panties in our backyard. 10th-12th day- we didn't see her around. 13th day- we found a sleeping bag stuffed with her clothes hidden behind our other shed in our backyard. I called the police for the 4th time at this point demanding that they do something about her already and all they did was take her clothes and cite her for trespassing. Said they couldn't arrest her or remove her from the property. \n\nDidn't see her on the 14th day. Today is the 15th day and she used our outside water again (we tried finding the shut off valve in our basement to cut off water to the faucet, so we got fed up and removed the knob from it entirely so that no one can turn it on again).

When I said we romanticize the war he starts yelling at me about my \u201cliberal\u201d edu.). My dads racism has come out more.

Idk why I decided to stand my ground for once but when my dad said \u201cdon\u2019t worry it\u2019s not the China virus\u201d I responded \u201cCOVID is world wide. We could call it the Italy or even US virus at this point. Can you please not call it the China virus during dinner?\u201d \n\nHe doubled down and started on about it being his right to call it that and that is what it is, so I said \u201cif you can\u2019t not call it that for one simple hour, I can leave\u201d then after a short pause I said \u201cbut I want to talk this out\u201d. \n\nHe again doubled down about his rights and I got a little heated bc this is the first time I\u2019ve stood up for myself about anything remotely political (other than the civil war incident 3 years ago) and I asked him \u201cwhy can\u2019t you respect me enough right now to just not say something that bothers me for the time it\u2019ll take us to eat?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou need to respect I have the right to say whatever I want. I\u2019m your father\u201d. \n\nI asked my question again and he told me to leave. When I tried to keep talking it through he got up and walked out.

Basically without boring you with details of the fight, they both went on a rant on each other.\n\nMy girlfriend was in shock and was looking at me all embarrassed while all of this is going on and asked me why I don't intervene so they can stop fighting In front of so many people.

I lost my job for missing work caring for my mom. After I worked at a home health agency that paid me to take care of my mom but earned a fraction of prior income. Huge blow financially. What choice did I have? It was my mother. How could I not take care of her? I have an older sister. Since mom died she only cares about what she can get from mom\u2019s estate which isn\u2019t much. She lived on fixed income. My mom had her house, car and personal property. Mom had a small life insurance policy which she left to me so that I could pay off her debt and settle her estate since I\u2019m executor.

When mom was alive, I asked my sister twice if she could come see her and help out to give me a break and help with mom\u2019s bills. Each time was only for a couple hundred dollars. I thought it fair to split responsibility. Each time said she would ask her husband about the money but couldn\u2019t come because she didn\u2019t have vacation time. She told me to \u201cstick her in a nursing home\u201d. She blew me off about the money and didn\u2019t hear from her for couple of months. When I did talk to her again, she would tell me about vacations they went on. She could do that but not help with our mom. She hadn\u2019t talked to my mom 4 months prior to her death. Didn\u2019t even call after she got home from the hospital 2 weeks prior to her death. Sister expects me to split the remainder of the life insurance policy with her after estate is settled. At first, I was going to because I thought it fair. Now I don\u2019t want to. I sacrificed my life, time, savings and income to care for my mother. Not complaining because I loved my mom. My sister wouldn\u2019t do sh*t to help us. Plus, when my sister was going through my mom\u2019s house for what she wanted to keep, she took 8k of personal property. I took 1 box of stuff. When she had to inventory what she took, lied about it so she wouldn\u2019t be forced to take a smaller cut of the cash in the estate. Mom\u2019s will is a 50/50 split.

He is not named in mom\u2019s will. He has NO say in anything. It\u2019s all about the greed. Would I be TAH if I didn\u2019t give her 50% of the remaining life insurance?

My other friend and I didn\u2019t want to do it. She tried to convince us to do it with us but we were still not going to do it.  So then she broke down and told us that we never support her and she was going to do it alone. The thing is that last time she asked me to do a competition with her, I told her yes even though I didn\u2019t want to do it. So I got mad that she would say something like, even if I don\u2019t do the trail doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t support her. When she told us that, my other friend told her that finally she was going to do it. While I told her \u201calright you can do it alone\u201d. Ever since I told her that she hasn\u2019t talked to me.

She fulfils mostly every parental responsibility and has basically been a single mother to me since I was 4. I see my dad for two 15 minute intervals a day when he takes me to and from school - in this time we catch up and talk about our day. When i was younger, 5-10, i would stay with my dad during the day in summer while my mom worked. He would often not be around, and I would be left for long periods of time usually 8 hours. \n\n\nNow that I\u2019m 16 my dad thinks I should take the bus to school and go myself.

I verbalised how I felt that this was just him trying to remove me from his life, and that this is the only thing he does for me as a dad and he hit the roof.

He often throws out \u201cstaying at his flat\u201d because he knows I would never agree to that offer. This is because his flat reminds me of a lot of bad memories of when I would be left alone there as a kid. As well as this I feel really uncomfortable staying there because when I sleep his friends will often uninvited come into the flat and bedroom where im sleeping and watch me. To this my dad thinks I\u2019m being overdramatic and targeting his friends. I don\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t see why I\u2019d be uncomfortable. One of his friends lives in the flat next door and my dad never locks the connecting door which also makes me feel scared. \n\nI don\u2019t want to *not* take the bus but also I don\u2019t want my time with my father to be severed.

I don't trust this man for anything. He has a very very high criminal record as well as an extremely long history of cheating. Back in 2018, when I caught him with another girl in my mom's room, he actually got so upset I caught him that he broke into our house and trashed EVERYTHING from the TV to my mattress. I have absolutely zero tolerance for him, yet it's an on and off fling in mom's eyes. One day she's done with him, the next they're dating casually, I give up on what she thinks of him.\n\nSo here's the situation. A few days ago, he calls mom and I asking if he could come over and nap at our place. Apparently the neighbors were being extremely loud, our house is quiet, etc. Remember this detail: He said he was coming ALONE. So of course mom says it's ok since they're dating, but I'm on edge, I don't trust him in our house. I lock my door to my room, grab my phone and my pepper spray, I wait. His truck pulls up, the door opens, it gets eerily quiet. Also for context, we have 2 dogs at our house. Apparently he just let the dogs outside, no using our leashes, nothing. So when I saw one of our dogs in the neighbor's yard from my window, I immediately ran out and brought them back. I put them in their kennels because I was terrified of them running off again. \n\nAfter my moment of panic, I noticed something odd. I heard mom's guy friend's voice in her bedroom. Yet there was someone else in the bathroom. Taking a shower. Using my towel and loofah and soap I kept on my bathroom shelf. Too. Many. Red. Flags. When confronted about who she was, he couldn't keep his story straight. He told me she was his cousin, he told mom she was his sister. All I knew is he said he was coming ALONE to nap. Instead I see some strange lady I've never seen nor heard of using MY soap, MY towel, MY loofah, all of MY hygienic stuff. Just thinking about it makes me want to shower again, I don't want some disease ridden stranger using my shower supplies when I don't even know their name.\n\nTime passes. A few days later while I'm at work, mom invites him over again. This time, he did come alone. Yet when I got home, I found my dinner and most of my food that I bought suddenly gone. Mom said he ate it and he'll \"pay me back later\". He never does. I lost my mind. It would be one thing if I gave him permission to eat my food, but to have a stranger use my shower products and then to come in and eat my meals without my permission? I cussed him out. He just slammed the doors to my house and drove off.\n\nMom is now upset that I made him slam the door and made him angry. I told her if he was honest and didn't use my stuff without my permission, I wouldn't cuss him out.

We're really happy and excited about the wedding and we're already planning as early as now.\n\nThe thing is, my father and I are not okay because of reasons I cannot state here. \n\nEventually, my dad and I had a confrontation about everything he did. But instead of apologizing, he just downplayed what he did and even said he's just 'sick'. My visits became lesser afterward until I moved to a different state. I rarely spoke to them from then on, and only relied on WhatsApp for communication.\n\nFast forward to 2021. Travis and I are engaged, living in a different state and far from my parents. Since they're still my family, I told them about the engagement via video call. My father said he already knows because Travis has asked for his approval before even proposing to me (which I found out was just out of decency because Travis hates my dad with a burning passion, but he didn't want to look like an asshole so he spoke to my dad anyways). My mother started pestering me about the wedding plans, then told my dad to make sure he looks his best 'for my big day' because he'll be walking me in the aisle in front of 'high profile people' (she's talking about my co-workers). I mindlessly blurted out 'no, you're not walking me, I'll walk alone'. He then proceeded to scream at me, saying how dare I defy the tradition and what will people think of him if he doesn't walk me.

Also on mobile so apologies.\n\nMy gf went to a camping music festival with three other friends (I couldn't go). We usually go to music festivals together with a larger group but due to covid and other things it was only the four. She had a free day beforehand so she was put in charge with groceries for the entire group, which was originally 6 people (two had to bail for medical reasons) and is a doozy of a task. Another friend was supplying the vehicle and driving. A third friend, let's call them Tom, was in charge of bringing the stove top for cooking.\n\nA few months before the fest, his storage unit was broken into. We had to lend him a tent last minute for a separate event because of it as his tent had gotten stolen (which he never thanked us for but just got angry when we said there might not be enough stakes). Yet he didn't check for his stove top until two nights before the fest, and yep, that was stolen too (despite him confirming he had it weeks before). With such little time to find another friend's they could borrow, Tom had to go buy a new stove top for the fest.\n\nPrior to the fest there were agreed upon shared expenses for the camping pass and groceries. (Sidenote: the $75 totem my girlfriend made she didn't ask to split.) My gf Venmo requested everyone to pay for grocery expenses.\n\nAnyways, Tom comes in a week after the fest and says he knows it wasn't talked about before but he feels it would be fair if everyone chipped in to pay for the camping stovetop (costs $100) and propane that he had to buy, asking for $20 from each person. My gf says no, since it's his stovetop. She's happy to pay for the fuel for it but the stovetop are now his to keep and that didn't seem fair. She said to me later that if she knew she would have to pay for it she could have driven way out of her way and used her dad's stovetop, or have sooner bought her own. He responded saying it was an \"essential item\" so he puts it in a different category than ie the totem (which he def made a big deal about using to find the group at the fest).\n\nHe doesn't pay for two weeks, and when he does it's $20 short. He sends her a text as he sent it about \"not wanting to start an argument\" and about how he witheld $20 for the stovetop, the other two agreed about it, and she should just pay her \"fair share.\" When she says it's sketchy he's holding the $20 hostage especially when she didn't agree, he quickly escalates, telling her to \"fuck off\" and \"not be so selfish and stubborn,\" and have some sympathy for him getting his stuff stolen. Oh and also his prescription drugs he gives for free (\"don't worry about it, insurance\") suddenly \"aren't cheap.\" And \"is this the hill you want to die on? $20?\" He's still not given her the $20.\n\nMy gf is pissed and feels like she's being gaslit and I agree and am in shock at his responses, but AWTAs for objecting about the added expense?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631690533.0, "author_fullname": "re-fing-tweet", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/polawv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_friends_camp/"}, {"title": "AITA for not letting my family borrow my car", "content": "I (21F) have family visiting from my home country.

Then she got a little closer and all I could do was think about how it was finally happening.\n\nShe squeezed up really close next to me and looked up at my face. I'm not the most confident guy so all I could say was \"hi,\" to which she responded \"hi.\" Then she asked if I wanted to do \"something.\" I asked what \"something\" was.

A few minutes of incredibly awkward silence passed, and then she said \"I guess Kim (her best friend) was right.\" I asked what Kim was right about, and she explained that for several years, Kim has repeated again and again that I was only trying to get into her pants. Apparently, Kim put her up to \"testing\" me.\n\nI felt horrible. Immediately I apologized to Jess again, said that while I found her attractive I'd do nothing to hurt our friendship, and then apologized yet again. Jess accepted it while crying a bit. Then I told her she had nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter Jess went home, I got to thinking that it was incredibly meanspirited that she would do that to me. I apologized, but that juvenile high school prank just started to strike me the wrong way. I talked to my sister (who I can talk to about anything), who reinforced that it was disgusting behavior.

Curious as to how much she charges, I pull up her personal page and do some math.   \n\n\nRoughly, what was given to me came out to about $290 when she should've given me $400. This was disappointing and I felt scammed, gaslit, and emotionally abused. I don't know why she would take advantage of my kindness like this. I let her know that I expected more pictures pretty much immediately or whenever was comfortable for her (as long as it was soon) and called it a night.   \n\n\nLater on, when I told my friends what I was doing they acted like I basically just let out the world's grossest fart in front of them. They said I could go to jail and it's creepy as fuck but that's such bullshit.

We started off as friends 3 years ago, and I watched him get in and out of these really awful relationships with these terribly abusive and manipulative people. I mean just groomer level, possessiveness, verbal abuse sort of things. I helped him realize that he wasn\u2019t being treated well by these people and he finally cut these people off. Eventually we confessed to each other and now we\u2019re dating. Because of his past relationships and my own awful ones, I really wanted to reassure him that I\u2019ll always respect his boundaries.

What\u2019re you gonna get?\u201d I asked him and he said he wasn\u2019t hungry.\nI asked him if he was sure and he thought about it, and said he didn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of eating.\n\nThis got me a little upset and worried, since he was already sick and his eating habits consist of, well, not eating really. So I just said, \u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll wait till you eat something to have food.\u201d\nThat made him all worried for me, \u2018but you\u2019re hungry\u2019, \u2018you should eat now\u2019, \u2018what do you want, I\u2019ll get it for you now.\u2019\nI just insisted that I\u2019d wait and it was fine, because I wanted him to eat.\n\nEventually after a bunch of pouting over me not eating, we both ordered food and when it got here and he ate I asked if it was good and he nodded and basically finished the whole thing in a second which was cute so I teased him and said I guess he WAS hungry.

I\u2019ll try and keep it simple and to the point. \n\nI (26F) have a friend named P (26F) that moved to the other side of the world on Sunday. Since Halloween is her favorite holiday, P decided to throw a small costume party on Friday for our friend group. We both are friends with another girl B (26F), who brought along her boyfriend, F(29M). \n\nNow before this party took place, I was struggling to find the right Halloween costume because\u2026my breasts are on the larger side, 40DD to be exact. I\u2019m a curvy girl as well. But no matter what I wear, I tend tend to attract attention to my chest and I\u2019ve personally struggled with my self image since I hit puberty. After doing some looking and being persuaded by P, I picked a Wonder Woman costume. I really like it and even though people\u2019s eyes tend to go south, the costume looks great and makes me feel good. I didn\u2019t think it was extremely provocative at all. Just the standard Wonder Woman leotard, rope, etc. \n\nFriday night comes, I show up to the party and people seemed to really dig my costume and I was having a blast. Then B came along. \n\nWhen I greeted her, she kept giving me this tight, forced smile, while staring at my chest area and I started to feel a bit self conscious. Throughout the party, she kept glancing there and I started to get a bit self conscious. Then she told me, in front of everyone, that I was practically naked. She then said that me wearing that in front of her man was rude and that I needed to put some clothes on, in a sarcastic/joking tone. She said that what I was doing was \u201csketchy\u201d since I knew her man would be there and I never dressed this way before. She insisted she was kidding but it really didn\u2019t come off that way.  \n\nAt that point I was so embarrassed that I straight up left.

My ex (gf at the time) took a 3 day road trip to move me into school.\n\nAfter being on campus a few days, it became abundantly clear that I didn't see myself long term with her. I know that it sounds callous, but I've been feeling unmotivated to maintain a relationship compared to my motivation for immersing myself in my new environment. So I broke up with her on Sunday. \n\nI tried really hard to be civil and friendly, and even offered to buy her an early plane ticket back or let her stay as long as she wanted, whatever she wanted. She decided that she wanted to take her original flight back. We had a pretty okay few days since we had what I thought to be a pretty good rapport.\n\nWhile checking the orientation schedule this morning, I noticed that there was a speed-friending event that overlapped with when she needed to leave for the airport. This event was very important to me since I quit my job to do a master's fulltime in part to make more like-minded connections, and I feared that after classes started, people would be too busy to try to make friends. This was an insecurity that I've expressed often to my ex (back when she was still a gf), so it's something she knows and understands.\n\nI told her that I might have to drop her off a few hours early for her flight home, or that I'll have to leave early from the event but maybe a bit later than she'd like to leave for the airport, and was really stressed with how to plan for it logistically.\n\nMy ex said that calling an Uber was an option if it was truly that hard for me to plan around it and attending it was extremely important, but that it would be incredibly hurtful to her and that she would feel very disrespected and that she probably wouldn't be able to forgive me for it. I tried to make it up to her by taking her out to lunch instead of dropping here off early.\n\nI ended up staying for the whole event, and she called the Uber. She told me that she really can't forgive me for this particular act because to her it really caps what she considers a series of events that showed how selfish I was during the relationship (a recurring argument we had), and that she was not interested in even being friends. I feel like I've already done more than enough to be kind and supportive of her through the breakup, and that since the event was so important to me in context of why I gave up everything and started a master's in the first place, I'm justified.

She\u2019s one of the best people I know. She\u2019s been married to her husband \u201cB\u201d for a few years now. \n\n\u201cB\u201d was a chill and nice person when I first met him. We\u2019ve never been really close, but as I\u2019ll explain later on, I saw him regularly. I liked him a lot and thought that \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d were a cute couple.\n\nHowever, after knowing him for a few years, I now know his chill and nice side was just a facade. He is so incredibly emotionally abusive to \u201cA\u201d that it just makes my stomach turn. \n\nAt first, it started off with him wanting to go everywhere with \u201cA\u201d. Anytime \u201cA\u201d\u2019s friends, including me, invited her anywhere, she\u2019d always say to us, \u201cHey, \u2018B\u2019 is asking if he can come too.\u201d I thought it was just because they were in their honeymoon phase and that\u2019s why they always wanted to be together. However, it got annoying and weird really quickly because he would just always come, even though he was never explicitly invited in the first place. He would also come to events or situations that were suppose to be all-girls. For example, before Covid-19 hit, I planned to have this huge all-girls bachelorette party. However, lockdown happened and when restaurants reopened, I decided to invite two people only, my sister and \u201cA\u201d. I even explicitly said in the group chat that I was excited to have a \u201cgirls night out\u201d. But then, \u201cB\u201d shows up. He\u2019s known for months about my plans, even before the pandemic, that I wanted it to be an all-girls event. And just like usual, it changed the dynamic because it\u2019s just awkward to talk freely in front of someone that you\u2019re just not close with and someone who wasn\u2019t even invited in the first place.\n\n\u201cA\u201d complains to me all the time about how she feels suffocated because of him. They have been having a lot of martial problems these past two years. I don\u2019t know how, but I got roped into being their therapist/mediator. \n\nAs time went on, \u201cB\u201d has become more controlling. Like I said, it started off with him being super clingy. He has now forced \u201cA\u201d to:\n1) quit her job and find another one,\n2) moved with her into an apartment neither of them can afford,\n3) convinced her to get pregnant even though she said she didn\u2019t want to have a baby yet,\n4) took away her car keys and won\u2019t let her drive anywhere by herself (he or someone else has to drive her everywhere),\n5) convinced her that several male companions/friends were flirting with her because they \u201clooked her in the eyes while talking to her\u201d, so she\u2019s not allowed to talk to them again,\n\nAnd so much more! He has justified all the above in our \u201ctherapy\u201d sessions.\n\n\u201cA\u201d constantly tells me how miserable she is in her marriage and how she wishes she wasn\u2019t pregnant with his baby. She does not have any plans of divorcing him though.\n\nThere are two events that led me to writing this post. The first one being that I put my foot down ONE TIME and told \u201cA\u201d that \u201cB\u201d was not invited to our dinner plans. \u201cB\u201d proceeds to text me and get upset about not being invited. I stand my ground and so when the dinner plans roll around, \u201cB\u201d drops \u201cA\u201d off (because remember, she\u2019s not allowed to drive), he literally sits in the parking lot for hours until we\u2019re finished. He stays visibly upset with me for months after.\n\nThe second event is that I invited \u201cA\u201d over, but on the day of she says she can\u2019t come because \u201cB\u201d said that my pet\u2019s hair can be harmful to the baby. \u201cA\u201d has come over multiple times in the past and her and her unborn child have been absolutely fine. I was furious and chewed \u201cB\u201d out. He eventually relented and let her come over, but it\u2019s so frustrating that I had to fight for her come over.\n\nI\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m willing to give up my friendship with \u201cA\u201d if it means I\u2019ll never have to hear about or see \u201cB\u201d again. I\u2019m tired of listening to them fight or \u201cA\u201d crying to me about it. I\u2019m tired of having to go through \u201cB\u201d in order to talk to her. I\u2019m tired of seeing \u201cA\u201d be hurt all the time. I\u2019ve been speaking to her less and less these past few months, and it\u2019s been liberating to not be worn out with all the drama.\n\nMy sister says that I should continue my friendship with \u201cA\u201d because after I leave, she\u2019ll have to rely on her abuser even more.

Would like to include that to me A is a difficult person she can be a lot to handle is very loud she\u2019s that person that\u2019s always asking for free stuff or discounts everywhere bc she\u2019s always on a tight budget. So A decided last minute that she couldn\u2019t pay for everything with the other lady like she said she would and asked my friends boyfriend if he could pay for the other half of the venue which at first he agreed to but then he backed out because he wanted to be more involved with the shower that he was going to end up paying half for and she basically wouldn\u2019t let him so he ended up not giving them the other half of the money they needed for the venue because he felt like they offered to throw the shower so why would he have to pay for it and if he was he wanted to be involved. A did say at the beginning that she wanted to throw the baby shower for her and she was willing to pay for everything which I feel like isn\u2019t something you offer if you can\u2019t keep your word. Since friends boyfriend ended up not paying for it she told my friend that he couldn\u2019t come to the shower and it was girls only which her boyfriend was upset about and is still upset over a year later. (This happened before covid was a big deal in my area.) Now A son\u2019s is having a baby and she thew he\u2019s GF a shower as well and invited my friend which it was a mixed crowd of men and women. So my friend feels a way now that this same person told her that her boyfriend couldn\u2019t attend her baby shower. This has also caused some problems in her relationship.

He would never do that in front of me. I just told him to stop doing that and threw my towels in the wash. Didn\u2019t talk to him again. \n\nFew weeks later he wanted to talk, but I didn\u2019t. I said \u201cI have a lot going on and need to take some respectful distance for a while. I say that kindly &amp; hope we can maintain a considerate environment at home.\u201d Few hours later, ignoring my boundary, he sent a long text unloading about towel-gate, again that he\u2019s \u201cprovided everything in the house\u201d and listing his purchases + more claims about how much he\u2019s done for me.\n\nI annotated his text, sent it back to him. I called him out for claiming he \u201cprovided everything\u201d, pointed out all I\u2019ve bought that he uses constantly, said I could easily cover the cost of everything he\u2019s bought for the apt in 2 months tops with our $500rent diff. alone, that he has a warped view of things, called out his claims of being \u201cso accommodating &amp; considerate\u201d, said considerate would be taking out the trash on time &amp; respecting boundaries, and that IDK how he considers himself a \u201cclean freak\u201d with his lack of basic hygiene habits like taking out the garbage, etc. I didn\u2019t hold back at all. \n\nI have no desire to remain friends.

Therefore I told them via text, that I'm either gonna wear a dress or a long jumpsuit, but I haven't decided on a definitive outfit yet.\n\nThen my friend wrote, that \"the night wouldn't end well for me if people talk more about my outfit than the brides one.\" I answered, that \"I'm not planning on wearing the most fancy dress, just one suitable looking for a wedding and I'm definitely not wearing a suit.\" He than told me, that \"luckily there are other options aside from a suit or a dress, to look suitable for a wedding.\" Another guest then chimed in, that \"I should think about it. Nothing should distract from bride and groom on there wedding\".\n\nThey both raise very valid points, I know that. But I'm not planning on willingly distract from the bride and groom. All I want is to wear clothes I feel comfortable and I don't really like the \"other options\" or fail to see their point, because I don't wanna wear \"male clothes\" and any sort of \"female clothes\" is gonna distract from the bride and groom in some way. \n\nSo, Reddit, would I be the asshole for wearing a dress or jumpsuit to the wedding?", "verdict": "Not enough info", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631699177.0, "author_fullname": "PreciousPraline", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pomxft/wibta_for_wearing_a_dressjumpsuit_to_a_wedding/"}, {"title": "AmItheAsshole My Situation with my family.", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631699266.0, "author_fullname": "IndependentAthlete26", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pomy3c/amitheasshole_my_situation_with_my_family/"}, {"title": "AITA My current family situation", "content": " \n\nWelcome To anyone who reads about my situation\n\nMy childhood is mostly a blank though i renember a few moments here there mainly how i lived with a stepfather who did not care for me in the slightest. I renember how he used to beat up my mother when she was drunk. One of My parents is an alcoholic. Thats my mom and she gets drunk whenever stress comes into her life. She always keeps saying to me that \" I love you \" as many times as she is drunk.\n\nMy Stepfather gave me a lot of beatings one of his own was to do homework with me i was maybe 10 or 15 years old at that time . Whenever i couldn't figure out an answer or know what to say he would always just call me an idiot and spank me as hard as he could. There was one time where i was taking a shit in the bathroom and two of my sibling came into the bathroom to pester me. They wouldn't leave so i told my mom she got my step father to come in. When my stepfather came in he saw me saying \"Leave me alone or ill touch you with my shitty ass\" He Gave me a painful beating in that time. Which he apologised for. If it wasn't for my mother during that time he may have caused me serious injury. I sometimes got along with him sometimes i didn't.\n\nMy mother was mainly an alcoholic who according to my grandma was smart enough to do whatever she wanted. My mother even made my grandma adopt 3 kids from foster care by saying that she will take care of them after a few months she stopped taking care of them. She also has a knack for finding the most horrible people to be her husbands. I never met my father before he left my mother as i was very young at that time i renember nothing about him. The second person who she never married even though they had two kids didn't care about me at all. The third person that she is currently with is an alcoholic who always encourages her behaviour.\n\nMy grandma constantly tries to call her , but during her drunken stupor she never picks up the phone. Now that I moved out from her home she doesn't call me at all. She is currently taking care of my autistic brother who has gotten fat due to the fact that our country doesn't have any specialised centers for autists. She is always nagging me to get a job even though she never held a job for longer than a month due to her alcoholism. Whenever I try to tell her that her alcoholism is severely affecting my mental state she always says that \"It's your grandmas words\" and forgets about whenever i trie to tell something bad about her boyfriend she always deflects by saying \" It's not his responsibility\". She even lost her own daughter because of her alcoholism , but refuses to acknowledge that its a problem. She also asks for money from my grandma after which she gets she spends half of it on booze. She keeps telling me how she loves me and my brother. And that i will have to somehow take care of my autistic brother when she is no longer around.

However, my wife turned this down.\n\nInstead she agreed with my father that he would fund (with no strings attached) the startup business that she is passionate about and is in the field that she went to college to study. This would give her autonomy as well as satisfaction to do what she likes. \n\nHowever, 2 years later the business is not as successful as she\u2019d hoped. Regular startup complications. It takes time in her field to get recognition and gain market share before the larger revenues start coming in.\n\nDue to this, she has become delinquent on her loans and has fallen behind.

They are wanting to have their wedding in another state from theirs, while ours will be in our home state. Meaning, their wedding will cost more time and money for all guests than ours.

We both understand that it's an expensive month for you two with the house and the rest of your wedding and saving for a honeymoon. We want to pay for your accommodation for the wedding while you guys stay in Byron Bay for us.

All of their songs have become annoying and overplayed to me, and after hearing about all the drama they got into (I'm honestly too tired to even will myself to look it up again but a lot of big name KPop bands that he likes are... pretty racist) and the way they fucked with my brother's body image (he went on dangerous fad diets they used) I've grown to hate them over time.

We got into a huge fight about it. Like, a massive fight. I told him that we share our bedroom and he needs to talk to me before putting up posters, especially of things I don't like or that make me uncomfortable. I also argued that I don't have any posters- or anything for that matter, hung up in our room, which I don't (he already has a large calendar up in our room, a decorative fan, a flag, and his school schedule, and at one point LED lights, all of which he put up without my input).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPat, however, told me an array of things, his main talking points being that he's had this poster for a while and wanted to put it up and I shouldn't prevent him from doing that, and that this KPop band makes him happy, and that I don't want him to be happy(?) because I keep opposing this poster. I informed him that the band BTS makes me uncomfortable, but he is incredibly dismissive of this and even accused me of being racist (we are both mixed-race) to our mother because I do not like KPop music. My mother had to sit me down and seriously ask me if I was racist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe argued on the point for a while, but eventually it fizzled out and later that day, while Pat was napping, I just got so angry that he wasn't listening to my input, so I took the poster down myself. I didn't damage it at all, I took great care not to tear it and even removed the tape from the edges, folded it back as it had been before he put it up and put it back in his drawer. When he woke up and asked me where it was I freely told him what I had done, and that the poster was intact and in his bureau.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPat freaked out at me. He threatened some nasty stuff, called me a \"fucking bitch\" and didn't talk to me for the rest of the day.

There\u2019s probably typos because I\u2019m rage typing this when I should be asleep. \nThe Background: \nMy grandparents and their neighbors have been friends for nearly 20 years. My mom and I have moved in with my grandparents to help them out as they are getting older and have a lot of health issues. We moved in about 4 months ago. About two weeks ago one of the neighbors' grandma and sister came to live there. It\u2019s important to know the neighbors have an autistic son who acts out a lot. Well last Wednesday the neighbor's sister (I\u2019ll call her NS since it\u2019s simpler) came over complaining about the neighbor's autistic son saying he had been acting out for two days straight and she couldn\u2019t get any sleep. My grandparents offered the guest bedroom for a night, which was converted from part of the garage. My grandma later said to my mom and I \u201cthis will not become a habit.\u201d The next night she opens the door (without notice) and says she\u2019s tired and going to sleep. This has happened almost every night since. The only time she hasn\u2019t slept here is when one of my grandparents' step sons from a previous marriage (her ex boyfriend, by the way)came to visit. My mom and I are very upset about this for multiple reasons, some of which are very petty I admit. \nHere are the big reasons: \n\u2022I don\u2019t believe the neighbor's son is having a tantrum every night, which to me would be the biggest reason she couldn\u2019t sleep next door.\n\u2022My grandparents haven\u2019t told my mom or I that they have changed their mind about letting her stay over every night. I believe she is taking advantage of their friendliness, and their being uncomfortable about speaking up about it and rocking the boat.\n\nHere are the petty reasons, that I guess stem from the big ones: \n\u2022She always wakes my mom when she comes in because the door is loud and my mom is a light sleeper. \n\u2022She never sits down and has conversation with my grandparents, which my mom and I feel could be done as a courtesy for at least a couple minutes occasionally. \n\u2022The guest bedroom is between the panty and the garage where we store our second fridge. This second fridge is where I usually store my food and drinks. Now I\u2019m usually already in my bedroom at night but in the morning I get stuff from there, and I feel very uncomfortable having to go through an occupied bedroom. This is not an issue when, for example, my grandparents son comes over because he only stays there at most two night in a row and I can just wait to go through to the garage.  \n\nNow for the very very petty reasons: \n\u2022She makes herself my grandparents coffee every morning and leaves. Now I don\u2019t know if they had a conversation about that but I think it\u2019s rude. She also leaves the spoon she stirs it with dirty on the counter. This bothers my mom the most because she always keeps the counters clean, especially since we have a lot of files come in from outside. \n\nSo are my mom and I the assholes?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631601978.0, "author_fullname": "Green-Scarcity4409", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pnxlbg/aita_for_not_wanting_my_grandparents_neighbors/"}, {"title": "AITA For not being willing to help a stranger even though they\u2019re elderly?", "content": "For context, my Mother, my Baby Brother, and Myself were leaving the store and an elderly man walked up to my Mom while she was getting in the car.

My younger sister and I were more protected, and are also closer as friends. I love them both and want them in my life.\n\nSome years ago my younger sisters boyfriend died suddenly from a drug overdose. I was living out of state at the time, and as soon as I found out i took a flight home to be with her and support her. She was wanting to end her life for the first weeks and I basically was on death watch and slept in her bed every night while she was grieving, holding her and comforting her.

This was in April.\n\nLater that summer my older sister decides to get married to her longterm boyfriend. She decided to keep the wedding small, with no family except me and my younger sister - and just her friends. She was very vocal about not wanting the wedding to be a big deal, and keeping it really simple. She would be happy just signing the papers in court etc. I was already back home by the time the wedding was coming up, burnt out on the trauma and care taking of everything, and I asked my sister how she felt about me coming to the wedding. She said that I didn't have to come, she would feel okay about my not being there. The last minute plane tickets were expensive and I was exhausted, so I decided not to go. I'm someone that communicates very directly about things, and she is someone that will say something different than what is actually true for her and want others to read her mind based on assumed etiquette/assumptions.\n\nfast forward to now and it explodes in my face that I should have been at the wedding. She thought it was wrong for me to not go, that I should have gone to my sister's wedding, etc, even if she said it was okay for me not to go - i should have known it was the RIGHT thing. I do feel genuinely bad about it, and deeply regret not going and figuring out some way to have paid for the ticket/pull my shit together - but I was so so deeply tired at the time and really took my older sisters words to heart that it was okay for me to be there. However, I also see that I was only one of two family members invited and that it was rude to even ask if I should be there or not (I only asked because she kept emphasizing that her wedding wasn't a big deal).\n\nYes we are all in therapy and will continue to work out the deeper layers of this.

I was a freshman in college and we met during sorority recruitment. She ended up becoming my big sister in the sorority and I felt so lucky to have such a seemly wholesome and wonderful person as a big sister. Fast forward 2 or so years and she started dating a very abusive guy who constantly cheated, emotionally abused, and lied to her. Yet she stayed. This caused a major rift in our relationship because I thought she deserved more but she was \"in love\". We went about 8 months without talking to each other when she contacted me to make a mense. At this time, my husband (25M) and I had been dating for about a year. After my bestie and I made up, I still kept her at arms length because our trust had been bruised. When my husband proposed, she seemed so happy for us. But with every relationship (especially young ones) you get ebs and flows. While engaged, my husband and I had some seemingly big issues with him keeping a job, cleaning, and occasional emotional immaturity. I told her about these concerns because, if not resolved, I didn't know what our future would look like. But after us both going to therapy, we dealt with these problems and felt happier than ever. I asked my best friend to be my maid of honor and she seemed all good with us and so happy for us. \n\nCurrent situation: I moved to the same state my best friend was in and we barely saw each other. It felt like my husband and I were always going to her, which wasn't that big of an issue since we were able to make time. My husband has been unemployed for over a year. Which I made known bothered me to him. He's now in graduate school and working toward joining the military to create more structure and stability for us both. We also decided to return to our home state in the Midwest to be closer to family. When planning on leaving the state, I told my best friend that we were moving 3+ months in advance and when I tried to set up a day to hangout and say goodbye, she ghosted me. I didn't hear from her for over a month- not even on my birthday. I eventually called her and she said that she can't stand my husband. She said a lot of awful things about how she thinks he treats me, he's lazy, arrogant and a jerk. All of the examples she gave were either skewed opinions from me previously venting to her and problems my husband and I have worked through. I told her she gave me a lot to digest and left it at that. I haven't talked to her in 3 weeks now and am pretty done with her. I'd never felt so hurt that she would not talk to me or my husband about her concerns and let it fester to the point of just ignoring me entirely. But I don't intend on having a friendship where I'd essentially have to guard myself from bringing up my husband because \"he mentally drains and revolts her\".

Before I say anything else he is honestly and genuinely so kind and we fit well together in most ways and I do have intentions to marry him. While we've been generally happy, we've started to really fight about money. Its important to know that he has already graduated school and works in the morning and does artist work on the side and I am a full time college student, who works in the service industry, tutors for reading recovery, as well as participates in other various extras curriculars to add things to my resume as it is my senior year. This has been a small problem throughout our whole relationship but paying bills together has exasperated it. In my last long term relationship I was so used to paying for everything because he was unemployed who made me feel so guilty if he spent any money on me or if I got something a little extra like a soda instead of water when we went out to eat. So naturally when I started dating my current boyfriend I offered to pay for everything because I was just used to it.\n\nHe had never dated a girl who would pay for anything so he would always agree to let me pay. However this continued and he has since only paid for dinner maybe 5 or 6 times our entire relationship. To this day he never so much as speaks up or pretends to reach for his wallet when we are out on dates. His excuse in the past was that he was low on money because he didn't have a consistent job and I would offer out of guilt because more often than not I was the one who wanted to go to dinner or even if it was his idea if I got anything extra like a soda or an appetizer I would pay because I knew he hadn't planned to spend the extra money. He didn't have a consistent job because he is an artist and has been able to do odd jobs here and there in the spring and summer so that he could work from home. So all winter he promised that when it got warm he would take me out and treat me like how I have been treating him. But because of the economy and other outside situations he wasn't able to pick up as many odd jobs as he normally does.\n\nAt this time he was about to move in with me in July and I suggested he work in the kitchen at my job just to pick up some extra money. I'm a super hard worker so I knew the owners would have no problem hiring him too because they trust my judgement as an employee. He refused and told me he'd \"rather pick up pennies in the walmart parking lot than work at my job\". I suggested he think about something else but he refused and instead insisted he needed to work on his art for the summer and begin substitute teaching in the fall. During this time I bought almost all of the decorations and materials for the house. His father gave us a bunch of extra furniture but I bought so much to make our house cute and homey.\n\nHe was really good at saving his money so he managed to make it stretch all the way until august. He finally got hired for substitute teaching but unfortunately he got hired after the first pay date of the year and teachers and substitutes only get paid once a month so he did not have money to pay for rent. I ended up having to pay the entirety of rent and I bought him groceries for him numerous times. After this happened I became really frustrated and disappointed with him because I had been warning him for so long that if he didn't make some money this would eventually happen. We went back and forth a little, him saying that he has had no options and has to focus on his art, me saying that I get that but I am somehow able to maintain work and school and other things.\n\nI eventually started crying ended up saying that I was concerned that he was displaying similar traits to my ex boyfriend in not equally contributing to the relationship and I was so concerned about getting burned again because I put so much time and money into that relationship. I know I shouldn't have said that and I immediately wish I could have taken it back because he burst into tears saying how unfair I was being and how I shouldn't have said that.

At the age of 27 her parents married  her off to my dad. My mom was excited to be married because she thought that she begin a new life, uninhibited by past trauma. That didn't happen. My dad was a meek and silent mama's boy. My paternal grandparents and my dad's siblings verbally abused my mom, threatened to force my dad to divorce her and traumatised her and my dad did nothing.

I became depressed, and mentally unstable. I asked for psychiatric help but I was met with retaliation. My mother beat me up for even suggesting that she take me to a psychiatrist.

It got me pretty fed up since it was making her uncomfortable. Not like we haven\u2019t been over the paternity test thing before. To me there was no reason to question her when we already have the physical proof I\u2019m his father. The whole thing had soured my mood and I had my sister leave before my son even woke up. So she\u2019s pretty mad for kicking her out before even having the chance to meet him since she drove almost 4 hours over here. My sister says she just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t getting played, again her suspension is based on his skin color, and she has a right to demand answers since she\u2019s only looking out for me.

I do cut my nails, but then I wait for them to grow back a little and then trim them because I don't like my nails being completely cut and also because it affects my typing, maybe because I am habitual to typing with nails. He also keeps telling me that with grown nails I do not eat properly (we eat with our hands), which is not true. I like eating with a spoon and that is why I always prefer a spoon over hands.\n\nRecently, there was one such incident where he told me that I suffer from acne only because I am not cutting my nails as I want to follow the \"fashion\" of long nails which is causing my face to look like this.

Plus she never listens and you don't tell her anything so I have to. \nMom - You told her 2 days back to cut her nails and now again you are asking me to remind her to cut them. This is a repetitive behavior. \nDad - I don't remember telling her this 2 days back. You know she is wrong is growing nails, she is not suppose to when she has acne, plus she also cannot eat properly. \nMom - She likes eating with the spoon it's not like she feels uncomfortable eating with hands.\nDad - What is wrong, is wrong! And just because she's grown up that does not mean I will not tell her what is right or wrong. And you always take her side which encourages her to do all this. \nAnd then he just left. \n\nI feel the argument happened only because I told my mom I don't like his behavior and she tried to take my side, which caused this argument between them and dad being mad at her.

Not deathly, but enough that he will break out in hives and will puff up. Yesterday, Brady asked me about his allergy and how severe his reactions are. I said he would be very uncomfortable but he wouldn\u2019t die. Brady asked me whether he would need someone to look after him if he came in contact and had a reaction. I said probably even though I\u2019m no expert.\n\n90 minutes later, James had a reaction to some cookies Brady brought him and freaked out. Brady spent hours chilling with James and soothing him. He claims the bakery owner had specifically said they were peanut-free cookies and blames them for being careless. \n\nI am certain now that Brady purposely set off an allergic reaction in James, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be seriously harmed, so he could step in and comfort him after the fact.  This has been a pattern of behavior, and I believe Brady may have a crush on James, so he wants to be the good guy and rescue him. I told James, who was horrified and said that would make sense. Brady and James are not speaking at all now. Brady knows what I told James and said he is appalled and that I\u2019ve ruined their friendship over nothing.\n\nI want to be clear that I don\u2019t think Brady having issues has any relation to him being gay. I don\u2019t believe manipulative behavior has any gender or sexuality. But I absolutely believe he did this intentionally to look good around James.

After giving birth to both my sister she went through postpartum depression and my father being away for work, I had to look after the three of them.

Now that mom is slim and all she constantly comments on my body shape how my belly is hanging, how my breasts are saggy, how I always wear comfy clothes.

I screamed at my mom and told her that she was being fake by doing liposuction to her body and was being a hypocrite for shaming me.

You could place it on the other side of the kitchen, but then it would be completely in the way and destroy the open concept feeling completely. My brother doesn't cook at all. All he does is warm up sausages and have un-toasted bread for sides, that's it.\n\nI'm showering in a small bathtub/shower combo with the shower head hanging at around 170cm\\~ (old building standards), I'm 195, so showering is always annoying. The apartment we are arguing over has the bigger shower (not by much, 15-20cm maybe) so there's also no reason to really argue about it.\n\nIn the living area of the big room there would be a perfect niche area for my giant desk where i have all my gaming and office pc stuff. It would be a little separated from the rest which i prefer instead of having it standing somewhere in a square room next to a miss placed kitchen/dining-counter. My brother does have a desk in his room as well but afaik not as big and i think when he moves out and has something like a dining table it gets obsolete since he's not a gamer/office worker or anything so he has no use for an office desk per se.\n\nSo reddit, should i be happy and grateful with the choice of my parents?

I got along well with the dog owner but told her I did not want to be involved and to leave me out of it and if I had problems I'd let her know. The dog owner has recently gotten a new boyfriend and the last 3 weekends has been out at his place so between me and another tenant we've had to look after them. \n\n Friday my father came to visit me from my home town which is an 8 hour drive. I'd told the dog owner I'd be out this weekend and so was the other tenant. I'd come home Friday night late and saw a message saying she'd gone out and to please look after her dogs. She hadn't left a dog bed or any food and that annoyed me abit and I messaged her telling her as much. She apologised and said she'd be home the next evening to watch over them.\n\nSaturday night I'd stayed over by my aunt where my father was sleeping and Sunday I'd gotten a call from her telling me she'd left the dogs alone the previous night and they'd obviously gotten frustrated and had destroyed my mop, broom and bucket as well as a towel I had hanging over one of my patio chairs. She said she would replace them but told me I was irresponsible for just leaving my things outside. My mop was still wet as well as the towel and bucket and she'd previously told me that her dogs were well behaved and the other tenants were lying about her dogs. I didn't think they would destroy them. It wasn't like my things were strewn all over they were put neatly in a corner by my back door. \n\nThis morning our new property manager came by to take note of all the maintenance issues in my flat and I'd mentioned it to him as all the other tenants have easy access to the courtyard and also leave their mops outside but she'd locked the dogs out of the courtyard which also has their dog house. \n\nThe property manager has offered to fence off my small patio area as he feels I have every right to keep those kinds of things outside and not have them destroyed. I'm pretty nervous about the blowback from her and I don't want our good report with each other ruined. I feel that there needs to be a balance. She's the only one with dogs and they kind of rule the backyard. I am also very unhappy about the fact she just leaves them unattended without food and a proper place to sleep.

I (19F) and my (21M) brother have recently had a very bad argument. He says I need to get a real job. I was babysitting for a couple of months until the lady I babysat for stopped due to family issues. So for now I\u2019ve decided to donate plasma to help with expenses. I also get a little over $500 at the beginning of every month. And I usually get myself a small tattoo and the rest of the money goes into the house we live in or into other expenses like bills. We live with our grandpa and dad. I also am currently studying to be a cosmetologist. So between school and other personal matters I rarely have time to look for a job or anything as I\u2019m usually tired from doing homework and making sure I keep my grades up. Now for why we got into the argument. I told him if he wants to be telling me that, he needs to follow his own advice or do what I\u2019m doing until I get a job and donate plasma. I also told him he needs to quit being lazy, and actually help out around the house more than just taking out the trash. That he needs to quit playing video games all day and sleeping when he\u2019s not playing video games and actually do something productive with his time. I told him I\u2019m the one that cooks, does laundry(for me, him, and my dad sometimes because our dad is disabled), and takes care of our two dogs and cat we have. If anything I\u2019m one that should get to relax but I never get to. He still said that I\u2019m lazy and needs to do more. There was a few words exchanged but it was pretty much the same things repeated. A day or so later our dad said, what I told my brother was rude and that I\u2019m being an insensitive b**** and need to apologize to my brother. I told him I won\u2019t be apologizing for telling my brother the truth, but since then they\u2019ve both been making me feel guilty and like an ass for going off on him. \n\nSo AITA for going off on my brother?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631522049.0, "author_fullname": "Marvel_nerd18", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pnbfld/aita_for_going_off_on_my_brother/"}, {"title": "WIBTA if I doubt my bio dad?", "content": "Throwaway for personal reasons. \n\nI am a twin sister (15F) to another twin who is male (15M).

We received abusive messages whilst I was in hospital giving birth because we didnt \"invite them\" into meet her, when they knew what hospital I was giving birth in.\n\nFast forward to my daughter almost being 2. They havent given her anything. Havent offered to buy her anything she might need. Didnt give her a gift for her first birthday or Christmas they havent so much as bought a packet of nappies.

But they ruined my first few days with my daughter with countless abusive messages and phone calls.

We had a late morning and didn't get spend anytime together, because we were constantly running errands for the party, so my mother had our daughter most of the morning before the party.

I just wanted to tell him why I had gotten upset. I told him, that it was completely unfair of him to lie to me to avoid spending time with me and his daughter.

The eldest died recently in a horrible and tragic way that broke all of us. The second eldest was stillborn, but was able to be revived. She sustained brain damage that left her disabled for life, and she recently was given a terminal diagnosis. She\u2019s nearing the end of her life. Then my other brother, my mum had a miscarriage, followed by me and my (stillborn) twin. She had another set of twins (miscarry and stillborn), then my other sister who later died of SIDS. \n\nMy sister\u2019s diagnosis and my eldest brother\u2019s death broke us all. I think my mother felt that, now that she\u2019d gotten us all into adulthood, she\u2019d get to keep us. The last year proved otherwise.\n\nAs such, she\u2019s grown quite protective of us. Not overbearingly so (mostly) but part of it is that, if she can, she wants to drive me places to make sure I\u2019m safe. \n\nI recently started uni and one of my new friends found out my mum was driving me most days. He told the friend group (not in a malicious way). One of the guys started making jokes about it. Calling us codependent, telling me to cut the apron strings, time to leave the nest and grow up, that adulthood is going to hit me hard, I don\u2019t understand what real life is going to be like (he said this 2wks after I helped plan my brother\u2019s funeral), kind of things. Just once or twice a day, but it built. Especially when he started saying things like \u201coh come on, you\u2019re a teenager, what can you know about real life?\u201d And when I said nothing, he\u2019d go \u201cexactly.\u201d \n\nYesterday, he said something about my mum being controlling and how I\u2019m going to get a real reality check when I grow up and I just\u2026 blew up. I really embarrassed myself. I started crying. I ranted about how he had no idea what we\u2019ve been through, why wouldn\u2019t I do something that\u2019s so easy on my end but gives her so much peace? I said it was shitty of him to speak about someone else\u2019s family when he had no idea what we\u2019ve gone through. \n\nIt\u2019s been awkward since. Nobody\u2019s really mentioned it, but most of them have kind of distanced themselves from me. I\u2019m worried I might be the asshole because, from his perspective, he was just ragging on me a little bit in good fun.\n\nIn hindsight, I realise I could have handled it better if I\u2019d told him privately, but I just\u2026 didn\u2019t want to. I hate being that girl with dead siblings. People act really awkward after they find out, especially about my brother. They don\u2019t know what to say. Some friends used to bring up that I was born a twin as a \u2018fun fact\u2019 to their parents *in front of my mum*, which was gutting. So I never told him. \n\nI told him my mum was off limits, but in a light tone. I don\u2019t want to be that person that uses my brother\u2019s death as an excuse to behave like a jackass.

We met in junior year by a mutual friend that we both went to high school with. We fight a lot and disagreements very often but it has never gotten to this level. \n\nLong story short, she has a 5 year old son who is not very well behaved. He has zero manners or care for other people, but I\u2019ve never mentioned it because I know its not my place to speak. I have a child of my own, too. They were born only a few months apart but my son is way more well behaved and better mannered than hers. \n\nWe decided to go on a lunch date and then to the local zoo that was giving away free-entry for all vaccinated persons. Things started getting out of hand when we got to the restaurant. Her son started yelling at the top of his lungs (for the entire restaurant to hear). It was a very, very, embarrassing experience, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind at all, as if this happens all the time. He started throwing food at my son to which I played off, because I figured kids will be kids. We packed up and headed to the zoo. As we went to go get our wristbands for entry, her child absolutely refused to let the woman put it on his wrist and screamed bloody murder. The ticket salesperson eventually ended up just having to give it to us to let him do it himself. \n\nFor the majority of our time there, things were fine. Then, once again, her son started throwing a fit. He threw food at the animals and smacked them when they didn\u2019t pay attention to him. The behavior he was exhibiting was completely embarrassing to not only her but me. She did nothing to stop his behavior. I politely told her that her son was being a complete brat and that she needs to scold him or else this will never stop. She retaliated and told me that scolding your own children is \u201ccruel and mean\u201d to them. She went on a tangent about how I\u2019m a \u201cbad mom\u201d and accused me of hitting my children (which I have never done in my life) in front of the entire zoo. I defended myself and cleared up that I have NEVER hit my children.  She accused me of something not only false but CAREER-RUINING in front of at least 20 other people. Finally, I  gave it to her straight and told her he needs serious attitude reinforcement. And, VERY maturely, she hit me and shouted a chain of curse words at me. In a moment of impulsive rage, I hit her back, perhaps a little bit too hard. I regretted it almost immediately when I saw heads turn.  I know it made a terrible example in front of the kids yet I did it. She called over an employee and had me escorted out of the zoo.\n\nToday, I learned from our mutual friend that she plans on suing me for assault. I\u2019m lost and unsure what to do. I know that what I did was wrong, but she swung first. I\u2019m scared that I might get charged and I genuinely can not handle a lawsuit right now.

Not to brag about it but i was the only friend who really chose to stay close to her.\n\nThe next 6 months were possibly the best in my life, i felt like i was really helping her out and also i felt that she cared a lot about me. In december i told her everything i felt for her, but she rejected me because she wasn't ready for another relationship.\n\nFlashforward to July when she all of a sudden started to stop \"interacting\" with me like she used to, and went kinda silent, answering me only when it was really necessary. I started to worry about her but i thought that maybe she wanted to be alone for a while.\n\nA month later, when we were on a vacation with a group of friends she told me that in that period she became \"selfish\". But the thing that really made me feel bad was that i noticed she was talking more to other people than me and was like she was avoiding me.\n\nAnd then shit happened, while we were on vacation i drunk too much and didn't feel well (my dad passed away in may) and i accidentally told her that i still loved her; she rejected me for the second time but this time because i was a \"too close\" friend for her.\n\nAfter the vacation we meet eachother to discuss the matter and she also said that she forgot what happened in that 6 months, because it was \"too ugly to remember\" and consequently she forgot everything i did for her. Also she said that she didn't write me for the whole july because she wanted me to detach from her.\n\nA few weeks later she told me that she meet a guy and have sex with him at a party, which i think is a lie; that night i really felt bad, i couldn't sleep, and i wrote her a letter in which i wrote everything i felt for her; i know it was a really toxic thing to do but i felt confused and strange in a way i still can't describe.\n\nShe didn't reply to me.\n\nAfterwards i went on another vacation, this time with my family, and i thought a lot about how she treated me, and i realized that, even as a friend, she didn't have to lie to me or to use childish tricks like not answering me to tell me that she was not interested.\n\nSo i wrote her a second message where i told my point of view and that how she treated me hurted me, and she replied that she felt bad for what i wrote in the first message and that i was the childish one.

My fiancee asked me what I wanted for my birthday as I had quite bad parents who would always try to make me feel terrible about my birthdays by deliberately getting me excited about a thing, then getting something completely different and vilifying me when I got upset. (Including one year where they dropped hints that they were going to buy me a new guitar, getting me excited for a whole year, only to be gifted a pound shop badminton kit with a note saying I needed to lose weight. They were very emotionally manipulative!) I asked for a specific type of budget-friendly vinyl cleaning machine (normally under \u00a380) as my brush and cleaning solution don't really help with some of my more tarnished older lp's, and this machine would really help me maintain things better. I saw this machine on her computer while I looked over to talk to her one night and have been getting excited about it for weeks now. My birthday is on Friday, but in a rush to get to class, my fiancee left the box for my gift open waiting to be wrapped, I saw it and she's instead got a really cheap gimmick version of the brush that I already have and don't like using. I know she would never want to let me down deliberately like my parents did but I can't help but feel extremely disappointed by this and a little hurt that she didn't listen when she made the effort to ask and look for my present (I looked online at the particular product that I wanted, and it's in stock in every shop, so I ruled out it being out of stock).

We asked her NOT to feed him any adult dog treats as he has a sensitive tummy, she constantly fed him adult dog treats and told us her \"alpha method\" of training was better than our positive reinforcement training. We were meant to get married 2 years ago and she invited loads of people I had not met and we had to cancel because there was too many people and we could not afford it. She is also constantly putting her son down all the time, telling him he needs to lose weight, he needs to exercise, he needs to eat more healthy. Yet at the same time she brings us homemade tablet and chocolate sweets.\n\nNow here is where it gets tricky, we bought our own house recently. A beautiful 4 bedroomed house with a massive 0.5 acre garden. Now, without her and her partner buying this house would not be possible. They gave us \u00a340k deposit for it. So I am obviously extremely grateful and she helped us move and it was fine and we were all getting along.\n\nNow this garden at our house, it is stunning. Trees, plants, massive area of grass for the dog, I just love it. As it was an elderly gentleman in the house on his own before we bought it, it needs some maintenance. Weeds, self seeded plants everywhere and trees covered in Ivy. Now the moment we saw the garden we both fell in love. And I was really really really looking forward to taking my time de weeding it and planting new plants, planting fruit and veg and making it our own lovely space.\n\nLast week my fianc\u00e9 came to me and said \"mums offered to come down during the week for a few days when we're working and do the garden\" My heart fell. This was my area, my garden, my thing that I was going to do. I explained to him I was really looking forward to tackling it on my own and we went back and forth for a bit and eventually settled on her coming down for a weekend to \"show us her expertise\" (she is no expert, but she knows more about plants than we do but nothing a quick google wouldn't tell us) I was fine with that because it was just a weekend and I would be there with her. Then that somehow changed to her staying a few days after the weekend and doing stuff in the garden while we're working.\n\nI know that she is just trying to help and I am extremely grateful for everything her and her partner have done for us but I just don't want my garden to be another thing she makes into her own.\n\nso WIBTA if I did as much garden work as I could before she comes down in 11 days?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631526060.0, "author_fullname": "Scribbles285", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pnc6rc/wibta_if_i_was_to_do_as_much_garden_work_as/"}, {"title": "AITA for announcing to my girlfriend in advance that I want us to break up", "content": "I have been in a relationship with a certain girl for a total of  4 years and we weren't in relationship for a whole year last year.So I work at my family business and my girlfriend and I met at work and we work together but she original came to my area for work and is expected to leave the area in 15 days back to her place.

We\u2019ve been together going on five years. Both go to the same college, and it would be a lot cheaper to live together. \nLast October, Lindsey (26F), his eldest sister, and I had a misunderstanding, and it\u2019s affecting me to this day because his family does not like me. The thing is, he is very close to them. He has four sisters and is the only boy. In 2020, he decided to move in with Lindsey( 26F) and Becky (21F), his two older sisters. This last year, I have gotten to know  Lindsey, and all she does is cause drama. She has since moved out and lives two hours away from the old apartment. (Becky and my bf live in the same apartment as of fall of 2021) Occasionally, Lindsey will come to their apartment stay as long as she wants. Her husband is in the military, and his base is about an hour from the old apartment, and even he will do the same thing except leave the house a mess. I have recently found out that Lindsey talks a lot of crap about me and hates me. She says things like I\u2019m trying to trap her brother by getting pregnant and even took it as far as tricking me into giving her my phone to make a call and deleted a video I have of her going into Becky\u2019s ex-GF\u2019s room. (Which was a harmless video) A couple of years ago, she got an apartment with Becky and Becky\u2019s GF(21F). When they broke up, Lindsey would do things to the ex-girlfriend\u2018s stuff like dunk her toothbrush in the toilet, take clothes from that girl's room and donate it, and even try putting Nair in her shampoo bottle. That\u2019s only some of the things. I\u2019ve been thinking recently, and when I move in with him, I want to get the locks changed for the front door (we will be staying in the same apartment) because Lindsey has given everyone that she knows that apartment key. She\u2019s given one to all her friends, every single member of her family, and STILL has one as well as her husband. Becky has tried asking for the keys back from Lindsey and her husband, but she refuses. There\u2019s no reason why those two should have a key. Lindsey has her apartment, and her husband has his apartment at the base. Since Lindsey\u2019s apartment is about a 4-hour drive from her husband\u2019s base, and if they both drive to the old apartment, they both drive about two hours and use their sibling's apartment like a hotel, which bothers me. The rest of their family lives six hours away, so it doesn\u2019t make sense why they all have a key. I wouldn\u2019t feel safe knowing that 15 people have a key. Their family comes to visit like three times a year and never uses the key. Lindsey could come in when my boyfriend and I aren\u2019t there and go through all my stuff and ruin some of my belongings.

My sister is already settled in a job and I have just graduated and doing internships for now. We live with our parents.

We live in a rented place, but my parents saved up and purchased a house of their own so they can rent it out and gain some bucks, and live there when they retire. So the thing is we live in a very prime and popular city where we are on rent, let's name it City A But my parents have bought a house in a very unsafe and outskirtsy area in a city close to City A. Let's name it City B.\n\n\nSo the matter is City A is extremely good for me and my sister, career wise and social life wise and we love it here. But the thing about City B is that it is at an area where there are a lack of career opportunities and facilities but my parents really want to permanently move in there for following reasons.\n\nMy father has moved to a new company recently and it takes a very long time and a lot of money for him to go and come back from his office everyday from City A (where we live). Apparently, it would take lesser time and money for him to go to his office if he lived in City B.\n\nMy parents are very keen on moving to City B and that means we(4 people) entirely would have to move to City B. That means me and my sister have to leave behind our social lives, and current job/internship. Which we do not want to do that.\n\nA huge conflict started when we expressed to our parents that we don't wanna move.

But we have never lived without them and admittedly don't know how to handle a lot of things on our own.\n\nMy parents felt disrespected when we told this idea to them cause they feel moving out would mean we are \"abandoning\" them.

She refuses to try anything else). She also heavily relies on drinking to relax, so she often combines the two, and ends up playing music until midnight, gets drunk, and then keeps me up allnight vomiting due to her actions.\n\nFor these reasons, I can't stand her music career, and her reliance on alcohol. She treats her singing and guitar playing like it's an uncontrollable thing that she will die if she does not do. (Now listen, I'm a writer. I get it, creativity and artistic passions are something we usually don't want to control, it's who we are. I can look at a flower and start to write an entire story based around that one flower.

But I wouldn't be asking if I'm the asshole if I thought I already knew the answer.\n\nThis is her passion, her life, who she IS. Her other 3 kids didn't bat an eye. But me? I had to ruin all of it. Now she can't play music every day and express herself, she can't drink to calm herself down as much as she used to. I've changed her life, I've ruined her life because of my stupid fears and such.\nI understand why she feels like the victim.

Jenny has a younger brother (19M), let's call him Dan.\n\nJenny and I were pretty much just friends because our parents are friends so our families would set us up on playdates and send us to the same activities. However we didn't actually have that much in common so as we got older we drifted apart. The main breaking point was in middle school after I became friends with a girl who hated Jenny, and Jenny hated her back. They got into a physical fight (not involving me) and Jenny broke some of her fingers. Afterwards she wrote a nasty multi-paragraph Facebook post bashing both of us and we never spoke again.\n\nA few years after that Jenny and Dan's family moved away and I barely thought of them again until last year when my mom let me know that Dan would be starting at my college. It was probably only due to her telling me this that I recognized him at a party. We started talking and laughing a lot and then went back to my dorm. Not to be too graphic but before that night I didn't think that I would ever enjoy sex. After that we dated in a really casual sense of the word...... We mostly just walked around campus and exercised together and hooked up. The energy between us is 100% just friends with benefits and not romantic even though I like him a lot and he's just a ridiculous, hilarious, sweet human being. At the end of the school year he told me that an old girlfriend had texted him wanting to reconnect and I pretty much told him to go for it.\n\nA couple weeks ago Dan texted me and we ended up watching TV with his roommates and then lightly hooking up again. One of his roommates was taking pictures with a film camera which I didn't think anything of but he ended up posting them to his Instagram account and tagging Dan. Most of the pictures weren't super incriminating but there's one where I'm basically in his lap. Dan told me that Jenny saw the pictures and lost her shit. She has been calling us both disgusting and acting like I'm a creep because I knew him when he was a kid (he's only 2 years younger than us).\n\nJust to put every factor on the table I do have memories of Jenny and I kissing each other as kids but it was always completely innocent. For example she used to kiss me when we were re-enacting a scene from a princess movie. However it's something that could contribute to Jenny feeling weird about me and Dan. The funny thing is that Dan has been under fire for us \"dating\" since it would be too awkward to explain the truth even though we NEVER dated or have any desire to date. Their parents have been getting involved which is the thing I feel most bad/ embarrassed about since they're both good people who've always been nice to me.

Why you hating?\u201d\r\n\r\nMe: \u201cWhoa, I apologize if it sounds like I was putting you down,  I didn\u2019t mean to offend you,  it\u2019s just not for me\u201d\r\n\r\nHim:  \u201cwhatever bro,  you just mad,  I\u2019m out\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I left the conversation there.   A couple of days after that,  I get a call from an unknown number.  It\u2019s his cousin,  and he\u2019s mad.  He\u2019s calling me a hater and saying that that we should be lifting each other up   I explain, like before,  that I\u2019m not trying to put him down.   He asked me to listen,  I listened,  I didn\u2019t like it.  So then he puts me on speakerphone,  and they are both there.  They keep telling me that I was wrong for what I said and that I have terrible taste in music and blah blah blah.  I apologize again and say sorry for offending them.   He then says that I\u2019m hating on him because I wish I was him and that I\u2019m a failure and I wish I could be successful.   \r\n\r\nSo then I got honest with him.   I told him that he\u2019s 36 years old and he works a part time job while living with his mom and he thinks he\u2019s a rapper.  I told him the reason he hasn\u2019t gotten his big break is because he\u2019s making bad music.  I pointed out that not a single one of his youtube videos had more than 500 views and some of them were uploaded almost 10 years ago.   No positive comments.   No likes.  So apparently I\u2019m not the only person who doesn\u2019t like his \u201cmusic\u201d.\r\nSo of course that made him angry.   He started to say something and I cut him off.   I said something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth and I\u2019m telling you what you need to hear.  Your friends/family are the ones lying to you and telling you how great your music is.\u201d  I told him I believe in honesty. I said everyone should certainly chase their dreams,  but at some point you have to realize when it\u2019s just not going to happen.\r\n\r\nThey hung up after saying a few more things.\r\n\r\nI told the story to my cousin yesterday and he said that I was being an asshole and I should have just told him that I liked it from the beginning.  \r\n\r\nSo now I\u2019m really curious and I\u2019m ready for Reddit\u2019s opinion", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631433681.0, "author_fullname": "RascalRibs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmon5e/aita_for_being_honest/"}, {"title": "AITA for refusing to send my ex money or listen to her personal problems?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631433718.0, "author_fullname": "WildUnderstanding793", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmoney/aita_for_refusing_to_send_my_ex_money_or_listen/"}, {"title": "Rebuild the Soviet Union", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631433760.0, "author_fullname": "dxbmx", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmonpu/rebuild_the_soviet_union/"}, {"title": "AITA for leaving a letter on my mom and siblings grave that hurt the feelings of my blended family?", "content": "When I was 7 I lost my mom and twin siblings. She was 7 months pregnant with them at the time and all I knew back then was she went to the hospital and two weeks later I was told she wasn't coming home and the babies wouldn't be either. My dad met his second wife Norah 7 months later. She was a widow with a 2 year old and a 6 month old. They fell in love fast and decided we should be a family through adoption. I didn't want to be adopted and said so when asked, they told me it would mean so much to everyone and would be good for me because I would be able to stay if something happened to my dad, so I agreed to it but was never actually on board. They called themselves my parents, she introduced herself as my mom, and my stepsiblings said we were just siblings. I fluctuated a lot. And was put into therapy to try and remove the step permanently. But the feeling was never there. I missed MY mom and MY siblings. Norah and my stepsiblings never meant the same to me or as much. I never wanted to be a dick about it though.\n\nIt was the 10th anniversary recently and I went to the grave and placed a note on there basically saying how much I missed them, how I wish I had the chance to be the twins big sister and nothing was ever the same without them or mom, how much her loss still impacted me and I would give anything to have them back. Since nobody but me really visits the grave anymore I didn't see the issue with it. But then my dad took the kids and they read the note.\n\nPretty much everything imploded on itself. Norah asked me did I regret the adoption and I said yes. My dad asked how I could write something that would crush Norah and the kids, because the note made it pretty clear he said to anyone who read it that I considered mom and the twins my only mom and siblings, that even without being stated directly it was clear. I told him I did not expect them to see it. That nobody else had visited the grave in four years. He told me it wasn't an excuse because I still left it there, but I also feel that way after close to a decade and imagine how painful it is for them to realize they love someone who never returned it, who never wanted it, even though everybody else has been happy.\n\nNorah told me I need to consider whether I'm going to work on moving past this and embracing them fully, the way they've embraced me or whether we're going our separate ways as soon as I turn 18. Dad said they will pay for therapy if I am willing to love and accept them as my mom and siblings the way they deserve.\n\nAITA?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631433770.0, "author_fullname": "Cute-North-7171", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmonsj/aita_for_leaving_a_letter_on_my_mom_and_siblings/"}, {"title": "AITA for trying to joke around with my dad?", "content": "On mobile.\n\nContext: We tend to laugh and joke around with my dad cause he claims he's a \"cool\" dad, we jokingly say he's senile cause he's forgetful and it's an inside joke among the family.

My dad has been the sole person paying into both my parents' life insurance premiums.  We have been a well-off family and I am very fortunate.\n\nMy dad ended up taking on my mom's life insurance policy through the divorce settlement.  My mom had wanted to cancel it and I think my dad found this unacceptable after paying it for so long (it had already been ~10 years) so somehow it was agreed that he would own the policy.  My mom still has control of who the beneficiaries are (my sibling and I), whereas he has control over terminating the policy or continue paying it.\n\nHe is now suggesting splitting my mom's life insurance three ways, between my brother, me, and him.  If we don't want to pay, he said he'd continue paying for us.  He also brought up the current costs of his new mortgage (he recently moved into a new house after his divorce) and his own life insurance policy.  Not sure why he brought this up.  Maybe it was because he wanted to show in a non-explicit way that he has a few financial burdens.  He still has some leisure/enjoyment expenses that he also didn't mention, but generally he is very financially responsible.\n\nAnyways, I responded with a big \"no\" to the suggestion because I felt like this was not my responsibility to pay the third even if this burden fell on him after the divorce.  I just wasn't there for the divorce, and I ultimately don't think this should have come up in the first place!\n\nI tried my best to come up with a very measured and respectful initial email to this suggestion by also thanking him for continually paying for these policies and for looking out for our wellbeing at the time of the divorce.  Although I phrased it as being his obligation to pay for the policy.  He texted back and retorted, saying something like \"thanks for thinking you know my divorce settlement more than me\", and he told me that he took my interpretation of the divorce personally because it was biased.\n\nI told him it was his fault that he take it personally since I was just trying to make the best call with any information I could recall about the life insurance policies, and that I even thanked him for paying!  He offered some more information about the divorce but I could tell he was not pleased.\n\nI wrote back another neutral second message to him and my sibling, this one was more empathic to his viewpoint and assumed my mom was a witch.  But, I still declined to pay the third.  I thanked him again for taking it on and making an initial payment towards the policy.  \n\nMy brother seemed upset by the fact I wouldn't pay my third into the deal, because him and Dad would need to pay for it then. I responded to him and Dad saying that it isn't his responsibility to pay for Mom's insurance either, and that I don't think it's right that we are involved in this.\n\nAITA?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631435288.0, "author_fullname": "heavyfork1234", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmoy80/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_a_life_insurance/"}, {"title": "WIBTA if I reported asshole mods?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631435453.0, "author_fullname": "Fuckyoureddit1967", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmozd0/wibta_if_i_reported_asshole_mods/"}, {"title": "AITA for exposing guy creep to girl who ends up dating him", "content": "April:Guy(19M) sends unsolicited erotic pics of himself to my friend (16F) (I.e jizz on his boxers , him sucking his fingers, his bulge) and ends up begging for nudes .

I felt upset he wouldn't ask me first if that was okay, considering we both know I'm a very private person, and I am very careful with who enters my spaces, due to spiritual reasons. He knows I'm very protective in this sense. I didn't say anything, until I woke up around 3am and saw a snap of the person sitting on the arm of our couch, Snapchatting them drinking hours earlier. I felt an invention of privacy, and felt upset that he would \"tell\" me someone I don't know is there, is there, instead of asking me first if it's okay. I decided it was late enough to tell him how I felt because I just couldn't sleep. I called, he didn't answer. I texted him and called again. He finally answers, and I just go off. This is where I think I'm the asshole, I just was absolutely lit up. For context, he's emotionally cheated on me before with his ex and a female best friend (like, graphic sexting), and has lied to me in the past about some very serious personal details (like his age, money, etc). We have major trust issues and just recently, he tore something from my hands that I was holding, which caused an uproar from me, telling him he would never get used to mistreating me like that. He felt bad, apologized and we moved on. But I told him, I don't forget. I am currently on my period after not having it for 3 months, and I'm very hormonal and cranky right now, so I feel I should of had more self control. We just went through some traumatic things the past 2 months (I was pregnant, was going to get an abortion, had an ectopic pregnancy, had to get serious surgery for it, we started new jobs, my friend just died, etc). I don't wanna justify my reaction, but I can't help but to feel anyone would be upset if they invited a stranger to their place without asking their partner first.\n\nAm I wrong?\n\nTDLR: My husband invited a guy I don't know to \"guys night\" without asking me first, and I blew up because we have trust issues.", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631437992.0, "author_fullname": "iamanonymousgirl", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmpgkz/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_husband_for_inviting/"}, {"title": "Am I the but hole for not wanting to go to the shop", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631438371.0, "author_fullname": "Galaxy-gachagamer-", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pmpj0l/am_i_the_but_hole_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_the/"}, {"title": "AITA for shouting at my BiL?", "content": "Myself, husband and 3yo daughter went out to a funfair with my sister who is 5 months pregnant and my brother-in-law. \nMy 3yo wanted to be pushed in her pushchair for the walk home, because we\u2019d done a lot of walking and running around and she was tired.

I didn't want to tell anybody right away since I wasn't in a relationship with my son's father and didn't want to be judged. Low and behold, I was judged anyways when they found out. \n\nWhen I told my brother that I was pregnant, he accused me of getting pregnant on purpose to \"take the attention away from [his] son\" even though I was told at 16 that I couldn't get pregnant due to medical reasons so I wasn't even aware that it was possible for me. He also called my sons father and my son \"nasty n-words\" with the hard r and everything. (Without the hard r it wouldn't have been okay either obviously) Although my son's father is a terrible person for unrelated reasons, calling him the n-word is way too far, especially when he included my son in the statement as well. I had never heard him be racist like this before, especially not with a mixed child of his own on the way. I was only about 3 months pregnant when he said these things and it resulted in me blocking him and his wife on everything and vowing to never see or speak to him again. \n\nNow my son is almost 2 and my mom is starting to talk about the holidays again. She wants to have the family together for the holidays but I am adamant saying that we can have separate holiday celebrations and that they are not family to me or my son.

My mom wants me to invite my brothers wife and son because my brother will be working, but I am still refusing. I don't consider him or his wife and son to be my family because what he said about an unborn child is disgusting and evil.

Unlike me, i dont really do parties and im very shy and enjoy my alone time in my room. I go to a massive state university where it is virtually impossible to meet people.

In fact i basically never saw this friend as she spent literally every free moment she had in her sorority friends dorm. It was a little upsetting to me at first but i figured i would j go home for the few hours i had then j drive home. Well anyway the 3rd day, my car broke down. There has also been numerous times where we would have plans to hang out and she would get invited to the girls house and basically guilt me into saying i wouldnt be mad if she went. Obviously she\u2019s allowed to have other friends idc ab that but the fact that shes willing to drop me completely in the middle of plans to go to their house makes me feel like shit honestly. Tonight we were in my room j hanging out when she got a ft from them saying to come over. When she said she was with me they mocked her as if i wasnt there. She then ended up telling me she wanted to go and knowing i was upset, gaslighted me until i said i wouldnt be mad. Im a pretty easy going person usually but all summer she would yell at me to kick my bf out so i could go there to hang out w her, yell if i was late to any plans we made, and have me slleep over weeks at a time if her parents went out of town.

He would later on drug me, r*pe me, gaslight me, mentally and verbally abuse me, attempt to poison me (I have severe allergies, eating certain things is like literal poison to my body), and occasionally hit me.

I\u2019ve hit it off with every single person within that group. In total there\u2019s 6 of us and I\u2019m the youngest so everyone is very kind and is pretty considerate of me. There\u2019s one other girl in the group (26F we\u2019ll call her Tori) and the rest are guys, we\u2019re all truly just friends. We hang out often, having lunch/ dinner together, we go shopping, and sometimes we\u2019d have movie nights at someone\u2019s house. \n\nOne of the guys (25F we\u2019ll call him Aiden) in that group is in a relationship with a girl and she (25F we\u2019ll call her Jessica) hasn\u2019t been as accepting of me. Sometimes Aiden would invite her to hang with the group and she seems very closed off towards me. I\u2019m not too close to Aiden like I am to the rest of the members in the group. However, we do get along and we often talk to each other. Apparently she\u2019s been getting angry whenever we do interact, she\u2019d fake laugh along our conversations, give me dirty looks, slam utensils on the table when we\u2019re all eating together. Friends from the group had informed me of this and found it hilarious, but I\u2019m not amused at all. \n\nSo one day we had a plan to go out of town for sightseeing, only the four of us (Aiden, Jessica, Tori, and me) and the rest of the group were unable to join. Tori contacted me if I could contact Aiden if he could drive us to meet her up at a place out of town(she didn\u2019t want to drive back and forth picking everyone up), also Aiden and I live in the same neighborhood. I didn\u2019t think anything of it and let him know the plans. So when he came by to pick me up in the morning, he\u2019d been alone. Confused, I asked where Jessica was and he told me that she had already been with Tori at the meeting place. Jessica had been back at her parents place the other night which was located near the place we were planning to meet at. So it left with me and Aiden to leave town and meet up with the two girls. So Aiden and I drove to meet the girls and Jessica was pissed off that we were 10 minutes late (due to traffic) and she ignored me for the rest of the day. Eventually, Aiden and Jessica got into an argument and that car ride back was so awkward. \n\nI complained to some of my friends (outside of the group, other girls) about the situation. They told me that I was in the wrong and should\u2019ve just avoided the situation altogether by not going. I knew Jessica disliked me and I disrespected her relationship by entering the car and traveling with Aiden. The fact that I\u2019m new to the group gives the right for Jessica to be upset with me, since I\u2019m just a stranger.

We message on a daily basis, hanging out in discord calls and making fun of each other as that is sort of the nature of our friendships. I say online friends because we live in different countries but I would say that we are as close as any other irl friends. \n\nOne of these friends who I grew particularly close with, we will call her \"J\" for this post.\u00a0 I won't mention age for privacys sake but we are all very close in age.

I am currently waiting in line to order food at my school and she asks what I am going to order. I say I'm getting a pizza and she immediately replies with something along the lines of \"i shouldnt have asked bc now I am going to be hungry\". And due to the nature of our friendship, I tell her that I'll be sure to \"send her pics [of my food] later.\" Obviously, so that she can be jealous and hungry. Because I didn't explicitly say pics \"of my food\", she takes the opportunity to make fun of me and makes an out of context joke by saying how I sounded like some weird creep who would send inappropriate pics online. \n\nOne important detail I'll add is that we joke like this frequently so it wasn't anything uncalled for. She even said explicitly that she was joking while I was typing out my response. \n\nMe, seeing the opportunity to get back at J, turn it around and say \"oh yea, dont worry. Ill send you pics of my. Big. Delicious. Pizza.\" \n\nBy that time, I am at the front of the line and order my pizza. When it's done, I obviously take a picture of the pizza and send it to J, commenting on how beautiful the pizza is. (I am a foodie). She then replied with a message that said: \"hey, I know that serious isnt really our thing but i felt really uncomfortable then.\"\u00a0 \n\nI respond with: \"you started it (the joke).\" \n\nShe responds with: \"yea, but I didnt expect you to continue it and go on about it. I just expected you to say 'excuse me' or something like you usually do.\" \n\nAnd then she says \"Im sorry\" and then says shes going to sleep. \n\nI respond with: \"you know Im never serious ab that kind of stuff and that its a joke\" And then I say good night. \n\nThen she leaves me on read. I thought maybe she just looked at it and saw it as a conversation ended so no reply was needed. I didn't think too much of it then. \n\nHowever, earlier today, I asked if J wanted to join us (me and the group of friends) to play games again and if she was online or not. \n\nLeft me on read again.

I also asked what she\u2019s been up to and how her internship has been or if she started school again. \n\nThis is the first time she never replied and I feel it\u2019s on purpose since she has never once not responded to me or forgotten to. This made me mad and I was venting to my friend, but she said I\u2019m not entitled to a reply. I said even if I\u2019m not entitled to it, I can still find it annoying. My friend thinks I\u2019m reading into it and that it isn\u2019t personal or intentional. I disagreed and said it is on purpose and that she should be straight up. \n\nMy friend keeps countering me saying maybe she just forgot to reply.", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631345548.0, "author_fullname": "bossybaddie", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pm2z3m/aita_for_getting_mad_she_didnt_reply/"}, {"title": "AMITA for getting angry that my boyfriend asked me to block my old flirty unappealing coworker on Facebook?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631345742.0, "author_fullname": "diyliffeee1717", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pm30hj/amita_for_getting_angry_that_my_boyfriend_asked/"}, {"title": "AITA for getting angry that my boyfriend asked me to block my old flirty unappealing coworker on Facebook?", "content": "\n\nMy boyfriend(25) and I (24) have been together for 4 years and are servers at the same restaurant.

Other than the sweaty hugs I pretty much ignored whatever weird shit he said to me until one day him and my boyfriend were at work together and the story I heard was: Bob was going around bragging about how I had boned him the night before, my boyfriend told him to stfu and then Bob wanted to go outside and fight my boyfriend.

(the guest were people that not even their mom would recognize them); also it was supposed to be a charity event for trees and firefighters but there were some problems with that, and the event now has a bad reputation all over social media.\n\nThis uncle LOVES being popular, and knowing people and he basically organizes this events to show how \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201csuccessful\u201d he is, even though he has never worked a day in his life and it\u2019s my dad that supports him.

The first thing you see is this big logos that cover the whole image, the music is irritating and the transitions aren\u2019t that smooth. So I was already iffy about publishing this thing as a \u201cfavor\u201d, when the next day he sends over a new version that was even worse. Somehow he decided that there weren\u2019t enough logos (there is a permanent logo in the corner), and that my cousin (F) needed to be in the video.\n\n (I know, my family is full of narcissists with hollow heads.  Like seriously, BOOKS DONT KILL). \n\nI could deal with the logos, the problem is that the new scenes seem to have been filmed by the first cellphone in history that included a c\u00e1mara. New scenes also mean that the music way of, more than before, and let\u2019s not star with the transitions.\n\nThe business page I manage has a big following &lt;70k, so my uncle decided that it would be perfect if I publish the video!! I decided to be the bigger person and chose the best between the worst and published the first draft, but now the annoying half brain cell of an uncle doesn\u2019t stop asking my dad to ask me to put up the second draft. \n\nMy dad has huge boundaries issues (his family is super toxic), so he thinks I should be the bigger person and do so as to not rock the boat.

My sister in law is my fianc\u00e9's sister to clarify.\n\nI've been with my fianc\u00e9 for 5 years and we've been engaged for two. Before I got with my fianc\u00e9, his family was trying to get him to date another female friend of his who he no longer talks to because she's said some pretty horrible things about him and some of his friends. Plus she was always trying to put me in my place since I started dating my fianc\u00e9, claiming she'll always come first in his life. Long story short, stuff happened and they no longer talk.\n\nI have a pretty close relationship with his family, especially his two siblings, his sister (the bride) and his brother.\n\nOne day before the wedding we were having a family lunch with the brides family and during lunch she started mentioning that female ex friend of my fianc\u00e9. She started saying what a gorgeous girl she is and how pretty she is. My fianc\u00e9 and I felt uncomfortable and my fianc\u00e9 was pretty pissed because that ex friend has caused a lot of damage in my fianc\u00e9's life in the past so it was hurtful for him to hear his sister praising her like that but he stayed silent since he didn't want to cause drama during the wedding period.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was when my SIL said that it's a shame my fianc\u00e9 never got to date (female ex friend) since I came along and took her place because she'd love to have her as a bridesmaid but because of me she can't and she can't even call her a sister because of me. My MIL told her to apologise and tried to do damage control claiming my SIL was joking but SIL said she's not joking, she really feels that way, then proceeded to say she loves me as her new SIL she'd just prefer (female ex friend). I kindly got up and excused myself, saying I'll head home. While I was gathering my stuff to leave I also said I'd withdraw as a bridesmaid since I'm not really the one she wanted there and that she should contact (ex friend) while she still has time and I'll give her my dress since we are the same size. Fianc\u00e9 left with me and while leaving he said something along the lines of \"you never know when to shut your mouth\" to his sister.\n\nMIL justified me walking out, so did my BIL and FIL. They say bride's words were ridiculous, they tried to convince me to stay as a bridesmaid but respected my wish to walk out. My family on the other hand said I'm TA for not sucking it up for one more day and walking away from the role while making the bride stressed.

Both our families live close by, however my family home contains my father's hoarding habits, so my partner goes to his mother's home to do our laundry.\n\nI am disabled. I have trouble doing a lot of household chores and while I do what I can, laundry can be difficult. There is also animals in my MIL's home, which I'm allergic to, so my partner does our laundry. I also can't drive, so on the off chance he can't do it, I don't really have the option to go do it at my parent's home. Therefore, the biggest problem arises when my partner has overtime on the weekend. When that happens, he drops our laundry off at his mother's, and she does it for us.\n\nI was always grateful for this, as I know she's not obligated to do it for us but does it because she wants to help her son. However, there started being a problem when I bought some new clothes. I also have a skin allergy to polyester, so I was starting to replace my clothing with more natural fabrics. Ones that can shrink. I would separate these, and my partner would hang them up and pick them up the next day. But when his mother would do our laundry, she would put them in the dryer anyways. I started noticing my new clothes were shrinking, many becoming unwearable. I told my partner this, and he asked his mom to stop putting those clothes in the dryer.\n\nShe didn't stop. I'd get some new clothes, try them on to see if I needed to return anything, then put them in the wash. So I could always tell when she had shrunk my clothes. I had a lot of panic attacks over it. I didn't want to waste my partner's money, but I was scared to confront her. I couldn't figure out why she was doing it. This happened quite a few times although I can't really pinpoint a number. Maybe at least 6 or 7?\n\nEventually I worked up the nerve to talk to her. She berated me for not helping out enough, said I was being ungrateful to her, said I should buy more expensive clothes so they don't shrink (yet also berated me for buying a slightly expensive pair of shoes because I wanted durable running shoes?) So the whole talk was me crying through a panic attack mostly. She at least said she would no longer touch my clothes at all, which is fine by me, but the way we got there was just a mess. On a side note, she has not said this to my face but told my partner she thinks everything about my disabilities and allergies is a lie. I mean, I wish it were a lie, but it isn't. \n\nI fear I've damaged my reputation with her, not that I had much of one in the first place, but I also think that I am allowed to ask her not to shrink my clothing. We did look into some alternative ways to do laundry but nothing really worked out. I'm frustrated that all this happened and can't make sense of if I did anything wrong.

I say g'day, ask how their days are going, do they need anything from the shops, conversations about movies and the like. But I don't participate in deeper conversations with them and usually stay in my bfs room after the intial greetings until he is home to avoid talking to them.\n\nHis parents and I have different views on pretty much everything. We have almost nothing in common, and it can make conversations with them difficult to have while avoiding a minefield of topics. They're very loud and opinionated people, and if I talk to them for more than a few minutes they will bring one of these topics up.\n\nAnytime any of these topics come up in a group setting, I withdraw from the conversation. At the start, I used to participate, but I feel steamrolled everytime I do. When asked my view,  it's \"I believe this and here is why\". I usually get interrupted by \"no we believe this and you're wrong here's why\". They would just keep getting louder and louder and I would leave the conversation feeling invalidated and steamrolled. So now I don't participate in these with them and I bite my tongue when listening.\n\nThis came to a head yesterday. They had a fire going, and we were all sitting around it. They spent it talking about a lot of these topics, so I spent most of it listening rather than participating.

I'm happy to say that my performance has been excellent and I have received two promotions during this time.\nLately, my workload has changed dramatically. The company has gotten bigger and as a result, as the senior member of my department I was assigned the tasks that come with more responsibility, which wouldn't be a problem normally but this specific tasks are not enjoyable for me. \nI  had been thinking of finding a new job for a few months and I finally decided to let my boss know about 3 weeks ago, but didn't formally resign. Around the same time, we had a new member join our department. \"Kevin\" (M, late 40's) has a ton of experience in the field, but often came off as condescending and bossy. On his very first day he introduced himself as my manager, even though he wasn't. We had incidents were he questioned my decisions in a very aggresive way, and he was also quite rude towards the rest of the team.\nI took this as my sign to finally quit so I sent my resignation letter. That afternoon my phone blew up. Turns out my boss was leaving for Asia soon (actually tomorrow) and was freaking out about not being able to leave since whenever he goes I take charge. \nHe called, texted, even tried to come to my house. HR also started calling and making offers so that I would come back- and this is where everything went wrong.\nHR-  We've had some complaints regarding Kevin, does this have anything to do with you leaving?\nDumb me- I do find it hard to communicate effectively with him, but there were other reasons\nHR- Kevin will be fired, you can come back tomorrow.\nI tried to explain, but the most I got was to get him transferred to another (lesser) position. \nI felt really bad, and pressured to come back because\n1. Boss needed to leave\n2. Someone had been fired because of me\nI went back to work and have been feeling horrible, especially because random people keep talking behind Kevin's back and he has been low-key made fun of. A close coworker claims it's his own fault, as when I quit he tried to put other people down and has become one of the most disliked people on the entire company in a very small time frame.\nNow to the issue at hand. When I quit, I sent my Resume to an amazing company and got an interview. Today I received an offer, it is about 15% more of what I'm making now. \nOf course I cannot leave immediately, but would I be an a** if I asked this company to allow me, say, 4 weeks time to start? \n I feel like I'm being unprofessional by considering leaving, but I also believe I stated many times that I was not interested in coming back and felt very pressured to do so.\nSo, WIBTA if I take this new job after all the drama of the last few weeks?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631255381.0, "author_fullname": "No_Occasion_4114", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/plfkxz/wibta_of_i_quit_after_a_coworker_was_fired/"}, {"title": "WIBTA for moving out because I don't like one of my roommate's partner?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631255399.0, "author_fullname": "haidadej", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/plfl2u/wibta_for_moving_out_because_i_dont_like_one_of/"}, {"title": "WIBTA if I ma****bate on the day of a H*ndu festival?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631255673.0, "author_fullname": "goth_girl21", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/plfn5a/wibta_if_i_mabate_on_the_day_of_a_hndu_festival/"}, {"title": "AITA for wanting to drop someone as a friend", "content": "Am I the asshole for no longer wanting to be friends with a guy. \n\nSo I've been friends with this guy for like a year now and he's becoming increasingly annoying.

I understand that you don't exactly see what's going on behind doors but his brother who I'm relatively close to tells me everything is actually pretty fine, L (the friend in question) has a tendency to overreact, which I know. \n\nHe announced at the beginning of the year that he wanted to move out, which was fine and typical for someone in college. However he took everything as his parents being overbearing and controlling when in all actuality they were helping. They encouraged him to find a job and even showed him various available ones in the area, to which he got ANNOYED because his parents were \"trying to control his life\". \n\nHe then proceeded to take on a full-time job whilst also going to college despite his parents AND myself telling him it was a bad idea. Which no surprise, he had to switch to part-time because he was failing school. He ended up quitting because he didn't account for the college rush and found it to be too stressful. \n\n The final straw was recently when he announced to me that he wanted to take a trip to another state. I asked him if he actually thought this through, not trying to be an asshole but to be helpful considering I have plenty of experience traveling out of state both by myself and with my family. He then proceeded to tell me that he basically had NO plan and announced he wanted to do this ALONE. A thing you should know is the state he wants to go to is a nine hour drive and he has cardiac problems and his plan is to rough it on his own in a park. This state also is common for having bears wander over to the campsites in their national parks and he had not considered the fact that he'd be nine hours away from his family who might be able to help him if something went wrong.\n\nThis isn't the first time L has chosen to be \"independent\" and he often complains about his dad.

He honestly continues to complain about his life to me and gets aggravated when I ask him if he's looked at it from a different angle.

Last night he asked if I'd take her in, I said yeah, and she said \"promise\" and I said, I won't promise because I don't know how happy I'll be to get out of bed early tomorrow. \n\nDriving her in is not a massive inconvenience for me, however on one of the days I had a terrible night's sleep and waking up about two hours earlier than I normally would to drive her in, I felt exhausted all day, and barely got any work done. I work from home in a job that requires me to answer a lot of calls, and do a lot of repetitive tasks. Again, this isn't the most intensive job in the world, certainly not as intensive as teaching, but I find answering phone calls very anxiety enducing, and that with the repetitive nature of the job make me really quite depressed sometimes, things which are worsened if I feel exhausted, which I do very easily. Basically, I find the job virtually impossible if I'm really tired. \n\nToday, I've woken up after another bad night's sleep, and I asked her if she'd either be able to get a bus, or I would pay for a taxi, which would cost about \u00a35, just so I'd be able to get a couple more hours good sleep before I started working, and I explained this to her.\n\nShe got angry, and called me a \"prick\" and a \"cunt\" before she left.  She rang me from the school about 10 minutes later, crying and asking to apologise. I was quite angry at this point because when she insults me like that it genuinely upsets me. I told her that if she thought I was a prick I was going to act like one, and that I wouldn't drive her into school again. I hung up on her after she said that she had stuff to do, and that she couldn't work without us making up. I sighed and said \"Grow up\" and put the phone down.\n\nShe rang again and said (truthfully) that she has OCD, and that it would be a real struggle for her to go through the day whilst we had this unresolved tension, so could we just make up for the time being. I agreed and we got off the phone.\n\nI appreciate that she's got OCD, and planning ahead and sticking to it helps her with this, and in this respect I'm at fault. However, when I know that forcing myself out of bed to take her in would negatively impact my whole day, that's where I draw the line. \n\nI really don't think I've done anything wrong. Is this arrogance? I would have understood her being angry had I offered no alternatives, as by the point I asked her this it would have been too late for her to get the bus.

It all started with Julia, she is a lot different than be, in a good and bad way, one of her most prominent ways to make friends is at parties. It had been a while, so Julia wanted to throw a party, now in some context, I am normally considered a party pooper, I don't like to drink etc. This is not the case with Julia, even though it's illegal in the US. At this same time, Josh had just met Sabrina, they went on a few dates, nothing special, and it was going ok. (Sabrina was not aware they were dates ). It all lined up, there was going to be a big party at Julia's house, and amongst lots of other people, Josh would be bringing Sabrina. Here's where my observation comes in. Everyone gets there, and it starts around eight PM, by ten almost everyone is blackout drunk. I had chosen the path of minding my own business in the corner, as I had not wanted to be there in the first place, but wanted to support my partner. Eventually, I struck up a conversation with James, it was nothing interesting, however, what was happening behind him. I Look over and eavesdrop. I see Josh trying to get Sabrina to drink, MAJOR RED FLAG, he was actively almost forcing it onto her, what a terrible person. It gets worse, Josh in his inebriated, or ignorant brain thought that it would be a good idea to force a kiss out of Sabrina claiming that she had agreed to kiss earlier via text. I don't want to go into details, but it was very physical with him ending up succeeding, I wanted to say something, but I was not about to have my five foot five skinny body face a six-foot-something strong very drunk Josh, who was already doing something unforgivable, and disgusting. Sabrina Leaves shortly after. I tried to leave but Julia would not let me, claiming that this was an ok thing and that she's a girl so she gets it. I did not agree with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all dies off after two months or so, I am still friends with Sabrina and cut ties with Josh, and mostly with Julia, it was complicated.

Some investigating later, and I find out that she never knew about his prior RECENT encounters with arguably S.A. (Later on I found out that he had done stuff like this before) I talked to Sabrina and we thought that it would be a good idea to inform her formally on what happened just so that she can be aware of how to progress in her relationship, the last thing I want to see is for that to happen again.

I took it upon myself (with H\u2019s permission) to post on my social media to see if any of my friends were interested in having her. M saw my post and messaged H and asked if he knew I had posted about the cat. H said of course he knew and he explained we were just trying to make it easy for everyone and handle the situation ourselves so that M did not have to worry about it anymore. \n\nM didn\u2019t like that, and started telling H how awful I am. M said that I should have just built up an immunity to the cat and I should have trained my dogs better and that I am selfish.

We got along well over the last 2 years but never really hung out outside of school due to covid. During our last weeks of school I really helped Betty and Nick with studying and felt really close to them, Betty in particular promised to make plans in summer. Once school did end things already got off to a bad start. First, everyone seemed to be getting summer jobs so said they were too busy to hang out. But then 2 weeks into summer Betty got a new bf and was always hanging out with him, despite saying she didn\u2019t have time for me. I tried to host a small gathering but everyone declined my invitation saying they were too busy. 2 weeks later she had a party with all of us but spent the whole time with her bf inside whilst we were left outside in the cold til 2am. I didn\u2019t have a ride &amp; her brother said I could stay over but then she quickly told me I couldn\u2019t &amp; I had to walk home. Weeks then started going by and she kept ignoring and declining plans, the only person I was still speaking to was Nick. It made me really sad as I felt she never made time for me. The only time she did invite me out was on a double date with her and her bf and Amy and Thomas (dating), making me a fifth wheel &amp; hardly spoke to me the whole time there. A few weeks went by &amp; I was continually being ditched. I then decided to confide in one of my other friends Carrie, about the situation and told her not to tell Betty as she wouldn\u2019t understand my perspective. Literally 2 days go by &amp; Carrie texts me saying \u2018Betty says she hasn\u2019t been ditching you at all\u2019 \u2018do you want to try and make plans with her again\u2019 (they were both out together). At this point I was sick of getting rejected when I make plans and thought if Betty really wanted to she could message me herself so I just told Carrie \u2018I just want to move on from it all now\u2019 (referring to the situation). It pissed me off that Carrie went &amp; told her since I don\u2019t know what was said or in what context. Anyway that brings us to now. I have been crying the last 2 days as I saw all my friend group on holiday together in Betty\u2019s 2nd house &amp; I wasn\u2019t even sent so much as a text. I spoke to Nick last night and apparently they had all made the plans behind my back and Betty was the organiser. Nick said he understood why I was upset &amp; how it hurt me &amp; said he had no idea why I wasn\u2019t invited. This especially hurt me as I told Betty how things like this have happened in the past &amp; how I have trust issues. So I want to call her out now given 2 days to think. I want to know why she didn\u2019t invite me &amp; what she feels I\u2019ve done to her. I feel it\u2019s something to do with Carrie but I\u2019ll leave that to you Reddit.

Does not matter what she buys, as long as she goes shopping. And she does not like shopping alone, not even with her friends, only with me. She has made that abundantly clear. And she likes doing fun stuff(museums, zoos, parks, mini golf, etc. Etc. I have gotten as many memberships to these thibgs as i could, it is way cheaper that way). And she isn't the most healthiest of individuals. And we both work, and we only have one mutual full off day a week together\n\nThat was a lot of random points, i know, but context was needed\n\nSo what i do on that aforementioned off day is, whenever she wants to go shopping on that day, as she almost always does, i suggest hitting up one of those fun things i parenthesesed above, and if we go through it to fast, try another one, and another, until most of the day is gone, or she is looking tired. Then we go shopping. If i ever suggest leaving the store before she is done shopping, she gets real cranky, sometimes mad. But if she is tired, and i suggest going to bed, or better yet, she says it is time to go, she is happy. She loves these days, we spend so much time together with our kids at so much fun places, and do not get me wrong, i love these days too.\n\nAnd one more thing, the main reason i do all this is not to prevent her from shopping. She still spends that money, but what i do allows her to spend that money on a big ticket item, which makes her real happy. Big ticket as in a new couch, appliance, giant kids toy, or something.

My best friend offered to help us financially for the meantime while we\u2019re still looking for a job. \n\nFast forward to where we are right now, we are both employed, very happy with the pay, and yes the debt has also been fully paid. The thing is, he has a new girlfriend. They\u2019ve been going it for months now. She used to stay in another city because that\u2019s where she worked before and my best friend would travel and go sleep over at her place every weekend. Now, the girlfriend decides to quit her job there and try to look for a job here so they could be near each other. \n\nTechnically, my best friend offered to let her stay in our place while she was looking for a job. And no, my best friend didn\u2019t ask us if it was okay with us for her to stay (The 3 of us are living together). So me and my boyfriend just let it slide and we\u2019re thinking \u201cWe\u2019ll just suck it up. It\u2019s only temporary.\u201d I asked my best friend why wouldn\u2019t they just move in together and he said it\u2019s too early. \n\nFast forward, the girlfriend is now employed and has a new place- with her friend. Here\u2019s the thing, we thought it was only for that time that she\u2019ll be staying here but we thought wrong. She\u2019s here almost every weekend, sleeping over. And it annoys the hell out of us. \n\nFirst off, she\u2019s not paying rent (and no, she did not pay even a cent for our expenses when she stayed here for a month). Second, she uses our supplies like she comes here and does her laundry. I mean we paid for it and she\u2019s just using it for free like our budget is only allotted for the 3 of us smh. \n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to say anything and he doesn\u2019t want me too either. But should I though? I mean, yes, I understand that he helped us and all that but like\u2026.. Idk. The girlfriend\u2019s practically a free loader every week.

Not that she knew but I was dealing with mental health issues at the time and this really affected me.\n\nEmma has also attempted to control a friends life. One of our friends recently turned 18 and it\u2019s tradition that when you graduate you get drunk at a really big party we call \u201cleavers\u201d. We are all graduating in a few months and plan on completely this party tradition, however, Emma told my friend \u201cyou can\u2019t drink at leavers\u201d. When my friend asked why she said \u201cbecause it\u2019s a non-alcoholic event\u201d, which is true, however, in my country the legal age to drink IS 18 and Emma is 17. It is completely legal to drink at Leavers if you are the legal age. This is her most recent controlling act.\n\nA few years ago when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer (she is okay now btw), I informed Emma who was my closest friend at the time. When I told her she immediately said \u201cit\u2019s okay I understand how you feel, I felt the same when my grandfather died\u201d, which would not make me mad if she was trying to relate her feelings to mine, except, her grandfather died when she was 1. I don\u2019t like to doubt things people say but I doubt she even remembers it. When I came to school a few days later she suggested I use my mother\u2019s cancer as an excuse to sleepover at her house. Obviously I declined and was quite disgusted she would suggest that, but again I didn\u2019t confront her. \n\nOverall, our friend group has had conversations and we all agreed we didn\u2019t want to be friends with her anymore.

I still am very aware these are not my cats, but since I provide 90% of their care the line is a bit blurry.\n\nI used to feed them by putting out two bowls of cat food and leaving them but noticed that one cat was getting a bit chunky. So I started measuring them out more carefully, eventually, lockdown lifted and I was able to get a week away. H overfilled both bowls so they were literally overflowing and the big cat got noticeably heavier. I had explained before I left that the cat was getting a bit fat and he needed to avoid over-feeding. \n\nI changed the cat's diet back and noticed some but not much progress with its weight. After a second trip away and a bit of research, I realised I should separate them for feeding and for about 2-3 weeks did this. There was some real progress one cat gained a bit of weight the other lost some. I then went away again. Leaving clear instructions on how to feed them.\n\nI came back to the cat's bowls so full they were overflowing again. It took me about a week to train them to eat their 2x a day meals in one sitting so I'm a bit frustrated that the habit has been broken. Not to mention ALL the progress with the chunky cat has been undone. So I figured I'd sort them back out this morning and reminded H that they only needed x amount of food per day, to separate them and not leave leftover food out once they were reunited. Came downstairs and both food bowls were massively overfull. I once again reminded H and showed him how much they were supposed to eat. \n\nI will admit that I'm overprotective of the cats. I love them dearly and again pretty much did all their early socialisation. In the evenings the chunky boy sits with me, and I'm very much his fave human. So I feel obligated to look out for him not getting diabetes, since it's my fault he got a bit big, to begin with.\n\nHe isn't thrilled about the nagging ( he is bad at portion control with the humans too so I cook all the meals normally) we haven't argued over it but I think he's about to lose patience with me. The cats are registered under my name at the vet and so I have to go with him to change that at their next appointment and I know they are going to say everything I've been saying for weeks in regards to chunks weight.

Not a throwaway as the stakes are pretty low, but I'd like other opinions before I act (or not)\n\n\nI've lived next to my neighbour for over 15 years. We get along really well. He's been very helpful over the years as he's a painter/decorator/handy man who has kept his prices very reasonable for me. Our houses are old UK terraces so we hear everything (eg he sneezes &amp; I shout bless you!) We both enjoy music, have kids etc so we both make noise the other can hear. We've never complained about each other or had any problems. We both know we can ask the other to tone it down with no issue, we're both considerate of the time we're noisy although he goes much later than me. \n\n\nWe've both always had dogs. His first ones were outside. They were super well trained, never made noise. My two are indoors. One is quiet but the other is a rescue street dog from Romania. We bought her here 8 years ago. She's trained to a degree but is still wild at heart. She barks, mainly to 'talk' to people but also at door knocks &amp; squirrels. I'm housebound so always in. I shut her up immediately, usually after 1 bark. She is quiet at night. I realise this isn't ideal &amp; bugs my neighbour no doubt. I have spent a lot of time/money/effort on training to undo her bad habits, but she'll occasionally slip &amp; do 1 bark before I can shush her. It's maybe 5 times a day, from 8am - around 5pm. Neighbour has commented over the years &amp; I assured him I'm always working on it. He's not at all angry but implies his 'pure breed' dogs are better &amp; he's a better owner 'cos they're quiet. He has no experience of rescues, let alone street dogs. Also he had these pups from 8 weeks, ours were adopted as adults so there will be a difference. \n\n\nCurrent problem : His outdoor dogs passed away &amp; he got another about 6 months ago.

He won't take it well coming from me (a not man) &amp; considering my dog is a barker too, I worry that it makes me a total asshole for even bringing his dog's barking up. I feel like it'd be more trouble than it's worth ultimately. I guess I could do it in a nice way, like buy the pup a Kong &amp; mention it might help him not be bored &amp; bark.. but I know he'd probably take it the wrong way. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for even thinking about bringing it up considering my dog?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631268101.0, "author_fullname": "randomnamekitsune", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pli0un/wibta_if_i_complained_about_a_dog_possibly/"}, {"title": "Straight, asking if I\u2019m wrong", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631268160.0, "author_fullname": "Healthy_Display5650", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pli1ac/straight_asking_if_im_wrong/"}, {"title": "(Meta) The toxicity of this sub", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631268229.0, "author_fullname": "Xathrall", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pli1tn/meta_the_toxicity_of_this_sub/"}, {"title": "WIBTA for refusing to submit a video of myself as part of my job application?", "content": "TL;DR jumped through hoops as part of job application but I draw the line at making a film of myself.

It would simply be a catastrophe to mix both family\u2019s, on one side we have my family all smokers, all heavy drinkers, all loud, I mean you get the picture and on the other side we have his family, no one smokes, go to church every Sunday, don\u2019t drink. It sounds like the bad plot of a movie waiting to happen so we just thought let\u2019s avoid it completely. \nEveryone was on board, it really simplified things for a lot of people as well. We agreed that my parents would pay for the France wedding and his parents would take care of the Korea wedding. Weddings in Korea and weddings in France tend to be very different, in Korea it\u2019s just a quick ceremony you eat there and then everyone goes home, usually around a 4 hour thing. In France however in can be a whole weekend event for some people, usually you change locations a few times, and the night ends with a huge party and breakfast the next day. \nWe agreed it would be best to have the wedding in France first since I\u2019m an only child and my mom would probably have a heart attack if she missed her only child\u2019s official wedding. His parents aren\u2019t really bothered by it because they have 6 children and it\u2019ll basically only be a reception.\nFast forward a few months, we send out the invitations for both weddings and my mother calls me curious why she only received one invitation. I was quite confused because we had already talked about this and she was completely on board . She tells me she thought I was joking about her not attending the wedding in Korea. This leads to a huge argument between us where I end up telling her mom I will not have you embarrass me in front of his whole family. She has already ruined so many big moments for me, like getting drunk and throwing up at my college graduation, crying at my engagement because my ring was bigger than hers and the list goes on. \nMy father tried to talk to her but she\u2019s livid saying that I\u2019m being a bad daughter. My father told me not to listen to her tantrum and that she\u2019ll get over it in time for the wedding. \nAITA for not inviting her to the second wedding ?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631171193.0, "author_fullname": "123sweetbutpsycho", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pksrf2/aita_for_not_inviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding/"}, {"title": "AITA for leaving early. ?", "content": "I left a memorial early\n\na long lifetime friend recently passed away.

She only laughed, asking me whom of us my father would believe and held another rant. She wished me \"a good rest of my life\" and told me she \"loved me, but I did not enough\" and hung up.

Without going in to detail, we found out she had been spreading truly vicious rumours about her and having her excluded from things for months. When we found out we cut her off completely. Unfortunately some people have believed the rumours and she\u2019s lost close friends as a result.\n\nIt had a horrific affect on her mental health and self esteem.

She\u2019s always wanted a Chanel bag, but felt it was a ridiculous expense. I asked a bunch of friends if they\u2019d like to club together to get it for her as a surprise. Tons said yes and I was excited to get it for her.\n\nFast forward a couple months and one of the \u201cfriends\u201d called me up to say he thought it was inappropriate of me to be organising it as lots of our friends were having a shit time (true - everyone was - it was lockdown!), and we shouldn\u2019t be solely focusing on my wife as it might make them feel worse/ uncared for.

But plenty of others did and she was thrilled with her gift. \n\nEver since, that guy has been pretty rude to us and excluded us from group stuff.

She is a Christian Instagram influencer and has a large platform. When we were first started dating, his sister was so excited and would text me to start conversation. 6 months later, I found out I was pregnant and she was one of the first ppl we told. She was very supportive and would check on me throughout the pregnancy. But things changed once we got engaged during my pregnancy\u2026.\n\nShe stopped reaching out. Stopped checking on me and even after the birth, she didn\u2019t even ask how I was doing but asked her brother. It was so weird that she stopped reaching out. So now the extent of our relationship is on social media and she only comments when I post my daughter or something about my husband. She follows my friend and literally tells her how pretty she is and comments on most of her posts.\n\nAnyways, a few weekends ago, we attended my husband\u2019s grandmother\u2019s funeral and my SIL came to town. I walked in the house and she barely said hey to me. We approached one of her daughters to say hello and my SIL tells her daughter to \u201cSay hi to Uncle ____ and give him a hug\u201d and didn\u2019t address me. Thought that was weird but she literally didn\u2019t talk to me the whole time. I told my husband about the interaction (he wasn\u2019t paying attention) and he was in denial. He didn\u2019t believe his sister would treat me like that because she\u2019s nice to everyone. Well, next day she did the same thing when we were leaving. She only told her daughters to say bye to my husband and my daughter. I left feeling so confused because I wasn\u2019t sure what I did to her to deserve that. It gets worse. The next day was my birthday and she makes a post on social media saying how amazing I am and how much she loves me and she celebrates my life\u2026. This REALLY confused me because she didn\u2019t say a word to me the whole weekend and disregarded my presence. \n\nI was hurt and disappointed because I really admire her but she\u2019s completely different than what she portrays herself to be on social media.

I won't lie, my Ex and I got into a couple of arguments over her, but I've never been the type to make anyone choose, so I always left her with the freedom to make her own choices, and she always decided to never stop talking to N.\n\nMy Ex and I broke up but continued to see each other and talk (you know, lesbians.) One day the subject of N was brought up again, I finally snapped and broke down in tears, saying how hurtful it was that she always kept deciding to keep talking to her, even though during our relationship my Ex had forced me to stop talking to my friends because she was convinced they had feelings for me, even though nothing had ever happened between me or my friends.

It hit me that my Ex had never explicitly told me whether or not N's husband knew, so during a phone call a couple of hours later, where we were already once again arguing about N, I decided to ask. She was quiet for a moment and then said No. I told my Ex I was going to tell N's husband because he had a right to know. She started freaking out and told me not to do it, but I just hung up on her.\n\nI was quickly able to find his Facebook, where I sent him a message saying that my Ex and N had hooked up in the past, and I thought he deserved to know. My Ex called me back demanding to know if I had done it. When I told her I did, she flipped out, saying what I did was wrong, that I don't even know them, that I don't even know their marriage, and was possibly going to cause a huge fight between them.

I have an apartment of my own, but I spend every weekend with my BF so I see him, Mike, and Jess all the time.\n\nI put in a request for the weekend off to see family almost two months in advance. Last week Jess put in a request for the same weekend off and it was denied because I asked first and in two months three people quit so we're short-staffed. A few days ago Jess found out that she was denied her request off and was upset about it and said to me \"If I don't get this weekend off, I'm quitting.\" to which I thought \"and go where?\" Her and Mike can't afford to not be working with a baby on the way.

Later my boss (who is aware of me and Jess' connection to each other) called me and another manager to tell us that Jess had Covid and wouldn't be coming in. I had a feeling that she was lying. She's also not liked at work and my other coworkers suspected that she was lying too. But there's no proof until I texted my BF telling him to be careful because she said she had Covid. He replied she was lying and wanted the weekend off to do her thing. I tell the other manager about it and he calls our boss. I then got a text from my BF asking me not to say anything because Jess is massively overdramatic, would take her anger out on him because she'd know he told me, and might get fired. I didn't know how to tell him that it's too late so we're are arguing that as a manager myself I have a responsibility to my boss/coworkers/employees to tell them the truth. I also feel really horrible that my BF is going to feel the backlash and there's the possibility that Jess will lose her job, which she can't afforded to.

Apparently this wasn't part of the estate and he already has these assets in his bank account, although i do not know if they are locked until he is 18. I did not receive any of this money because my father only put my little brother as inheritor on his pension papers.\n\nHere is where i might be the asshole, i think i have just as much a right to the money as my little brother is if not more. My father has previously stolen money from me, he emptied the savings account my family had made for me when i was a kid so that when i became 18 i had nothing. Beyond that i think it is incredibly rude that my little brothers mom didn't even offer me half of the money, instead just assuming i would be satisfied with nothing, even tho i am the one who has suffered under my father the longest.\n\nNow i am wondering whether or not i should ask them for the money or not, so reddit WIBTA if i asked for it?", "verdict": "Asshole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631175277.0, "author_fullname": "thedemonlelouch", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pktkra/wibta_if_i_asked_my_brother_for_half_of_his/"}, {"title": "AITA for messaging a guy asking why he banned me from his stream?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631175345.0, "author_fullname": "jenovadeathspecimen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pktl9a/aita_for_messaging_a_guy_asking_why_he_banned_me/"}, {"title": "WIBTA for standing up for my coworker.", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631175401.0, "author_fullname": "myhappyspace", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pktlm6/wibta_for_standing_up_for_my_coworker/"}, {"title": "AITA for baptizing my baby against my husbands wishes?", "content": "My (34F) husband (37M) and I are both catholic, and I wanted to baptize my baby, and our pastor recommended we do.

I, admittedly, am sensitive to smells, whereas he has a deviated septum and does not smell well. So I often smell his natural body odor, which is a sour aroma, when he is unaware. This smell develops during the day even if he isn't really doing strenuous, physical activity. I ask him to shower 1-2 times a day. Once a day, preferably at night, if he isn't working out and it is not hot, because I don't want the stink getting up in our bed. Frankly, I think it's gross, and don't want to be around the smell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis argument is that he showers 6 times a week and that should be enough and that is good. For some people, I am sure that is fine, but like I said, his natural body odor is very unpleasant. I personally shower 1-2 times a day myself depending on the weather (if it is really hot and humid) and my activity level. I am not asking anything of him that I am not already doing myself. I do get frustrated and sometimes yell about it (I do have a naturally loud voice anyways), telling him to shower. He says maybe it would go over better if I approached it differently. However, I initially approached this situation nicely, explaining to him the situation, but now I'm just tired of feeling like I have to beg an adult to clean themselves, or at least use a warm, damp washcloth and soap. As a side note, if this matters, I also have autism (this might have to do with why my sense of smell is so keen as well). I do tend to be very blunt, which I am aware of, but I genuinely don't understand how much nicer I could be about this, or why I should even have to dance around his feelings for something I view as so basic and simple to fix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also think he should change his underwear about twice a day. One pair during the day, and one pair at night. His natural odor can cause the gooch to get a kind of stinky smell, sorry if this is TMI. I am not a clean-freak sort of person, I just prioritize personal hygiene. Before having sex we both have to shower and wash with unscented soap, and typically do afterwards as well. I have had chronic UTIs since I was 10, and like to reduce the risk of any more UTIs by doing this since I am already so prone to them. The unscented soap is especially important because I'm not trying to throw my pH balance off and a lot of the added fragrances just aren't good for you and the rest of your body anyways. I don't expect him to smell like freaking wildflowers and sunshine, just clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to add that this is not that only problem of hygiene we have had in our relationship. He used to pee standing up, which causes urine spray around the toilet, even if your aim in impeccable. It got to the point I had a breakdown crying over cleaning up literal pee on the bathroom floor, and when he finally saw the pee spray under light, he understood and started to sit down and pee.

I\u2019ve been meeting new people and making more firings than I very did in high school. College has been a very nice fresh start. \n\nMy old friend, I\u2019ll call him James, was one of my best friends from 6th grade through graduation. We had similar senses of humor and got along mostly well the entirety of school. He chose to go to a different university than me and he has not been enjoying it. He mentioned that he has applied to my school in order to transfer. \n\nThis really pissed me off. I don\u2019t want this to sound like I have a victim complex, but I was always the #2 in our relationship. He was taller, better looking, and infinitely better in social situations. I often didn\u2019t have a ton of confidence and while he didn\u2019t take advantage of it per day, it definitely felt like there was a dynamic at play where he was #1. He would often tell me about all the problems he had, problems I wish I could\u2019ve had as a shy little introvert. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he was a supportive friend, I just always felt like he was better than me. \n\nI was also a bad friend too, though. James often had an in your face personality and I think people really stopped wanting to deal with him towards the end of high school, me included. I would occasionally distance myself from him when I felt as though he was becoming too annoying and in-my-face. I admit I was shitty for this and we have reconciled and talked this out. \n\nMy issues with him coming to university come from a prior experience with a summer camp which I went to on my own and eventually told James about. It went from my home away from home to the \u201cJames show\u201d in a summer. He was far better socially equipped to handle the social sphere at camp and I felt myself going into his shadow in what had previously been a place I felt was my own. \n\nOur relationship is far more complex than I make it out to be but in all honesty I can\u2019t have another space that I feel is my own invaded. I\u2019m trying to be a new person and I\u2019m having a lot of fun and I don\u2019t want to be dragged right back into James\u2019s shadow. But we are friends.

I dont believe that it will impact his schooling because he transferred into this school 3 months into the school year last year and passed all his classes with 95-100's. He loves disney and has not been there in about 4 years and works really hard and is very understanding of why we havent been able to go. \n\nI dont know when the next time i would be able to take him or if i would be able to take him again in the coming future. Because a lot of factors that are allowing me to go will expire in the coming months and im not sure if i can get them again. I would totally understand if he had just went and i wanted another trip or that he did a bunch of things during the summer and this was just one more thing on top of it. \n\nWhile i understand the reasoning of not wanting to miss a day of school i also feel like the experience would benefit him more than hurt him. \n\nWould i be the asshole if i took him anyway and he missed one day of school ?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1631085130.0, "author_fullname": "wreckitchristoph", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pk5la8/wibta_for_having_my_son_miss_one_day_of_school_to/"}, {"title": "My [28F] friend [29M] is seriously depressed and I\u2019m giving him the silent treatment.

Shortly after, though, she found out her younger brother was allergic to it. So she reached out to me and asked if I (M17) could adopt it or something. At first I was a bit reluctant since we have a small dog and maybe my sister (F22) wouldn't allow it. I've also been feeling a lot more irritable and depressed lately and thought that I probably wouldn't be able to take care of another pet if I could barely even take care of myself. I asked my sister later and she said yes. In fact, she was super into it. She was already really excited about it even before she could pick the bunny up.\n\nEventually, though, my friend told me never mind, her dad wanted to keep the bunny since they really liked it. My sister was disappointed at this. Instead, she asked me to babysit her for a week or two. Since my friend's brother is allergic, they decided to just buy a cage, it wouldn't arrive for a while, they're just getting one delivered from online.\n\nSo eventually, my sister picks up the bunny, and she's really happy, and taking pictures of her, posting it on socmed. The first thing I found weird was that she renamed the bunny. We are only babysitting her. My friend named her Cinnamon, but my sister decided to rename her Kimchi. She refuses to call her anything else, and used Kimchi in the caption of her posts. I don't know if she got permission from my friend to rename her.\n\nMy sister fed her and stuff on the first day, but got mad when she found out that bunnies have super fast metabolism and shits almost directly after they eat. Cinnamon pooped a lot around the living room since that's where we fed her. I read somewhere that rabbit poop was clean so I just picked her poop up, threw it outside, and washed my hands. My sister yelled at me for handling poop like that so I told her to shut up. Yet, she refuses to clean it up herself. I'm gonna be honest, when we first got our dog and she hadn't been trained to poop outside yet, she always made me clean it up. She's never done it herself as far as I know.\n\nThe day after we got Cinnamon, I woke up at around 2 pm since I was really tired and had to sleep at 8 am that day for personal reasons. While I was waking up, I overheard my sister say \"Kimchi ate pork lol\" to one of my cousins who was in the room, so I shot up and panicked. I ran to the living room and saw Cinnamon with my other cousins who told me that yeah, she ate from my dog's plate earlier. I went back to the room and yelled at my sister for letting her eat meat, to which she just dismissed, and told me I was overreacting.\u00a0\n\nI don't like getting angry, nor do I get angry often, so now I'm feeling a bit guilty over getting mad over my sister not taking care of Cinnamon.

No fight, we all just got busy and went from dinner 3-4/wk to not really talking anymore.  Their son is 19 now and roughly 4 years before Jane had her him, she beat colon cancer &amp; was in remission. She was told she'd never be able to have children. So her son is their miracle baby \n\nJohn is also my attorney. Several months ago I had to call him around 6:00pm to come rescue me because I was being detained for nonsense. He came to get me and got everything dropped. Later I emailed him to send me a bill.  Around 9:30pm that same day, he replied with \"can I call you now about Jane\". He knows I wake up at 4:30am so it was a bit strange that he wanted to talk that late.\n\nHe calls me and says Jane's cancer is back but has metastasized to other parts of her body. She's doing chemo and radiation, but hasn't been getting good results so far. She's severely depressed &amp; completely withdrawn from everything &amp; everyone. She only leaves the house for doctors appts/treatments and doesn't really speak to anyone anymore. When he got home from rescuing me, he told Jane about it &amp; her face lit up when he mentioned me.

While we were talking, her cancer diagnosis came up and this time it's worse. She just can't muster the strength or energy to go out anywhere or let anyone see her like this.\n\nShe then told that she will NOT tell her son about her diagnosis. Her argument is that she wants him to fully enjoy his college experience and that she refuses to ruin it by telling him she's sick. She believes that her son will feel obligated to drop out of school to come home. John is a wonderful husband and has/will hire all the help she needs (FT housekeeper, cook, nurses, etc), so her son doesn't \"need\" to come home to take care of her.\n\nOver the last several months she has been getting worse. Her doctors still have hope that she can beat this again, but there is always the chance that she won't. On the chance that she doesn't beat it, he'll feel horrible remorse for not being there for her and anger for not being told...

These circumstances (which are legal reasons that do not involve seeking asylum or escaping persecution) also prevent the parents of the bride from returning to country A.\n\nIn our culture, the bride has a large say on where the wedding will happen. She has insisted that the wedding should happen in country B. The groom's family has tried to convince her to have it in country A instead. Because the bride's parents cannot return to country A, she has insisted that the wedding push through in country B (my friend suspects that the groom's family does not know that the bride's parents cannot return to country A).\n\nWith the current state of the world, this is obviously a terrible decision. The entire family of the groom need to fly to attend the wedding. This includes his grandparents and his father who has diabetes (so they will be at greater risk if they contract COVID). On the bride\u2019s side, only the grandparents are flying (they are 80+ years old and immunocompromised). \n\nCountry B has declared that only foreign nationals that were injected with vaccines from their accepted vaccine list would be allowed to enter the country.

It was around 9 PM already and I didn\u2019t wanna pester him constantly about confirming the receipt so I just went to sleep.\n\nDay 7, I wake up to find that he never messaged back.

At this point my head is starting to boil, so I sent him a message in the morning asking if he was able to do what he said he would.\n\n5 hours later I still got no response and at this point I blew up.

Tom suggested I moved in with him while i look for a job in the main city with more job opportunities. Me and parents agreed it was a good idea and I moved in. \n\nI stayed there for 4 months while I gather enough money to get my own place. While there, I sensed that Tina is not very fond of me and I could understand why, but Tom insisted that it was HIS apartment so he could invite anyone to stay with him furthermore, he said I wasnt 'anyone' as I was basically his family. They even had multiple fights which I overheard that were about me.\n\n4 months later I moved out but still continued to hang out with Tom during my free time. 3 months later Tom told me that Tina had dumped him. I comforted him, let him cry on my shoulders and helped him just like how he helped me when I was down. A few days later, Tina drunkenly called me and started grilling me about how I am a bitch that wants Tom all to myself and that I'm a horrible person etc. I reminded her that it was her that dumped Tom and not the other way around. After a few back and forth of yelling at each other she hung up, and I blocked her.\n\nAfter Tom had graduated from college, we were celebrating at our home town with our friends and family. Both our mothers pulled us aside and expressed their concern for both of us and they wanted us to get together. We decided to give it a try and started going on romantic dates. It was only after that we fell in love. Being in love with him was so easy and everything came so naturally between the both of us. It wasn't even 6 months later we got married, with only close friends and family by our sides. We've been married 5 years now.\n\nA few months ago, while on a date we ran into Tina. She came up to us and made a snide comment that I   got everything I wanted and that I stole Tom from her and that she hopes I cherish the time i have with him because one day another girl was gonna come steal him from me like I did to her. We were so dumbfunded we didnt know what to do and just watched her walk away.\n\nI'm now thinking that maybe I was the asshole after all?

I'm living currently in the countryside and don't have a driver license, so the paths were a bit limited.\n\nMy dad decided to join me starting in May, and we started walking together. Since he was able to drive, we were able to go further, chatting along, walking long distances with landscapes I couldn't see alone. He doesn't have the motivation to walk alone, unlike I, so having me around was enough for him to get moving.\n\nEverything was going great, but slowly, I felt like he was appropriating this exercice time from me. He bought walking canes so we could walk faster to burn more calories. So far so good. But then, he started to want us to walk longer distance, around 10 kilometers (6 miles), which I had trouble following and let me exhausted at the end. But what really started to piss me off was that he refused to change the path, since it's his favorite one. I'd would say that since the start of August, it's been the same place everyday. Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely place, but I was getting sick and tired of seeing the same thing everyday. And he would got pissed off everytime I asked if we could walk somewhere else.\n\nYesterday, after our walking session, I asked again to walk a different place. He started to get defensive again, saying other places has mosquitos in it and this one was the best. I regret it a bit now, but I then told him that he could do some efforts, since I can walk alone and he can't. Now that I think about it, it was pretty mean and manipulative of me.   \nBut then, he started yelling, telling me how natsy I've been all morning (I was not, everything was good until then), how if I walked alone I couldn't go far and burn enough calories for me to loose weight... I ended up saying I would walk alone then. I can't go as far maybe, but at least I would feel free to walk at my pace again.\n\nHe's been giving me the silent treatment since then, and this morning he didn't go walking, I saw him going straight to his room.\n\ntl;dr: My dad started tagging along me walking, and ended up taking me on the same place everyday, and we got into an argument about it. \n\nAITA for telling my father I want to walk alone now ?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631093889.0, "author_fullname": "Starrysunshine16", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pk78jj/aita_for_telling_my_father_i_dont_want_to_walk/"}, {"title": "Am I the asshole for snapping at my sister?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1631094020.0, "author_fullname": "Bethany_M_H2002", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pk79gv/am_i_the_asshole_for_snapping_at_my_sister/"}, {"title": "AITA- Rules of selling", "content": "My sister reached out to my wanting to sell her high end printer.

We only recently decided to start sleeping with each other again (August 2021) after she broke up with her most recent boyfriend , as she and I both realised our compatibility while they were together. \n\nIn the interim before FWB and I began sleeping together again , I asked and she told me that she has slept with another 2 people as well as myself . At the time , she informed me that she was clean and had been tested for STIs. I understood this , and shared with her that the last person I had slept with was in June , and her and I both were clean , got tested afterwards and used protection. \n\nWith all this understood , I began sleeping with FWB again . Perhaps foolishly , we chose not to use protection as we both prefer sex without . We both understood the risks of this , yet went ahead with it anyway.\n\nOnly yesterday did I notice something wrong with my genitals , and decided to visit the doctor . The symptoms I\u2019m experiencing are similar to the last time I contracted an STI , from an ex-partner who had cheated on me and then passed on the STI to me . With this information , I informed the doctor and am waiting for results back from a urine and blood test.\n\nAfter seeing the doctor , I messaged FWB about the situation , and she understandably panicked . She asked me for my sexual history , and I told her about my previous from June . When I asked for hers and whether she had used protection with whoever she\u2019d been with , she told me I was being \u201cinvasive\u201d . \n\nI was taken aback by this , and asked her why she said that . She said it was uncomfortable I was asking her such personal questions . I said that I was simply asking what the doctor had informed me to ask of her and any other sexual partners I\u2019ve had over the last 6 months. \n\nShe then proceeded to tell me that she had actually slept with 3 guys , not 2 , and all 3 were without protection . She also informed me that she hasn\u2019t had a sexual health check for around 2 years . \n\nI asked her why she was dishonest/withheld that information from me , and she told me that it was her right to privacy and I should stop being a \u201cdick\u201d about the situation. She also asked me to stop \u201clecturing\u201d her on sexual health , and it was her right to choose if she wanted to get checked and when. \n\nI believe that I should have a right to know , should the tests return positive , about where I may have contracted this STI from . I also believe it shouldn\u2019t be considered lecturing to tell her she should probably get a sexual health check if she chooses to sleep with people without protection .

He still lives with his parents and him and his dad get into fist fights. He has been respectful when he\u2019s over: cleans up after himself, and pretty much chills in her room mostly. He isn\u2019t the nicest to her, but I have stayed out of that since it isn\u2019t my business. However there\u2019s a couple of things that irked me to say the least:\n\n1) He bought a shot gun and my roommate asked if he could keep it here since he couldn\u2019t keep it at home. She said that we would be safer with a gun since neither of us have muscle, and are pretty much fucked if someone breaks in. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with a gun being in the house and didn\u2019t know why she would be, since we are both very far left in our views on subjects like firearms: there is more danger with a gun than without. She respected my position, said she would make sure he didn\u2019t keep it here, and it hasn\u2019t been brought up since. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I had just gotten back from vacation and needed to grab something from my roommate\u2019s room when she wasn\u2019t home. I wasn\u2019t snooping through anything in her room. Both of us are cool with each other going into our rooms if there is something we need (ex. getting dishes from out of the other\u2019s room before running the dishwasher). The case to her boyfriend\u2019s gun was laying out in the open on her floor, I don\u2019t know where the gun was and I didn\u2019t go looking for it.\n\n2) He is a recovering drug addict who has had a couple relapses, which doesn\u2019t bother me: we all make mistakes. My roommate and her BF got into a fight, and his response was to lock himself in her bathroom (we have separate bathrooms) and snort lines. I wasn\u2019t cool with this and I voiced this to her. I don\u2019t want any hard drugs in our house and neither does she. He has also come to our house high multiple times, which pisses me off and scares my roommate. I feel like he\u2019s disrespected our home and both of us.\n\n3) I hate that he\u2019s always here, especially when we aren\u2019t home. My roommate sometimes gives him a spare key to lock and unlock the door if neither of us are home. Before he comes over my roommate usually says \u201cI don\u2019t think he is going to stay the night,\u201d he usually does. This also happened tonight. If my boyfriend stays the night ( only 2-3 times per week) he leaves soon after I do in the morning and is never in our house if neither of us are home. I know that my roommate\u2019s BF\u2019s home life isn\u2019t the best, but at the end of the day, I didn\u2019t sign a lease with him, and sometimes I just don\u2019t want anyone over. I\u2019m also not comfortable with ANYONE being at our house if neither of us are home.\n\nSo, AITA?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630997221.0, "author_fullname": "Excellent_Butterfly6", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pjhpu1/aita_for_not_wanting_my_roommates_boyfriend_over/"}, {"title": "Am i the asshole gas station edition", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630997310.0, "author_fullname": "smalltown307", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pjhqhs/am_i_the_asshole_gas_station_edition/"}, {"title": "AITA for give my sister\u00b4s dog?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630997326.0, "author_fullname": "Monadoboi6a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pjhqm7/aita_for_give_my_sisters_dog/"}, {"title": "AITA for refusing to give my moms engagement ring to my step-brother because he\u2019s not \u201cfamily\u201d?", "content": "My mom died when I (27M) was 9. My dad got married sometime after. His wife had 3 other kids so it was definitely a major adjustment. Me and her son \u201cB\u201d (28M) shared my tiny cramped room all our teen years and it was rough. We didn\u2019t get along at all. It was a relief moving out when I started uni and never looked back. The only person I stayed in contact with was my dad and my older brother  (35m)Our relationship with our dad is a bit strained for many other reasons aside from how he handled everything back then. I\u2019ve seen them a handful of times over the years. Last time was at my dad\u2019s for his birthday over a month ago. I was told B has a girlfriend that he\u2019s been with for 5 years and he wants to propose. My dad says it would be a beautiful gift if I gave him my mom\u2019s engagement that she specifically left to us. It was my grandma\u2019s ring which was given to my dad when he wanted to propose to her. That\u2019s a thing my family\u2019s done and so that why he\u2019d think it would be a nice thing to continue on since now he\u2019s ready to get married.\n\nI told them both no. Not just because B isn\u2019t one of my mom\u2019s kids but I want to keep the engagement ring to propose to a future girlfriend. My brother doesn\u2019t believe in getting married so that\u2019s why the ring was passed to me. It was always meant to be used by one of us. I gave these reasons along with that fact it\u2019s part of a family tradition on my moms side. B got pretty mad and so did my dad because he says B is my brother therefore part of the family (and the tradition). I said no he\u2019s not. He\u2019s someone I had to be roommates with tax a teenager but we\u2019re not family. The story would be different if it was my brother who wanted to use it because we\u2019re actually family, my brother agreed with that too. \n\nMy dad hasn\u2019t left me alone about it. B\u2019s only bothered me a few times about it and so has my dad\u2019s wife. Basically think I\u2019m being an asshole since this would be a meaningful gift as a way for me to finally consider him my family and it\u2019s a nice tradition for the new generation. And it\u2019s not like B is short on money to buy his own engagement ring. Seems to be they really wanna push this because it\u2019s part of the tradition on my mom\u2019s side.

This previous week someone had left a pen in the dryer causing some obvious issues. We had a housemate meeting to resolve the issues and  decided on whoever had done so should clean the dryer by the end of the night. However, Beth made some comments during the meeting saying I shouldn\u2019t live there and my health shouldn\u2019t be a reason for others to accommodate around me( I have Crohn\u2019s disease) and just seemed overall upset at me in particular. I own an iPad and rarely use the dryer so I knew I wasn\u2019t the issue when it came to the dryer, but couldn\u2019t pinpoint the exact issue she had with me. However the next morning I received a text from Beth saying I hadn\u2019t cleaned the dryer and not to use the household stuff anymore. I had defended myself and explained that I hadn\u2019t used the dryer besides cleaning brand new sheets and also don\u2019t own any pens. Her boyfriend, Phil, backed her up saying that they had assumed it was me. Stating that I\u2019m the least tidy of the house and assumed it would be me to leave the dryer like this.

She is old and has pancreatitis, but I\u2019ve never seen it this bad. \n\nA few days ago, around 5am, my mom called me while I was on a trip saying the dog is bleeding everywhere and she\u2019s at the ER now.  Later that morning, once I was fully awake, I called to ask how the dog is.  Dog needed to stay in ER for minimum 3 days for monitoring.  ER ends up discharging her early because \u201cshe has an appetite\u201d. Dog still has diarrhea and couldn\u2019t hold her own head up. \n\nI visited my parents today to check up on the dog. Dog was not doing great. Trouble breathing and wheezing loudly. I told my parents she needed to go back and the ER discharged her too early. My mom and I took her back, and it was there that they found the dog has an enlarged heart, which could contribute to the breathing issues. Vet gave a pain killer shot (stomach) and recommended giving the other pain med she was already prescribed in conjunction because they work well together. Vet goes on to say the dog needs to see a cardiologist for medications because it will lead to congestive heart failure. To this my mom replied \u201cWell she\u2019s got to die from something!\u201d and laughed. \n\nWhen we got home, I said to my parents (because dad always sides with mom), that I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re just going to let her die knowing there\u2019s something they could do.

After I argued how disgusting that is she said \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d just so I would stop talking. Then she brought up the next time the dog is due for pain meds. 8-12 hours between each dose.  This dog is laying on the couch trembling and wheezing, and she says \u201cI\u2019ll wait until 12 hours\u201d. I said \u201cDo you guys just not take care of her because it\u2019s inconvenient to you?\u201d to which my dad yelled to \u201cstop hitting us about this\u201d. The biggest issue for them is money. That and they are generally considerably less empathetic than most people I know.  They fall in the lower middle class range. \n\nMy parents then sternly implied I needed to leave.

However a lot of that changed when she went off to school so we weren\u2019t able to see eachother as much. She was not able to come down at all but recently she had found out that she was gonna be able to come down and see me. I was super excited and for about a week we planned everything out. We talked about the restaurants we were gonna go to and all the old places we used to hang out at and I was super excited. So the Thursday finally came and she said she was gonna be one day late so i didn\u2019t think much of it. Then she lets me know that she can\u2019t come at all because she has alot of assignments and jus can\u2019t make time this weekend. So of course I was bummed out but I didn\u2019t think to much and thought she was jus busy. However the Monday comes and I was taking to one of our mutual friends and she was talking about how my friend had the best weekend. Thinking it was a joke I laughed but then my friend went on to explain to me that she was not busy at all and hadn\u2019t been for the entire week but decided to stay at school where she went to a party and got with dudes. While the entire time I was under the impression that she was up in her dorm studying and doing alot of work. It\u2019s not the party part that made me aggravated it was more of her lying to me jus so she could hook up with people insted of following through on her word and coming see me. So then when I confronted her about it out of anger she got made at me saying I needed to stay out of her personal life and that what she did was none of my business and to jus get over it. This upset me quit a lot so I decided to stop texting her. Then about an hour later she texted me why I was upset and telling her it was because of the lies she continued to tell me then acted like I was in the wrong. She then told me to get over myself and that her bday dinner was that weekend and she wanted me to drive up the two hours to go and see her. When I told her no saying it was a long drive and gas is not cheap and that I was still upset with her she unadded me and blocked my number. Then the Friday the night before her dinner she texted me asking if I was really not gonna come and if I was really gonna put a price on our friendship(referring to me saying gas was expensive). I told her yes and that until she apologizes I don\u2019t want to speak with her. She then went on to tell me I\u2019m the one who is making this friendship difficult and now will not respond to me.

As far as I know he never cheated on me, but that is my biggest anxiety. \n\nFast forward to last Monday when he went on work-organized teambulding with a mixed group of guys and girls in their twenties. He was acting like he doesn't want to go and that it will be horrible, but I feel like that was one of the white lies he said to comfort me because he could have just opted not to go.\n\nAnyway, he had been enjoying himself and partying and drinking until late hours which is so unlike him. Their accomodation was really fancy and romantic, if I may add - perfect for couples. His change of personality on that trip made me anxious as fuck. He was barely checking in with me for the first five days. I'm talking one text when he woke up and one when he went to bed. Combined with my trust issues, on Friday night I blew up on him. I told him I don't feel like I can trust him and that I felt horrible. He just agreed (?) and ignored me. When I asked if we could talk for a bit, he said that it would feel rude to his collegues if he left them to talk to me.\n\nMind you, my anger got the best of me, I felt unimportant to him because he couldn't spare five minutes for me in five days. I told him fine, that he can fully enjoy their company as for I will not be bothering him on his trip anymore. I've blocked him on everything (very mature, I know).

He was visibly angry with me saying that I ruined his trip. Based on what had happened during the weekend (more partying and games which he enjoyed according to social media), I didn't feel like I ruined anything nor was that my intent.

We weren\u2019t worried about living together since both of us have been friends so long, which hasn\u2019t changed: we co-exist pretty well. We both have boyfriends (I\u2019m gay). However her boyfriend is ALWAYS over; I pretty much expect him to be here. Her boyfriend (19M) doesn\u2019t have the best home life. He still lives with his parents and him and his dad get into fist fights. He has been respectful when he\u2019s over: cleans up after himself, and pretty much chills in her room mostly. He isn\u2019t the nicest to her, but I have stayed out of that since it isn\u2019t my business. However there\u2019s a couple of things that irked me to say the least:\n\n1) He bought a shot gun and my roommate asked if he could keep it here since he couldn\u2019t keep it at home. She said that we would be safer with a gun since neither of us have muscle, and are pretty much fucked if someone breaks in. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with a gun being in the house and didn\u2019t know why she would be, since we are both very far left in our views on subjects like firearms: there is more danger with a gun than without. She respected my position, said she would make sure he didn\u2019t keep it here, and it hasn\u2019t been brought up since. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I had just gotten back from vacation and needed to grab something from my roommate\u2019s room when she wasn\u2019t home. I wasn\u2019t snooping through anything in her room. Both of us are cool with each other going into our rooms if there is something we need (ex. getting dishes from out of the other\u2019s room before running the dishwasher). The case to her boyfriend\u2019s gun was laying out in the open on her floor, I don\u2019t know where the gun was and I didn\u2019t go looking for it.\n\n2) He is a recovering drug addict who has had a couple relapses, which doesn\u2019t bother me: we all make mistakes. My roommate and her BF got into a fight, and his response was to lock himself in her bathroom (we have separate bathrooms) and snort lines. I wasn\u2019t cool with this and I voiced this to her. I don\u2019t want any hard drugs in our house and neither does she. He has also come to our house high multiple times, which pisses me off and scares my roommate. I feel like he\u2019s disrespected our home and both of us.\n\n3) I hate that he\u2019s always here, especially when we aren\u2019t home. My roommate sometimes gives him a spare key to lock and unlock the door if neither of us are home. Before he comes over my roommate usually says \u201cI don\u2019t think he is going to stay the night,\u201d he usually does. This also happened tonight. If my boyfriend stays the night ( only 2-3 times per week) he leaves soon after I do in the morning and is never in our house if neither of us are home. I know that my roommate\u2019s BF\u2019s home life isn\u2019t the best, but at the end of the day, I didn\u2019t sign a lease with him, and sometimes I just don\u2019t want anyone over.

My mom freaked and started going on about how the whole family isn't going to revolve around me and how I live with other them so I can't all the choices about what happens at home. I was pretty annoyed about what she said but then started thinking about how even though my parents likely started my eating disorder, they aren't obligated to support me and my recovery. This is my eating disorder, and if I really want to recover, I need to stop waiting for people around me to help and making excuses and do it myself.

The bigger ones, Brie and Cheddar, just turned one  and are very energetic and messy. We couldn't leave them alone for 3 minutes without they destroying  something around the house. So we decided to send them to daycare 2 days a week, hoping it would help them. I spent hours researching daycares around our house, then I finally chose one that, even though was not as close to our home as we hoped, was in our budget and had lots of greats reviews. \n\nSince the daycare was far from our house, we couldn't walk them there so we hired their service to pick them up and drop them off. They've been going there for a little over a month and it's been great! We receive lots of pictures of them having fun with other pups and can finally leave our house without worrying about what they are going to destroy next. \n\nSo today was just like any other day, I wake up at 8:30 to take them to the car that's picking them up. I notice it's not the usual driver and this one got a little scared when they started barking at a dog in the street. However I didn't think much of it, it was a professional after all, so I just helped her put them in the car and saw them off. Since today was a holiday here and I stayed up late last night drinking and playing boardgames with some friends, I just went right back to sleep, thinking my dogs would spend a day having fun and being taken care of.  \n\nI wake up at 1pm with 20 missed calls from the daycare, I call them back worried just to find out that as soon as they got there they escaped from the driver and ran off to the streets. The lady instead of going after them simply went in and told the receptionist \"hey someone has to go and get them\" which resulted in both my dogs being missing for 40 whole minutes. But not to worry! They found them just in time to see Brie getting hit by a motorcycle and them hitting Cheddar, sending him sliding through the road. They took them to the vet, where they found out Brie had a broken rib and a punctured lung and had to immediately go into surgery so they could get all the air out of her chest. She is now intubated and the vet says she isn't high risk FOR NOW. Cheddar got a little luckier and didn't need surgery but he also has a punctured lung. \n\nWhen my boyfriend heard the news he was LIVID and wanted to sue them as soon as possible, I however feel like, even though they did mess up, they are trying to help and the owner of the daycare seemed really worried and offered help and even said she could uber me to the clinic and go with me if I didn't want to go by myself. So I feel like as long as they pay for the bills there's no need to sue since they are being so sweet and doing everything in their power to help.

When I would text them if they did wanted to hang out during my day off I would always have a response of \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d or \u201cI am tired from work\u201d I understood and told them it was alright.

I was angry they called me a bitch saying i was crying over nothing and they admitted to bedazzling my car for not being true friend to them and bedazzling their windows to make it seem someone did it since they \u201cthought i was really stupid to not think it was them\u201d.

In August of 2020 my brother met my soon to be sister in law and he proposed to her earlier this year. The wedding has already been completely planned out. A date and location are set, bride has her wedding dress, and their honeymoon is booked. I found out not too long ago that my future sister in law had already chosen all of her bridesmaids, one of them being my sister. But not me. Now, I don't expect my future sister in law to worship me or anything of the sort, and as long as my brother is happy then I'm happy for him. But I can't help but feel really hurt that I don't get to really be a part of it. My parents couldn't care less. I was not given any sort of role at all, I'm just expected to be another face in the crowd.\n\nI know it's the bride that traditionally picks everything, from the cake to the flowers, yet it feels like I've been hit. I honestly don't want to go because I feel like a black sheep. The bride to be has also already obtained the bridesmaids dresses and let each one pick theirs out. Admittingly I have not said anything to her or even my brother for that matter because I don't want to instigate an argument that I know will likely result in a lecture from my parents. I'm still happy for my brother because this person is his actual first ever relationship (he's autistic and short so he was harshly judged by others for much of his life) and they seem to truly love each other. I also have nothing against my future sister in law, but is it wrong for me to want to be included in a special way since this is my sibling + future sibling in law I'm talking about? \n\nI could always tough it out I know, simply swallow my pride and go. I just want to know if I'm being overly butthurt and therefore the one in the wrong about it. It's not that I even want to hurt my future sister in law in return or my brother for that matter, I just don't feel like I really have a place in the upcoming ceremony.

She said she would be back in March of next year once her relatives lease was up in Florida and then she would be getting the rest of her things and would be moving for good. She has 2 cats that she wasn\u2019t able to take with her and she didn\u2019t want to just get rid of them if she was returning at some point.

We already have 3 of our own cats that I mainly take care of. I refill their water fountain everyday. I feed them all every day. I clean the litter box, etc. I\u2019m not saying she doesn\u2019t do anything because she does but, I do the majority of it all. So when she told me about it at first I immediately said no. I said no because now that\u2019s 5 cats. 5 cats I now have to take care of for 6 months (at least). \n\nI say at least because who knows if this girl (that I\u2019ve never met or heard of) will come back when she says so. Of course my gf tells me her story and why she needs to leave and everything and I feel bad for her. I say \u2018sure\u2019 last minute and now that they\u2019re here I\u2019m regretting it. They\u2019re older cats (older than ours) they are just hiding, haven\u2019t shown them the litter box because of them just hiding under our couch so one of them already pooped (or threw up I couldn\u2019t tell) on the floor and drug it on our carpet.

You look like someone died in your family.\"\n\nI just shook my head and said \"It's fine, it's nothing.\" because I wasn't comfortable enough to share something so deeply personal to her.\n\nShe pushed further, asking me several times and even saying to drop the \"shy boy act\" because we're now grown adults. It made me snap, so I told her \"I just don't want to talk to someone I'm not friends with.\" and walked out.\n\nApparently, people now call me an incel/woman-hater because of what happened. I think she twisted the story of our interaction because several people witnessed the two of us talking and she didn't want to get embarassed or tell the real reason why I walked out.\n\nSo now, I'm receiving hate messages from the people of our class and even from people that I don't know, calling me derogatory names.\n\nAITA for shutting her down?

He has tried some in the past but basically he doesn't do them and doesn't want her too either. We are all around our late 20s\n\nPersonally I do drugs recreationally and it's no secret in our social circle.

We went do my car and did it there. Then basically just talked for a while. That was the first time we did it. We did it another time later on in the same way.

We\u2019ve met in middle school and now we\u2019re in college. I can\u2019t go into detail about the experiences that we\u2019ve been through, but we\u2019ve grown to have a sisterly bond. \n\nBut between the two of us, she was always the more approachable one. Because of that, people have often taken B for granted. She was so kind that she would often feel guilty about the thought of saying \u201cno.\u201d Especially whenever there\u2019s a guy who likes her. They always think that her kindness is an invitation to flirt. And I cannot count the times where she asked for my help to intervene because she felt terrible when rejecting them. \n \nSo now we move to the present. Recently there\u2019s this guy (G) who\u2019s making advances at B. This guy is a mutual friend of ours, and we get along just fine with him.\n\nUntil a rumor circulated that he was dating B.\n \nTo keep things short, I discovered through that G himself was the one who made that rumor. And that he\u2019s has been making advances towards B for a while now. \n\nOf course I immediately told B, and she expressed her uncomfortableness about the situation. But then again, she felt guilty thinking about rejecting G so she let the rumor slide. \n\nWe both thought that G would stop after that but he kept making advances, such as asking his friends to set him up with her and asking to use her game account. \n\nThroughout this whole ordeal I had to watch my best friend grow increasingly uncomfortable, and just today he made the decision to use her account to buy her a gift, \n\nI was livid. B told me that she now felt that she owed G something. He made it even harder for her to reject him by giving her a gift. \n\nI told my s/o about this, who was a close friend of G. I asked my s/o if I could talk to his friend to stop whatever he was doing. \n\nAnd then I got into an argument with my s/o about it. \n\nMy s/o told me me that he just wanted to help his friend and now this happened. I told him that it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do, because all G was doing was making B uncomfortable. Then my s/o told me that he should be the one to talk with G, not me. His reasoning behind this is because he thinks something might go wrong if I was the one who did. \n\nI\u2019m confused.

We have different values and I've always found him somewhat arrogant. \n\nI met Lee fairly often while they were together. He seemed like a lovely boy but he was very shy and anxious. To be honest, their relationship seemed creepy to me partly due to the age gap. I don't know Lee's age but he appears to be in his mid-20s at the oldest. He barely looks older than my son whereas Greg is nearly 50. My husband informed me this is \"common in the gay community\". The way Greg spoke to Lee was extremely condescending. He made fun of him when he spoke and talked over him as if he wasn't there, he told \"funny\" stories about mistakes Lee had made, he ordered him around. I found it very uncomfortable. On a few occasions I quietly asked Lee if he was okay but he tried to laugh it off.\u00a0 \n\nObviously we saw less of Greg and Lee over lockdown. When I saw Lee for the first time early this summer, I was shocked by how different he looked. He was always a good-looking boy and even though he was shy he was very smiley and energetic. When I saw him this time, he looked pale, thin and just very sad and withdrawn. Greg was quick to explain this away by saying Lee was stressed at work but it didn't seem right to me. I could see Lee tensing up when Greg spoke to him or touched him and Greg was being over-the-top nice to him which was unusual. That was the last time we saw Lee before they broke up.\u00a0 \n\nThey have been apart for a couple of months now and Greg is still not accepting it. He has been signed off work with depression and he is drinking a lot. He always was a bit of a drinker but now it appears to be most days. All he can talk about is getting Lee back, he talks about writing to him or visiting him despite being asked not to. Now he's coming up with bizarre ideas like buying him a kitten or giving him money to pay for therapy.\u00a0 \n\nI don't know exactly what happened in their relationship and Greg is not forthcoming with any details. From what I observed, he did not treat Lee well when they were together and I would go so far as to say his behaviour may well have been abusive. So far I've tried to stay out of it but when he started talking about sending him money or buying him pets I decided someone needed to step in. I told him he needs to leave Lee alone, let him move on with his life, and take responsibility for his behaviour.

Over the past year he has also frequently asked me for \u201chelp\u201d while he jerks off, AKA letting him feel up my vagina and body and kiss me while he touches himself. He says that this helps speed up the process but a few times it has still taken him over an hour of feeling me up while jerking off to come. He also says the reason he asks me for help is because he gets pain from blue balls if he doesn\u2019t come.

He always says \u201cit will only take 5-10 or 15 minutes\u201d but it sometimes takes over 30 minutes or 1 hour. It also makes me feel objectified as I\u2019m basically just a body he is using to get off, and he doesn\u2019t do things that would feel pleasurable to me when doing this, but just whatever he likes to help get off, so it feels a bit like being pawed at and isn\u2019t enjoyable for me. It often feels physically uncomfortable and I feel awkward since it happens when I\u2019m not in the mood and I have to watch him try to jerk off for a while. I have expressed this and he apologizes but he continues to ask me to do this, and lately it has been as frequent as every other day or every couple of days. This has made me feel increasingly annoyed and resentful over time when he asks me to help him jerk off.

Reason number 3 (final reason) is because something he did today so, basically our mom told us to put some clothes away and I sit in the loft to talk to my friends and, he comes out takes my blanket off of me and tells me to pit my clothes away. So, I go in the room and do just that I take my clothes out the basket and put them on my bed so the guy who barked at me to put my clothes away is on his phone loading into a smite match I manage to put half my clothes away before he starts putting his away then he gets mad at me for putting his clothes on his bed..What was he expecting me to do rummage though the entire basket and find my clothes he never even told me to not take his clothes out.

We had a baby (Adam, now 30) and got divorced soon after. We definitely weren't ready for married life or parenthood, but we worked better as co-parents than as a couple, so that's how things were for ten years afterwards, during which time my husband had a child with someone else. When his daughter (Stella, now 24) was 4, we got together again and now we've been married for 18 years and have one more kid. Stella has split her time between our house and her mother's since she was 5, but she's lived with us full time since she was 18. Where we are, it's quite common for adult children to live with their parents until they're financially stable or want to move in with someone. Adam lived with us until he got married at 27 and Stella still lives with us. Stella wasn't very good with money when she started working, so we started charging her for \"rent\" to help her save (she knows it's because of that and that we put the money on a savings account for her). We never did this with Adam, because he was always responsible with his finances.\n\nAdam now lives about one hour away and has a baby. He works 4 days a week and his wife is still on maternity leave so when he has his off days in a row, they come to stay with us. These days don't always fall on weekends. The problem here is that Stella works from home and she sometimes needs to work nights. Some of these nights have fallen on days Adam is here. The last time it happened, Stella got extremely upset because the baby cried a lot and her boss said on a call it was \"unprofessional\". So, she asked us if it was possible for Adam not to come when she has to work nights. We told her no, as Adam is only able to come here when his work allows and we don't want to have to make his stays even rarer. We don't have any more available bedrooms she could move into, so we said that the best we could do was try to convert a part of our garage into a little workstation for her. She got really angry again, because she says the garage isn't comfortable and she shouldn't have to move her workspace just because Adam stays here occasionally. We told her she could work from there only occasionally, but since she has a lot of cables, monitors, devices, things, she says that's not feasible. So, we had this huge fight where we told her this was take it or leave it and she started accusing us of favoring Adam, saying we're willing to accomodate him more than her, that we charge her rent when we never charged him and that should mean she has more control over this house, and that we should be ashamed for suggesting that she should work in a garage. She then implied it was because she was not my bio daughter. I simply left the room, and my husband kept arguing with her, at which point I overheard her call us some not-so-nice names.\n\nMy husband and I were pretty certain about our positions, but honestly, her accusing us of favoritism is making us feel terrible.

One of the women in particular, we shall call her Sally, and I have been messaging one on one. Over the months, this has turned into flirting and the exchange of sexual pictures and messages. The rest of the gaming group is unaware of our personal interactions. I have grown to have genuine emotions and care for Sally and she claims to feel the same. We understand however the limitations of our \u201conline relationship\u201d so to speak (she lives on a different continent). We realize that this is more a fantasy that we can enjoy but not treat seriously since we have never met in person nor do we speak on the phone much. It was fun to flirt with this online stranger at first but I began to treat her as a legitimate girlfriend. Things come to a head a few weeks ago when we decided to video chat for the first time. I realized that she wasn\u2019t the fantasy in my head and I feel incredibly guilty. I do not find her physically attractive yet I can not let go of the fantasy I built up in my head. I decided not to tell her until I sorted out my emotions. Sally has been on vacation and not active in the gaming group since then. The group decided to video chat and I found myself attracted to one of the other women, we will call her Anne. Anne is everything I thought Sally would be. After the call, Anne called me personally and said she felt a spark too. The conversation for hot and heavy. I still feel horrible about Sally and feel like I am a terrible personal for getting roped into these \u201conline relationships\u201d. Frankly I feel like a loser for letting things get serious with Sally, who I don\u2019t know in real life. A friend in the group told me we are here to play the game, not relive high school relationship drama. He is right. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t have casual friendly relationships with the group members like everyone else. Today, everything was revealed.

Neither of us was a dog person but my wife eventually changed that and we adopted a puppy that\u2019s now 3 years old. My cousin on the other has always being very narcissistic thinking herself as of Ellen Woods (legally blonde) type of woman.\n\nStory: Almost 2 years ago my sister adopted a Saint Bernard pup and I think my cousin was jealous because she likes to be the center of attention, so like 3 months ago my cousin adopted a beautiful black puppy, as dog people that we have become my sister and I sent gift and toys for the puppy (Peony) and eventually managed to meet and interact with her, and so did our dogs. Jump to 2 weeks ago, I got a text from my cousin asking if I knew someone willing to adopt Peony because my cousin wanted to go take care of our aunt (she said my cousin didn\u2019t need to do that) who lives in NYC (we don\u2019t live in USA) and that Peony was growing to big for her to be able to take her there. While angry that she was abandoned her pup I at least hoped that Peony would end in a true loving home, then I didn\u2019t hear from my cousin anymore. Then 2 days ago while scrolling Facebook I came across a post from the shelter my cousin adopted Peony from putting her back for adoption; I was sad but wished Peony luck. Later that same day while talking to my mom I found out that my cousin not only gave Peony back but she did in fact adopt a smaller, light colored pup; I was angry, after my sister sent me a photo of the new dog and confirmed what my mother told me I was shaking in anger. I sent a text to my cousin telling her that what she did to Peony was unforgivable, that I didn\u2019t want her to contact me or my wife ever again and that she was dead to me for what she did to poor little Peony. My wife said that I shouldn\u2019t have done that, since she was my closest cousin, but after what she did I actually don\u2019t see myself keeping that relationship; I have yet to have feedback from family once they know what I said to her, but since it is been 2 days and I haven\u2019t gotten anything I need to ask AITA?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1630911674.0, "author_fullname": "Herik1985", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/piuby3/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_she_is_dead_to_me_for/"}, {"title": "AITA for not hiding my boyfriend from my nephews?", "content": "I (16M) was our parents miracle baby that they had late in life.

My question is whether I\u2019m TA for continuing to do it after she asked me to stop.

I don\u2019t compliment everyone, and I only do it if I genuinely like the thing I\u2019m complimenting, but I\u2019m definitely more loose with them than most people.

No biggie, if she doesn\u2019t want them and they make her uncomfortable I wont do it. Compliments are only worth it if the person receiving them feels happier after anyways. The issue is that she is now pushing me to stop complimenting people all together, saying things like \u201cwhat if they have an anxiety disorder?\u201d Or \u201cyou\u2019re a man and it makes women uncomfortable to be complimented by men\u201d. I agree on the latter, I\u2019m not some weirdo and I grew up in a really feminist household, which is why I make an effort to purposefully only use words like \u201cyour tattoos are rad\u201d or \u201cyour hair is really cool\u201d when I\u2019m complimenting femme people, but she insists that\u2019s still too much.

K dated a newly 13-year-old girl online for months while he was 16 and a little while he was 17. This relationship was extremely sexual. He'd send her explicit photos and have her send photos back. They'd have very long explicit calls and he was just overall obsessive and abusive with her. On top of this, he would sexually harass a lot of other people, including me. It's a big situation but it's too much to fit here.\n\nBasically, he hurt a lot of people... Since I went to school with him I thought I should warn other people of the horrible things he did. I posted a story with his face and name, warning my small following of classmates to not get involved with him. It got about 30 views from my classmates and an old friend asked if she could repost it to her story as well (she has 1000 followers.) Now note, I felt inclined to do this because K had shown up at my house days before.

I am the youngest of my first cousins, and they always kind of looked down on me. When I was going through university  when everyone was poor- and me even moreso because I was a student and orphaned of my father- none of my cousins gave a flying F about me. No, there weren't a lot of jobs available for students.

Now that I have money, the whole family is falling over themselves to talk to me.   \nSo after my first business did well, I decided to open a second one. This one would require someone to supervise my employees since I would not be in the country a lot.  \n\n\nOne of my cousins, who is recently retired, has been harassing me about giving him the supervisor job. He has the experience for it, but I don't trust him because last year during Corona I asked him to check on a property I wanted to buy, and he basically blew the deal for me because he \"didn't like the seller\".

Emma seemed unphased and was pretty mad with me when I told her she wasn\u2019t playing on the scooter anymore and I was putting it aside.

I told them that it's my wedding, i can customise it however I want and that I don't want to do things I don't connect with. Even after hearing about my strong feelings towards certain things, they have not made any attempts to modify or omit them.

The close friend of mine who i will refer to as C had met her before i did and previously had a one night stand with her. The next time they hung out, i also came and long story short we ended up essentially running a train on her. this was all meaningless at the time, and this was the first time i had met her and had no idea that i would build a relationship with her. They never hung out again after that and me and M continued to hang out and become closer. Eventually we talked about it and i said i didn\u2019t know if i could be in a relationship with her because of the unfortunate way we met and she wanted me to just ignore it. I decided that she was worth it and it wasn\u2019t a big deal since we didn\u2019t even know eachother when all this happened and it didn\u2019t really mean anything. we agreed that if it bothered us in the future then we would be patient with eachother\n\nFast forward to now, after dating M for 4 months i have gotten closer with her and developed stronger feelings, however now the thought of C,M, and I having sex that night seems to be stuck on my mind a lot and can sometimes make me sad.

But i made friends with girls named Samantha, Wilma, and Tilly.\n\nBut Samantha started acting different. I guess for some reason she got angry at me, and purposely tried to trigger me in any way she could. Samantha knew i was in recovery for a pretty severe eating disorder, yet she would just randomly ask me questions about how she could starve herself, etc. She would do this constantly, most notably when we were on the phone with Tilly and Wilma. Samantha would always single me out and ask me these bs questions out of absolutely nowhere, with no warning. I never knew how to respond and would get very upset, as not only was it incredibly triggering but embarrassing as well. In fact, when I first told Samantha that I was a recovering anorexic early into our first year of high school, she looked at me and said \u201cAnorexia? Don\u2019t you have to be skinny to have that?\u201d (For context, every woman on my mothers side of the family has wide hips, thick thighs, and a bit of meat on out bones. It\u2019s in my genetics).\n\nSamantha would also make me feel really disrespected and invalidated. When I came out as lesbian she all of a sudden started sending me all these almost-naked guys that she thought were hot and tried to get me to like them. When she found out I was asexual she started talking about how amazing sex was and how embarrassing it would be if I died a virgin. Just all around subtly making me feel like shit. \n\nThree months into sophomore year it all came to a head and we all fought with Samantha. We cut her out of our friend group entirely. \n\nThings were going fine until a few months ago when  found out that Tilly was taking to Samantha again. I was pretty upset but Tilly said that she would mostly ignore Sam. But I started my junior year recently and Tilly, Wilma, and Samantha were all hugging and laughing like best friends in the hallways. Tilly and Wilma wouldn\u2019t even talk to me. The three of us were all going to go to a coffee shop after school, but then they decided to bring Samantha too. So I bailed. They know how she treated me and that I do not like her and don\u2019t feel comfortable even talking about her.\n\nI got texts from Tilly and Samantha telling me how I was being irrational and I should just forgive Samantha and be friends with her again because what happened was \u201cso long ago\u201d. They said I was being a petty bitch and that I just needed to get over everything and \u201cget off my high horse because I was acting no better than Samantha\u201d.

They both work at the same neighborhood Walmart. We both live with our parents. Me and my brother are disabled and can't drive.\n\nI got me and my sister a dentist appt, we get it done, then go for pizza. Our mom texts us to get a frappe from McD's, she doesn't want to but agrees to anyways since it's on the way home.

It's usually around this time she drives to her BF's to wake him up.\n\nIt takes a good 15 minutes for us to get to the speaker. During the 10 minutes waiting AT the speaker she says how she could be at her BF's rn and how she wants to drive off  and claim that the McD didn't have the frappes available. The speaker-person then gets to us, she says the order (plain words but poor tone), they ask if that is all, she says \"yes thanks\" but with the tone again, the speaker-person starts to say the total, but she drives off. I tell her that just because she is upset that she isn't at her BF's doesn't mean she can treat people that way. She says \"I don't care. I didn't even want to take you to the dentist or do this.\" I point out how she HAD to go to the dentist and she was fine when the pizza cut into BF time. I also tell her she really needs a reality check for the behavior she's had since getting the BF. She tries to deflect and claim I treat service workers that way too, I say I haven't and will never treat people that way, she goes quiet. \n\nFF to 4 days later; she was asked to take our brother to the \"big\" Walmart so that he can get the groceries we need for the next week. The \"big\" Walmart was specifically requested because the neighborhood one does not carry a lot of the stuff we need from the \"big\" one. She goes to see her BF at his lunch hour every day he works.\n\nShe starts complaining about how our brother got upset at her bc he thought they were going to get groceries before her BF's lunch time and that time was running out of the day and he'd now be stuck with her until she was done at the lunch. I said I didn't disagree with him bc she was taking way too long to get dressed to go see her BF. She then decides to make the comment that we ALL have to \"bow down\" to her schedule now and will have to get over it. I say everyone else has lives too and that she shouldn't have agreed to taking him especially if she can't handle missing even 1 day/night with her BF. \u200bShe storms out. \n\nMy mom gets onto me telling me how my sister was extremely upset with me because I told her I wish she would get hurt during the McD issue (I assume because I told her she needs a reality check) and I need to just get along with her. I try to explain she has been acting this way since she got her BF and that anytime anything interferes with her time with her BF she acts extremely mean and hateful to anyone around her.

R started working there a few months before me, and since we're newbies and were constantly together, we got really close. J is not that close to me, tho.\n\nSince the school had to stop with on-site classes, we started to teach online using laptops, and everything went smoothly while we were using a software. But now we switched to another one and this particular teacher (whom I'm calling M) isn't able to use it bc she doesn't own a laptop and instead uses one from the company she works for durring weekdays and she doesn't have the authorization to install new softwares in it. She's a great teacher, but this laptop issue raised a discussion on whereas she should buy a new laptop just to teach even if she doesn't want one.\n\nThe one who actually said it was J, but R was chatting with the secretary and they both agree with J. They asked my opinion and I asked if M could afford a new laptop with one month payment from the school. I knew she couldn't cause even though I don't actually know how much she gets per month, I know it's not very different from what I get, and it not that much.\n\nI know she's probably payed enough in the other job to be able to, but no one in the school actually knows if she can since she also has house bills and provides for those who live with her, and even if she can, I don't think she should be obliged to spend at least 2k in a GOOD laptop if she doesn't want nor has a way to, specially when it wasn't explicit in the contract that teachers should provid their own tools for working. On the contrary, everything else is provided by the school. EVERYTHING.\n\nThey still insisted on saying she should provide a new tool. I tried to argue about it and I might have been a bit too forthcoming. It really wasn't intentional and I did appologize. Since R and the secretary are both friends of mine, they accepted it and they know I wasn't overstepping (not on porpouse anyways), but I did call them out on the matter cause it really don't seem fair.\n\nI think that if it was I in M's position, I woudn't be able to buy a new laptop since I only work at the school and what I get is barely enough to go through the month (I still live with my parents and my dad has a job, but still both of our salaries combined is barely enough). Luckly I do own a laptop of my own and I use it to teach, but I can't say the same for my colleague.\n\nFor now she's borrowed J's personal laptop, but he clearly isn't happy with that, but I stant by what I told R.

We have been together virtually every moment for the past two and a half years since then. We dated, quickly became engaged and married less than seven months after meeting. \n\nAbout a month before our planned vacation/elopement, he announced that he was going to have a house guest for about two weeks and that our sleepover arrangement at his place would be altered during this time. He is from a culture where homosexuality is a punishable crime and I always assumed that this was a straight person from there who he felt obligated to host and not be out to. We continued to see each other for dinner each night and he even stayed at my place one night during this time despite being deathly allergic to my cat. We also had a long weekend away during this time which gave me the impression that there wasn\u2019t much of a significant relationship between him and the houseguest. \n\nDuring a recent vacation he mentioned that his ex wanted to visit during the upcoming long holiday weekend and asked if I would have a problem if he stayed with us. I said sure, why not. It\u2019s been two and a half years since they were together and he clearly knows we are married.\n\nSo today as I\u2019m trying to get to know the ex. He mentioned that he had visited here for two weeks and stayed at my husbands place during the aforementioned period and stated it was \u201cWhile we were still together\u201d. I was flabbergasted. \n\nI pulled my husband aside and started to ask questions. He\u2019s one of the most honest and forthright people I\u2019ve ever met. This was the first occasion I have had any reason to doubt the trust we have worked hard to build and grow during our relationship. The conversation became tense as I asked why he conveniently omitted the truth about his houseguest. He stated that he didn\u2019t want to cause me any unnecessary pain or hurt, and that the ex\u2019s trip had been planned long in advance. He also said the ex was having difficulty with the end of their relationship and this was the opportunity to put put closure to it. It needed to happen, but what about the six months we had spent together to that point? He claimed he attempted to have the conversation and actually broke up by text, not the classiest move. But the ex made his planned trip nonetheless. \n\nMy husband claims that there was no physical or emotional connection during this trip, but when I asked what the sleeping arrangements were he said that they slept in the same bed despite the presence of a guest room.  \n\nSo here I am trying to process this. We have been working a lot on trust issues and not wanting to get hurt or hurt each other as we both have baggage, but this seems like a big violation of both of those desired relationship goals that I found out completely by accident.

I was extremely exhausted at this point as I got little sleep during the week from being constantly woken up. I told myself to play it cool, roll over and go back to sleep. Eventually I fell asleep but woke up again to more singing, this time to a different song in Mamma Mia. That was my boiling point where I got up, opened my door and yelled \u201cCan you please shut the fuck up. I\u2019m trying to sleep and all I can hear is you singing at the top of your lungs again. You told me you would keep it down and yet here we are having this conversation again. Your singing is unbearable and I\u2019m sick of it\u201d. I slammed the door and went back to sleep, with no singing this time. \n\nMy roommate hasn\u2019t spoken to me in a week and she has been sulking in her room the whole time. I knocked on her door and apologised where she responded \u201cyou can apologise all you want but I won\u2019t forgive you for sabotaging my mental health\u201d. I asked her to expand further on what she meant by that where she said \u201cYou don\u2019t understand how hard it is being locked up in a tiny unit all day without being able to see your friends/family\u201d. Singing to myself and watching TV keeps my stimulated and you want me to sit there and be mute all day.\u201d I told her respectfully that I understand how hard it is to go without seeing your family etc - because we are all in the same situation. I calmly reminded her that I don\u2019t mind her singing or playing the TV loudly, I just want the noise to be kept to a minimum- where possible and to be respectful of my sleeping hours.

We met in college and hit it off pretty quickly I caught feelings fast but at the time she was in a relationship. I respected that and only acted as a friend that relationship ended poorly and she asked me to act as a buffer between her and her ex and I did so walking her to our club meetings and back to her dorms. We spent time like this for about 8 months when I finally worked up the courage to confess my feelings. Her response was that she wasn't ready to be in a relationship at the time but would be open to exploring something more when she was in a better place. After this we got alot closer I we became extremely physically affectionate, while we never kissed or anything more than that we would hug, cuddle and generally be around each other all the time. We had a scheduled hang out time with her best friend and said friends boyfriend that they referred to as double dates. This continued for a while until July when during a get together she pulls me aside to tell me she and Tyler another mutual friend have started dating. I was disappointed because Tyler knew I was interested in Rae but was happy for them. Next time I had a chance I pulled Tyler aside to say I'm happy for him but if he hurts her I will break him. And he tells me that he's happy I finally know as he was worried because he wasn't certain if Rae and I were dating before he asked and that he asked her out April. Tyler told me Rae asked him to wait to tell me because she was worried about my reaction. This really hurt me because this wasn't the first time Rae has made a comment about my reaction and it bothered me because I dropped everything to be there for her. Its been a almost 2 months since I found out and honestly its really put a strain on the friendship I've had because I haven't been comfortable hanging out with those 2 since finding out I've made excuses and canceled our weekly D&amp;D games twice in the pass month. Now Rae just got approved for a job in a Idaho it pays well and is in her degree field so she is moving in 2 weeks. So the week of the move everyone wants to throw Rae a goodbye party and I'm not certain about going on one hand I'm still hurt and not certain about seeing her in person on the other I have no idea when the next time I will see her as I live on the east coast.

But after I realized that nobody(except for 2 of my friends) really texts me first or checks up on me when I\u2019m away, I stopped being the one to always put in the effort to catch up with friends. Because I\u2019m human too I have a life I can get busy or have my lows. Plus law school can be hard.\n\nHowever some of friends started blaming it on my relationship saying that I changed ever since I met him because he is the only one I prioritise. What baffles me is the thing they bring up from the past about me talking a lot about him in the beginning which i stopped a LONG time ago because I don\u2019t wanna share my private life anymore especially with ones who aren\u2019t even interested in hearing it. The ONLY time i do is when they complain about me not sharing anything about how my relationship is going (when they\u2019re the ones who caused me to stop talking about him completely so idk what their point is). But the time I did share it, I regret it because they use that as a way to blame me for being obsessed with a guy and changing as a friend.", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1630826840.0, "author_fullname": "greylune", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pi8ll6/aita_for_no_longer_checking_up_on_my_friends_and/"}, {"title": "AITA for befriending the girl my friend cheated on?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630826861.0, "author_fullname": "luciecoolchick", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pi8lqu/aita_for_befriending_the_girl_my_friend_cheated_on/"}, {"title": "AITA for moving out of our 3 roommate apt?", "content": "Last year I moved in with another 2 girls that were already friends.

Lease had three names on it, and said that we were not allowed to sublease to another tenant and not allowed to have any pets. Rent is high out here though, so we subleased to this girl named Susan under the table. Instead of splitting paying the deposit in 3, we split it four ways, with Susan contributing the same amount as everyone on the lease. We agreed over text, but never in a contract, to split our returned deposit at the end of the lease 4 ways.\n\nDuring our move, we all rented a moving truck together, and while loading her things into the truck, Susan placed an expensive item ($300+ family heirloom) of one of the leaseholder's (Abigail) out on the street to make room for her things. Susan chose to remove this large item and leave it on the street. It was stolen within a couple minutes. Abigail was heartbroken. it was one of the few  items she had left from her childhood. She grew up in poverty, in/ out of homelessness, so being able to hold onto something like that was important to her. Susan promised over text to pay Abigail back in full for the item she lost.\n\nafter move-in, things in the apartment spiraled with the cabin fever. Nobody got along, and susan and the other leaseholder adopted pets. Both of them left animal waste on the floor for days. so long  that the floorboards  warped and stained, and a lot money was removed from the final deposit. Susan's pet also ate and damaged a lot of my work materials  ( I work from home), and Susan verbally offered to pay me back for the damages. Susan also broke a few nice pieces of my kitchenware, which she promised to pay me back for over text.\n\nThings in the apartment reached a head when one of the leaseholders started destroying parts of the apartment over a disagreement, and Susan created a large gas leak, nearly killing two of us. Me and Abigail moved out, but continued paying rent until the lease was fulfilled. It was rough.\n\nFast forward to now. Our rental company has finally sent three of us checks for the deposit now that the lease is over. a pretty measly amount compared to what we paid. Susan's now asking for her share of the check, but has refused paying for our property that she lost and damaged.\n\nyesterday Susan sent a very aggressive email and text to both Abigail and I, telling us she will sue us for her share of the deposit in small claims court if we do not give it to her NOW. I told her that she owes us more money and has refused to pay, and she sent a very rude email back in return, laughing at us. Abigail and I are sure we won't see our money back, and we're worried that Susan may have some footing in court.

I, live with 3 other flat mates including my 28yo brother. This whole lockdown has been a fucking nightmare and most of it boils down to him. \n\nWe\u2019ve had a few arguments already the biggest one before this being his inability to say thank you after I cook a meal (to save on money and grocery trips I\u2019ve put myself forward to cook all the dinners for the flat and have done so for over 3 weeks now without complaining once). I ended up confronting him about this saying it\u2019s not hard to say thank you especially when he always manages to skive off whenever it comes to doing the dishes. He ended up using his anxiety and depression as an excuse and said I sometimes use a tone with him that\u2019s bitchy and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t say thank you because he\u2019s mad with me\u2026. Mad enough to not say thank you, but not mad enough to not eat every last bite of the dinners.. okay sure.  Anyway, we managed to clear this up and make peace.. although he still doesn\u2019t so thank you most the time.

Everyone in our house knows just how much work it takes to get rid of fleas as this isn\u2019t our first rodeo with them. Last year it took us over 4months to get rid of them. So I posted in our flat group chat saying I found a flea and we need to do a bug bomb ASAP. Everyone replied and agreed except my brother. I ended up having to call a flat meeting just to get him out of his room. He said he\u2019s far too stressed with uni to do a bug bomb and hes not getting bitten yet so it can\u2019t be that bad and we should just wait till next week when he\u2019s not so busy. Anyone who\u2019s had fleas in the past knows it\u2019s not something you wait out you have to act fast to make sure they don\u2019t lay eggs. I tried explaining we\u2019d only need to be out of the house for 2.30hours and he could take his laptop outside to do his uni work. He flat out refused to budge saying he\u2019s too stressed out to take time out his day to do it and I was being unreasonable as I don\u2019t go to uni and I have nothing to be stressed out about. I brought up the fact that dealing with a flea infestation and doing all the cooking and cleaning is pretty fucking stressful.

We had tried the long distance for over a year and a half since my uni was out of state but we decided to split. I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t there for my son as much as I wish I had been while I was in school. Was only able to drive to her place to be there weekends and anytime I was off school. At the time I had a college fund that was about 100k from my grandparents had set up for me but since I had a full ride scholarship it was spent on my son instead. On top of money I\u2019d send her from my part time job. It was enough for his needs and a nanny to be there during the week when she was at work. Not weekends since that\u2019s when I\u2019d be there. \n\nWas I a perfect dad? No. I know I wasn\u2019t there for him the way I wished I could until I graduated when he was 2. But I know that at least financially provided for them. anyways her family (parents, sister, and brothers) came up for the first time in years to celebrate my son\u2019s 8th b-day. All of us together.  Haven\u2019t always had the best relationship with them since the break up. And I guessed it was because of not being around my son since I didn\u2019t want to drop out from college. That I understood but it turns out my ex had told them I never paid a cent to her the entire time. Nor that I would stay with them whenever I was off from school. So they were mad because they thought I didn\u2019t help AT ALL. \n\nThat really infuriated me and I had confronted my ex about it. In front of her family I demanded to know why she\u2019d lie about all that especially when I\u2019m even helping her out right now with school. My ex had some problems with financial aid so they\u2019re not helping her out anymore. I\u2019m helping her pay for some of the classes she needs. All this was said with her family in front of us because it pissed me off that she\u2019d paint me in a bad light to them. My ex was pretty mad at the fact that I embarrassed her in front of them. Since she told them she was paying the classes herself. She apologized for what she told them but she still thinks I had no right to bring up the fact that I\u2019m helping pay for her college courses, and making it seem like she can\u2019t take care of herself even now. \nSo now I don\u2019t know. I was mad at what she did but I\u2019m not sure if it was going to far embarrassing her like that in front of her family and telling them I\u2019m still helping her.

I've been learning bit by bit but when I first started I sought out other English speakers to carve myself a friend group. This is about someone who I made friends with during that time. I don't dislike this person, and I respect their partner a lot, and don't want them to see massive consequences for a foolish comment.\n\nThe story:\n\nI made friends with Tim my first week on the job(I've been here a little over a month). He's a nice dude, but he doesn't catch social queues very well, he explained this to me on the first day as he has mild autism.

John is also very nice and I respect him quite a bit, as does management.\n\nTim often spends his lunch with me when John is not around. On this particular day I guess Tim wanted to complain about some coworkers, because he just started talking mad shit about one of them. This quickly spiraled into talking shit about most of our Spanish only speaking coworkers. I was only half paying attention, mostly cause letting people vent when they're pissed off is a habit I picked up in IT when angry people call in.\n\nThen Tim, very loudly, said: \"you know why I love this job? Cause I can talk shit about all these guys and none of them can understand me!\"\n\nI shut that shit down quick. 1. A lot of them speak enough English to understand you're talking shit, and 2. That's a really toxic mindset. His asked me if I really thought they werent talking about me behind my back, and I responded that I didn't care if they do. It's not really my problem. I'm here to clean toilets bro. After that he said maybe I have a point and got quiet, and hasn't said anything similar since. This was also all said about 5 feet away from my other coworker, who speaks fluent Spanish and English, so I know he heard everything.\n\nSo I guess my question is, should I say something to John about the comment Tim made? I've been trying to find John alone but everytime I see him Tim is there or we just don't have enough time to address the issue.

She has completed significant chunks of the puzzles and takes a lot of the joy out of it for me. Because when I get to it large proportions are finished so there is less effort required on my part.

I never brought this up because our relationship was very early on, but was bothered and would get a bit jealous if she was mentioned. Later on into our relationship he would hang out with her and not tell me, or say he was hanging out with other people and not tell me that she was there.

He is awaiting his NY bar license but has expressed his dislike about going into BIG law \u201cever.\u201d He is actually quite excited about his new job because he will be doing Compliance Analysis which he so loved back in law school. \n\nThe only issue is\u2026.

We have had multiple verbal arguments, rather more verbal outbursts from me, every time he starts the conversation about it towards the end of the NYPD hiring process.  He started the lrkcess before our marriage. Initially, I was nonchalant, thinking that he might not actually stand the possible 2 year wait to get in. BUT he got called in for final processing for the academy just a month after our wedding.  \nBut, he withdrew from it. \nEven the Lieutenant  called him as to why he was withdrawing from the final application process.\n\nHe said it\u2019s because We have been arguing about the following concerns TOO much  that it is not worth going further:\n\n1)Security. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m Ready to be a cop\u2019s wife. I am afraid for his life. For my family\u2019s life. Also, I have never thought about marrying a cop and I would like to be further away from violence whatsoever. I dont think I can handle the uncertainty of him coming home alive. And i dont think I can offer a listening ear to the possible cop stories that he may bring home. I am too sensitive and I can easily barf on anything related to trauma.\n\n2)Starting a family. If he starts academy and of course the two to three year probation, he most likely will be taking night shifts, OTs etc. I feel like it would be more difficult to start a family with a rookie cop schedule. He is an only child and I am an child. \n\n3)Dream home. We (mostly I) wanted to start buying our own house in the next year, if he starts to become a cop (which has quite a humble starting annual salary), i believe our dream home will be in the back burner for a while. \n\nSo, because of this. He withdrew from the NYPD academy final process. \n\nAnd now, I keep hearing him sometimes taking a sad  sigh in his office room alone\n. And he keeps bringing it up that he gave this big dream up,  and that he is heart broken, as if it is like breaking up with a prior relationship. He never says he hates me, he never blames me, but everytime he keeps talking about it over again it just makes me feel guilty.

I have certain knowledge and skills not everyone does. I reached out to a group working to save lives and told them it looked like certain folks didn't know yet about available help. They agreed, so I offered to help get the word out. They wanted that, so I did a sizeable chunk of work as a volunteer, and got good feedback. If I had started from scratch instead of relying on previous knowledge it would have been maybe 16 hours of work but honestly because I have done this work before it was only a few hours. It was, however, while taking a break from trying to address a non-immediately life-threatening health problem of my own and manage my preexisting caregiving responsibilities. So it both was and wasn't a big deal for me to pitch in, depending on how you look at it. \n\nThen even though nothing I would do suggests that I am working for them instead of as a private citizen, and my facts have already been verified, they asked me to hold for edits. \n\nExperience -- I have known and worked for years with these people who, like everyone, have strengths and weaknesses -- says they won't be substantive; these people just want to make clear who is in charge. (I know who is in charge; that's why I asked them how to help instead of plunging in on my own.) I honestly think this is a case of \"The perfect is the enemy of the good,\" not an appropriate attempt to maintain reasonable standards. And \"the perfect\" here includes making sure credit goes to the right people and leaves out the urgency of the need. Of course I may have missed something. But this is the sort of work I do all the time and I think I am right. \n\nBecause they are legitimately busy this has meant a day and a half delay so far and it's unclear how much longer. That means a decent chance someone has died who could have accessed help if we had acted sooner.

We all sent in our selfies, so that was one selfie of mine that I actually thought turned out alright for once. I've always struggled with my self-esteem and appearance, and my family including my autistic relative knows about this. My autistic relative went out of her way to save my photo from the group chat and DM'ed it to me. She commented on my face shape and said that I even looked like a certain animal because of my face shape, and it honestly ruined my day. As someone who actively struggles with self-esteem and body image issues, that was a stab to my chest.\n\nWhen I confronted her about it and told her how much it emotionally affected me, she was not serious to my discomfort at all until I questioned her at how not caring about the emotional impact her words had on me may affect our bond - especially since she already knows that I am self-conscious about my appearance because I voiced it to her before. This whole situation made me slip a bit with my eating disorder, which I mentioned to her. She said she couldn't really fully apologize if she doesn't understand what she said actually hurt me. After I confronted her about the entire situation, she pretty much talked about her autism being the reason why she, in her words, can't understand that her commenting on my face is an issue. She mentioned how would I feel if I was not able to understand what I'm saying is problematic to someone and not being able to go back to fix what was said. My brother thinks she may be trying to guilt-trip me so that she can fix the situation without taking full responsibility, but I'm not 100% sure. She mentioned that I should just ignore the situation as she's my relative and that families \"fight all the time and work things out in the end!\" according to her. I'm trying to understand this in her perspective as a neurotypical, but at the same time, it's not like she didn't already know that I struggle with my appearance. Hell, I even mentioned that I was self-conscious about my face as soon as I sent my selfie in the group chat before she even said anything to me.\n\nI got so upset with her that I ended up cutting ties with her for good, including a no-show to family events that I knew she would be coming to - including her own wedding. However, I do feel remorse and guilt because she's my relative, I've known her for so long, and she's autistic which may make her process social situations a bit differently.

I have an older brother who I can often be rude, or disrespectful towards. It\u2019s not always, but if he's arguing with my mother, or angry and telling me to do things or calling me stupid, I\u2019ll talk back and be rude. However, he often treats me like a maid. I\u2019ll make dinner for my family 6 out of 7 days of the week bc my mother works and doesn't have time. I don't get any help from him; he doesn't even do dishes after. He also doesn't help on the days we clean, and he tells me to do things for him that he can easily do himself. He also talks down to my mother and when he's rude with her, it really makes my blood boil. The thing he does that really upsets me is that he will treat me like an idiot or baby talk me when we\u2019re arguing, and often sees me as someone who doesn't know anything, or someone who hasn't experienced life enough, even though we are only a year apart.\n\nRegardless of this, when we aren't fighting, we'll talk, and he'll come to me to complain or talk about his worries, and ill often listen, bc he's my brother, and even if we have our down, I love him. \n\nI've just started university and being in a new environment with no friends has me thinking about how I find it hard to socialize, and I was feeling super insecure about it. I didn't have anyone to talk to, so I told my brother about it. he immediately dismissed me, and told me it wasn't a big deal, and I should just make friends, and that I was making something into a problem that wasn't. I explained to him that even if he doesn't see it as something big, it bothered me, and I didn't want him telling me that. I just needed someone to listen, not tell me my problem isn't a \"big deal\" and that I should \"just go up to people\".

We were quite friendly with the younger of the two even bringing me a gift once. It was a busy Fri 2/7 tables vac. 1 was dirty with a do not sit sign. This table is near wall and last table to sit 3/4. The other sits 2. I seat them at clean table. I return Lady b says they will take the other table. I tell her it's dirty. She says she'll wait. My bell rings So I ask them to give me a a min and otw back from another table lady b is otw to my cleaning cart to do it for me.

I had some internal bruising and some burns, but for the both of us we were pretty lucky physically because the car ended up being totaled. However, after the accident, we really didn't talk about it very much besides if there was an update on the insurance battle over who was at fault or just dark jokes. \n\nThis really lead me to start spiraling out mentally, and just overall being not okay. I really started heading downhill when I finally moved back to college for the fall semester, a couple weeks before my ex was moving in. (we lived next door to each other) The big thing was I didn't let anyone know what was going on, especially him.\n\nAs soon as he finally moved up to school, I felt worse when I saw him, not better, which is what I usually feel after reuniting with him, because every school break we did long distance. I still bottled up my feelings and just spent a few days being with/around him and I felt better. After we classes had started, we didn't see each other as much as before, but I was totally fine with it and was willing to make time to see him between both of our schedules. \n\nI finally got the chance to tell him I was dealing with some issues I've been meaning to tell him about and he kinda looked at me blankly and pushed me out of his room. Then proceeds to text me that we needed to talk tomorrow, but I insisted we should talk now since I just saw him. That's when he breaks up with me and tells me I really need to get help and support for my mental health. He insists that he wants to be friends with me and that he's there for me, and that's the last time we talked.\n\nThis just further upset me, leading me into a manic episode. Now this part gets dark so, be aware. With everything going on and how mentally ill I was, I ultimately tried. This was not because of him, but the added cherry on top of a sundae filled with reasons. Luckily I called help in time and was taken to the hospital where they gave me medicine to reverse any of the effects on me and what I had done.\n\nUpdate to now, I'm doing pretty good with my mental health after a brief stay at a behavioral hospital.

For the past three years I\u2019ve been bringing my best friend (M17) along who I\u2019ve been friends with since sixth grade. The issue is each time we have gone camping I ask to sleep in the same tent as my friend. Each time I\u2019ve asked it\u2019s a lecture on how it would be inappropriate given the difference in sex. This always has made me upset since I value the time I spend with my friends since I know it\u2019s limited. This camping trip has been no different than the others, I am to sleep in the camper with my parents and he is to sleep in the tent outside.\n\nUsually I make the best of it. But the WIBTA situation starts here\n\nI had been sleeping on my couch in the camper when I was woken up by rocking. Initially I tried to go back to bed, but it just got worse. It had been around 1:00/1:30 in the morning, pretty late, so I thought it was some issue in the RV leveling. It wasn\u2019t long until I realized what it was. My parents, both 55, were having sex less than 10 feet away from me (to visualize there\u2019s a slide-out paper screen to separate the rooms). I didn\u2019t know what to do. I tried to avoid confrontation by turning lights on, opening/closing doors, clearing my throat, walking around; all to try and let them know I was awake and aware. This didn\u2019t work and I didn\u2019t know what else to do. Eventually, since I was really tired and have been having a bad week, I got fed up and banged on the side of the wall. They stopped, and I got back on my couch to sleep. But then they started up again. At this point I was irritated and tired so I went outside, where I sit now writing this.\n\nThis was possibly caused by hours of drinking. My friend and I were watching a movie and playing card games inside while they were outside. Usually when they drink they\u2019ll get wildly drunk and end up picking on me, criticizing and insulting me. For context as to why I\u2019m so upset in the first place, ever since I can remember I\u2019ve been berated about my friend choice and been told to pick more girls (note: I have friends that are girls just not very close ones) Every time I have anybody over (strictly 4 hours once a month to \u201cprevent inappropriate things\u201d) it\u2019s always a lecture on how I could have friends over more often if they were girls.

I said I was tired and that my flat was a mess, but that I\u2019d call her back later to see if I wanted her to come or not. Later on, she called back and asked again and I said that after all no, I didn\u2019t wanna hang out today. She said alright and hung up, but she sounded upset. \n\nAt night, when our parents facetimed me I told them that I felt my sister might have been upset with me for not wanting to hang out for the reasons I stated earlier (tired, messy house). After that, my mum kinda blew up at me saying that she didn\u2019t like how I treated my sister, that she was family and \u201cwhat if your dad and I said that to you and told you not to come home because we were tired\u201d. \n\nA little bit of backstory here, the reason my sister and I were never close growing up was because she always shunned me back then. When I wanted to hang out with her and her friends when I was little, she always told me to go away and to never speak to them, however, from what I remember, they were always nice and affectionate with me, letting me play with them when I wanted. My sister and I used to sleep in the same room until I was 12 and she always told me scary stories at night, even though I hated that, and she would further scare me by sneaking up on me or rocking my bed and it was to the point that I cried sometimes. When I tried to call our parents though they thought we were just play fighting. She also always called me a suck-up because I was affectionate with our parents (she rarely ever even hugs them till this day), and one day I was looking through a drawer trying to find coloring pencils and found a piece of paper where she described how much she hated me. There\u2019s a lot more stuff I could talk about, but tldr my sister wasn\u2019t nice to me while growing up. \n\nBack to yesterday, my mum said that it was very upsetting to her that I didn\u2019t want to be closer with my sister even though she\u2019s making an effort to reach out to me and get closer now, but I\u2019m not reciprocating the effort.

Anything from the newest Apple watch to scuba diving to cooking soup--he dives deep. He has always been interested in finance and these days his new kick is cryptos. He is a man of few words but when he starts talking about one of his \"subjects\" he can go on for 2+ hours. \n\nNow if this were a normal conversation with give and take I would be okay as I am also a talker but it is almost completely a one-way road with him stopping only occasionally to ask if I understand something he said. I literally sit in front of him and just nod the entire time because it's impossible to get a word in edgewise. He also goes into elaborate detail, explains history, and gives multiple examples of every topic. I feel as if I am being lectured to at university and have said so to him. The topics (usually finance and crypto) are not something I'm interested in and have said so on multiple occasions. It also doesn't help that this is all happening in a language which I'm not yet fluent (we speak in Korean, my native language is English). Crypto and finance are hard enough to understand in English let alone Korean! His way of speaking can also be very blunt and jarring sometimes which I'm not used to (cultural difference). \n\nIt always follows the same pattern. He will call me / his younger sister / whoever into the room and just start lecturing for at least 45 min (he considers this short) but max 2 hours without checking if we are busy or even interested in the subject to begin with or asking our opinion. I have pointed out these things out but he excuses the behavior by saying it's for our own good and repetition will make it stick in our brain. \n\nTo be fair knowing about finance is helpful and some of his tips are great but the method of delivery is really burdensome. I fell like a scolded child or beleaguered student. \n\nThese days his talks revolve around crypto currency and investing. He keeps insisting I start a portfolio now I've paid off my debt. I downloaded a book about investing and read up on basic principles but I am currently busy with my job language study so studying crypto on top of that is not easy for me (plus I'm not interested).\n\nA few weeks ago he mentioned again I should look into such and such a crypto coin and I snapped and said to stop giving me more homework and that I already feel overwhelmed due to my upcoming language test and work. It led to a huge fight. He once again cannot figure why I get annoyed or angry at these times.\n\nAfter this last fight he even went so far as to say he doesn't see us lasting long term if I get so upset about \"little\" things.

Her dad just went into hospital, and he's been very bossy and hard to please towards her mother. She's constantly on the phone with one of them and her sister trying to sort things out. That's fair enough. I think my dad was picking on her, telling her to stop being maudlin and stop talking about it because she can't do anything. I mean, I find it hard because it makes me upset, too, but I just keep quiet, don't say anything and give her a hug when I think she needs it most. She just said that he died, even though he's certainly not dead and it might still be a long time.\n\nThe thing was, at dinner time, we usually watch something as a group. I always try to choose something everyone likes. My mother had brought up *Cruella* earlier, and I had said I didn't want to watch it, but if everyone else wanted to, \"knock yourselves out\". In other words, why not watch it? I didn't have to. I suggested we watch something a bit light and frothy during dinner, or maybe not watch anything. I was just trying to be nice. I didn't want to watch *Cruella,* but if I watched something short, then they could watch it after dinner and I wouldn't have to sit through it. Deal?\n\nNo, according to both my parents, it was *Cruella* or I was being \"mean\" for no reason, even if I didn't put anything on (which I offered to do because I knew if I was feeling harrassed, I might want a quiet dinner). So I put it on, but read my Kindle instead of watching it. Yes, that was petty, but I don't think anyone even noticed, so it wasn't hurting anyone. It just happened that I wasn't interested in the villain of a movie I've never even watched and that I'd rather read the autobiography of a children's author.\n\nThe thing is, I've been trying really hard to be nice and understanding and sympathetic, even though her behaviour irritates me.

Some back story, I am an 19 yo and so are most of my friends. I have two friend groups, one that is all guys and one that is a mix of boys and girls. My problem revolves around my guy friends, let\u2019s call them Jack, and Alex I\u2019ve known both of them for 3 years now. And my female friends I\u2019ll call them Ruby and Sarah. Okay now to the problem. For the past three or so months, Jack , Alex and I have been meeting up more. Typically though, Jack would be on his phone. I always ask Jack what he\u2019s doing and he just ignores me and puts his phone away. I looked over at his phone a few weeks ago and he was texting Ruby and Sarah, the reason I was able to tell was because I saw the names and contact photos. I try not to look over at peoples texts but for Jack I was confused what he was doing on his phone while he was with Alex and I so I just glanced over. After seeing him texting and seeing the same contact photos again and again. I knew he was just texting them. Now Jack can do whatever he wants, but he is literally physically with his friends. But instead of talking to us or being social he\u2019s looking down at his phone and texting Ruby and Sarah. This is a constant thing that always happens when he\u2019s around almost anyone. This is a new thing too. Jack has also started to become rude and  condescending when he talks to us, diminishing accomplishments and skills. I was thinking about talking to Jack either irl or over call to talk about how he\u2019s treating us and what he does while he\u2019s around us.

It was a very hot and humid day; and I'm not very tolerant of hot/humid weather. I was okay with everything we did outside, though near the end, I was exhausted from the heat. \n\nAfterwards, we walked to a restaurant where we had lunch reservations. Unfortunately, my father had booked a patio table outdoors. I wasn't comfortable with this, because it was hot outside, and I knew I'd be miserable the entire time. I mentioned I'd be more comfortable if we ate indoors. I tried not to make it a big deal, and kept it to a casual \"could we maybe eat inside?\". \n\nHe got us a table indoors. \n\nI was really grateful for this. But once we were seated, he wouldn't talk to me. His lip was pursed, and he didn't look at me; he just intently looked at his menu. He was doing everything possible to give me the cold shoulder. I tried to make small talk, but he didn't even nod or look up. My sister, meanwhile, just looked at us. I asked both of them if we could talk about something, because it was really quiet. Total silence.\n\nI've had outings like this before with my family. When my parents were still together, since my mom has BPD, and my dad is... Like this, the outings always ended in yelling between them, with my sister and I the audience. This lunch situation triggered me because of that. So I stood up and said, \"you know what; I'll leave, you guys have lunch and I'll get something else\" in a brusque way, and left. And I guess I was hoping, if I was gone, my dad and sister would have a better time. It was better if I wasn't there, feeling as volatile as I felt.\n\nBut... Wow. When I returned to the hotel, my father texted me, berating me for \"ruining the outing\". He texted, \"you're a grown woman, but if you want to act like a baby, you'll be treated like one\". I texted my sister, asking what was going on. No reply. I didn't see either of them again, before I flew back home. \n\nA week after the incident, I called my sister. She didn't answer, so I sent her an apology, saying I was sorry for how I behaved. None of the \"I'm sorry you didn't like this\" fake nonsense; it was a genuine message about how I understood I threw a wrench into things. I didn't believe I was completely in the wrong; I wasn't responsible for my father's reaction. But I knew my sister could've perceived the entire sequence of events, including our father's behaviour and what happened after, as my doing. So I felt the mature thing to do was apologize anyway. \n\nShe never replied. Still hasn't. \n\nThis has been eating away at me ever since. Initially, I didn't think I was being an asshole, but my sister's reaction has been calling that into question. I feel horrible, but I don't want to blame myself unnecessarily.

While in the office I prefer to call him \"David\". I do this because 1 not everyone knows I'm his daughter at first (we don't look alike) and so I refer to him as everyone else does for clarity. The 2nd reason is that often when I want his attention it's to ask a question, so the inflection is at the end of the word. It feels a lot more comfortable to say 'David?' across the office than \"Daaaaad?\" which feels very whiny and childlike to me. I'm the only female in the whole company and one of very few young people, I work with a lot of older men and have to meet with a lot of grey haired investors in suits, so I worry a lot about now coming across as too young and female, and having to say \"Dad\" often just makes me cringe.  \nHe doesn't like this, but I'm honestly not sure why. We don't have much of a father-daughter relationship (not for lack of trying on my part) as he's just not an emotional, talkative or affectionate guy. Our business relationship is probably the best type of relationship we've ever had. This is also the reason he hasn't explained to me why he doesn't like it, just told me he doesn't like it the way Alan Sugar would. He doesn't understand why I don't want to call him dad, although I have tried to explain that it's to do with coming across as professional. I also want everyone at the company to be treated the same and so don't want to call attention to the fact I am different.

The other caretaker is part of a program and seems very apathetic towards him. No other ones are available in my town. His joints are damaged beyond recovery and he can't even walk around or shower without assistance.\n\nIn the house that I live in, I take care of my step brother. The financial situation between my stepmom and I is stable, but not recently due to issues I will explain further.\n\nMy stepmother has been helping my father around his house and bringing him to physical therapy appointments when she can. She does deal with insomnia herself and falls asleep for whole days at times. The father does have an 'alternative medicine' addiction(The white stuff, not sure if I can specify here), but my mother absolutely does not use this supply. It costs about $100 a 'medicine' shot\n\nThe problem lies with the budget, where the addiction depleted her entire savings (about $6k), but she feels compelled to make her father happy. Understandably so as she is the only blood relative that visits him anymore.\n\nThe bills have become an issue due to this and she cut the medicine budget almost completely (maybe once a month). Her savings are recovering, but not enough to get a second reliable vehicle within this year, due to bills increasing for the fall/winter.\n\nI myself would not have an issue with this if not for emergency situations where I cannot reach her through phone (She becomes a heavy sleeper after insomnia nights) a stomach ache I had woke me up to possible situationa where I myself can be sick with no way to reach a hospital. An ambulance would destroy what is left in our savings as well (thanks America)\n\nI buy groceries for myself and the house weekly, which would not be a problem if I had easier transportation as the father's house is about 3 miles away from my house. My brother is more susceptible to diseases during the winter and an emergency situation might mean death if we can't bring him to an ER in time.

We used money from an inheritance. I didn't really want to buy a house with her, but she couldn't get a mortgage on her own and I knew her share of the inheritance would be wasted if she just had it sitting in her bank account, so it seemed like the best thing to do (and was also honoring the relative whose money we inherited, since he wanted to help my sister out too). \n\nWe found a house we could afford, saw a lawyer and got a contract drawn up. She seemed happy with the contract, signed it no problem, etc. All went fine. She moved in and lived there relatively happily for nearly two years. Then she met a man in another town, many hours drive away, and decided to move in with him. She didn't tell me she was moving...just upped and left. This was nearly two years ago, and the house has been largely empty since then, other than a few random friends of hers who she's had to house-sit occasionally.  \n\nI feel like I've been quite patient and reasonable in giving her time to see if this new relationship will work (which it seems to be - they've bought a house to live in together, etc.) I would like to sell the house she no longer seems to want to live in, and an opt-out clause in our property sharing contract allows me to give her notice of my intention to sell, to give her the chance to buy me out of my share. (House prices in this area have nearly doubled since we purchased the house). She wants to keep the house as a rental, but I don't. Neither of us live within 5 hours drive of where the house is, and I have no interest in being a landlord, plus I have a large mortgage of my own that I would like to be able to pay off partially. I've expressed to her, on a number of occasions, that it's my wish to exit the agreement, but she thinks I'm being selfish, 'forcing' her to sell 'her' house. If she needed it to live in, I wouldn't be considering selling my share, but since she doesn't, I would rather have my money back.

MIL started complaining about everything and she was upset at my wife for missing a family dinner (we both had to work and it was just a normal dinner nothing special). Finally it happened, she looked over at my wife and called her fat and told her she would never fit into her wedding dress. My wife immediately started crying and before my MIL could continue, I exploded. I put myself between my wife and MIL, cursed her multiple times. I was furious. I told her she would ever say that to my wife again, IDGAF who she was. I never gave her the opportunity to speak, and she immediately backed down (I assume because no one had ever challenged her before?)

Kate and I get on well together. Enough so that i feel comfortable sharing my clothes with her. Point to be noted, it has always been me lending my clothes to her and never the other way around, though that has never been an issue.\n\n  The story:\n   I had bought two new outfits to wear to upcoming events; Im an Indian and these were heavy traditional indian wear. Due to some circumstances, I had to leave them at my fianc\u00e9's home. They were to be picked-up by me in a week's time.\n\n   Every evening, my babe and I vid call each other and he's usually sitting in the family room. While i was on call with him, i saw the main door open and in walks Kate wearing one of my new outfits. I was surprised. She saw me on the vid call and her expression was priceless - caught red-handed. Even then, she did not apologize for what she did. I didnt make a big issue out of it then, because i thought it's a one-time curiosity driven thing.\n\n   Then, a few days later, she send me pictures of a few new outfits she had bought for herself, and she was also partially in the pictures  -  wearing my other new outfit. I became quite irritated then that she had the nerve to wear both of them, without my permission. And im pretty sure if i hadnt caught her in the video call as well the pics, she never would have told me what she did.\n\n   Then i texted her that i felt uncomfortable that she was wearing my new outfits and to hand over both the outfits to her brother, and I left it at that. She made her excuses but I was pretty irritated with her by then, so I didnt respond.\n\n   I then asked my babe if he could get them dry-cleaned before i came to pick them up (I was actually out of state and by the time i returned, there would have been no time for dry-cleaning as the first event was on the evening of my return) and naturally, he asked me why. I told him what happened (he knew about the first outfit as he saw it himself) and he then went and asked his sister about it. She lied to him and said that she had only worn the one he had seen her wear, and the other one, she was just \"trying it on\". My babe told me what she said but I clarified the situation and even forwarded him the pics proving so, and that's when he got a little irritated with her. \n\n    Later on, my to-be MIL called me and asked me what happened, so I told her. But I also said that it had been taken care of and not to pursue the matter any further. She had no idea that Kate had gone into her closet and taken the outfits.\n\n   After returning and going to their home to pick-up the dresses, i was treated coldly by Kate and told that her brother and mother had berated her, because of me.\n\nAITA?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1630659021.0, "author_fullname": "PreferenceQueasy3238", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ph1amc/aita_for_creating_possible_tension_between_sil/"}, {"title": "AITA for making my brother do some of my chores?", "content": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI \\[f17\\] do 90% of the chores in my house.

But we worked very hard, came in early, got a 100 percent every time on the tests and when class ended last week, he announced that our group had won with more than 180 points, and would be receiving vouchers.\n\nToday he informs the wa group that every one is receiving the same value vouchers, even though our group won. Another member and I pointed out as nice as we could that we won, and worked extra hard to win and perhaps we could receive more? He shuts us down, says its all for fun and we shouldn't deprive the other group.\n\n\nSo I replied that if we had known that at the beginning, we wouldn't have played to win, but only to learn. W have nothig against them being rewarded, but hay it should have been clear from the beginning. And to please inform future classes from the start that everyone receives the same prizes at the end. But will let it go as he requested. \n\nSo he replies very pointedly that it's my principles, not his. And that he's cancelling the contest for future classes.\n\nEveryone's in shock now, and I feel awful. But I was just standing up for my team, who all felt that it was unfair. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1630664620.0, "author_fullname": "ArwenandEowyn", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ph2fd4/aita_for_asking_for_more_prizes_for_my_team/"}, {"title": "Who\u2019s more in the wrong?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630664979.0, "author_fullname": "artheart555", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ph2i46/whos_more_in_the_wrong/"}, {"title": "AITA for calling my brother an Ass?", "content": "Me a (25F) called my brother (14M) an ass he wouldn't take care of our dying mother (43F).

It\u2019s a celebratory event and we\u2019re walking back to our hotel when I come across a storefront with a very unique smell.

Let\u2019s fucking go.\u201d\n\nI instinctively told him to fuck himself\u2014and he replied in the same manner. I was so shocked.

While cleaning out his room, I found a binder of his Pok\u00e9mon cards that he collected as a child. My aunt and I called the uncle and I asked if I could have the cards. I vaguely remember him being slightly hesitant, but he agreed. I did not beg and I understood if he wanted to keep them, but he said it was fine for me to have them. I was 10 years old at the time and very into Pok\u00e9mon. I loved these cards and have still enjoy them to this day, as I love all things Nintendo related. Jump to 10 years later...\n\nAbout 9 months ago, my younger cousins (Aunt 2\u2019s kids) asked about the cards. They\u2019re about 10 and into Pok\u00e9mon as well. I\u2019m sure my uncle mentioned that I had them, so they started asking me about them every time I saw them. They desperately wanted the cards. I would keep that at bay by saying that I wasn\u2019t sure where they were at the moment, as I just underwent a big move and they could be in any number of boxes. I don\u2019t see them very often (every few months or so) so I was hoping they would just forget it and move on. \n\nSomething to note: these kids are incredibly spoiled. I am not sure if they have ever NOT gotten their way. They\u2019re parents make good money and they are spoiled. The older of the two is pretty disrespectful as well. At my grandfathers birthday, I had gifted him a small toy vending machine filled with his favorite candy. One of the kids did not see him open this gift and when he saw the candy vending machine later, he claimed that it was his. He said, deadpan, \u201chey, give me my vending machine back. It\u2019s mine\u201d, to my grandfather. This is an example of their behavior. \n\n\nI started getting texts from the uncle about them, and I gave the same reply. I wasn\u2019t sure where the cards were. I get messages from a few other family members as well, and it was starting to get really annoying at that point. The family went on a long road trip together (I did not go, I\u2019m busy with school) and reportedly talked about me and the cards for a majority of the trip. The family started conspiring against me, saying that I sold the cards and was lying to them. I got a few more rude messages about it from family members. After this, I decided to go looking for the cards. I found them, but do not want to give them up. They were given to me, I\u2019ve had them for a decade and I still enjoy them, so why should I? I would rather burn them then give them to my cousins, honestly.\n\nI admitted this to my grandparents, and I\u2019m sure word has gotten around by now.\n\nIf my uncle wanted them back and I was sure he wouldn\u2019t give them to the cousins, I would give them back. They are apart of his childhood after all.

For example S would always hog the family things like Xbox, computer ect. S berated me for thinking about dating this guy, S slept with him a couple weeks later. I couldn't do anything without her like go out with friends, S wanted to go to college after I got in and fell pregnant \"accidentally\" 3 months after I discovered I was pregnant. Albeit S was in a relationship of 2 years, except he'd made it clear he did not want kids yet. S also hated when I met my now fiance, as I spent more time with him.\n\nI realised just how selfish S was when I discovered she was in 20k of gambling debt and made M a guarantor for some it. After that I started to distance myself but we still stayed with our parents so it was hard. I later found out she stole M and D's savings while M was battling lung cancer. The cancer unfortunately spread to M's brain and became terminal. I was the one who mainly took care of M, despite being pregnant, I cooked, cleaned, made time to sit with her even if it was just watching the TV, we even made a blanket together for my son (S was supposed to help make one for N but wanted me and M to do it instead). I also made sure M had all her medication. While S used to go for groceries, paid the bills ect. S barely spent anytime with M and even put in to move out when M had her lung cancer (she moved out a month before my mum passed). After my mum had passed we discovered S was sending money to herself. S claimed it was to pay for the bills and groceries but she had M's bank card so would have used that. I also discovered my auntie had sent M money to help out but S stole that too. \n\nIn march this year I discovered, after being arrested by the HMRC, that S had been using mine and M's name to make fraudulent self assessment tax claims, to the sum of 160k. This was the absolute last straw and I went no contact. We now have reason to suspect she tried to steal Ds self assessment as his account was put under investigation and he's not had any tax returns in a couple years. S used to do them for D and I think this is how S got the idea.\n\nNow, S has a few mental health issues and has used that as an excuse for any wrong doings in the past. S also kept blaming M for alot of the money going missing, saying M told her to take it. We are struggling to believe this. \n\nI told all of our friends about what S done and most went NC aswell. S had her son in Dec last year and ended up with post natal.  I don't even feel bad that I've essentially helped alienate her and this is where I think I could be the asshole. I feel nothing.

We've been together for over  years, and have been living together for 2 years. He's always been extremely social which I loved when we met. I used to be super social as well. Ever since moving in together it's been a 1 step forward 2 steps back situation.\n\nSo for the first year we lived together he was working part time, only doing about 10 hours a week. During which time he'd spend 3 or 4 days and, sometimes nights, of every week with his friends or family. Mostly family.\nHe's always been super close with his family and vice versa (he's lived with them for most of his life til he turned 24, and even his sister who is early 30s with 2 kids still lives at home, and I can guarantee my partner would be on the same track if he didn't move in with me, or had a partner who actually got along with his family)\n\nNow that we're on our second year of living together where he's been working full time for the most part, doing 6 days a week of 12 hour shifts, he's gone even more. In the last 2 weeks for example, he's only come home straight after work about 4 times,  every other time he's gone to his families house where he won't come home until 9 or 10pm, 2 nights a week he'll stay the night at his families home. The one day he has off each week doesn't fall on my days off (I work full time as well) so I'll literally only see him for 2 or 3 hours a day if I'm lucky. For the last 3 months he's probably been home a total of 3 weeks... 3 weeks Where's actually come home straight after work or actually spend his day off at home.\n\nAnd because of all of the above, it's then left to me to do the cleaning or making sure the bills are paid or making sure we (mostly me) has dinner cooked/sorted, or making sure our house has food and the necessities. He wants kids but how do you expect to have kids when you're gone more than you're home? We're meant to be saving to buy a house, but how can we even commit to buying a home together when he's not home? \n\nAnd because of all of the above I'm absolutely beginning to dislike his family and his friends. Any time his family or friends need something from him or want to see him, he'll drop everything to go hang out. But then if I'm breaking down (this has caused so many disagreements) or need help with something home related and he's out, I'll be lucky to get a text back, let alone him rushing home. I feel like I'm the last priority as he spends so much time and energy on and with others, that when he does finally come home, he has no energy for me. \n\nAnd I don't get along with or particularly like some of his immediate family/friends and vice versa, it makes it so easy to resent them and want nothing to do with them. Especially when they ask so much of him or expect him to be so present in their lives, when they won't put in nearly as much time or effort or energy into being there when he/we need. But they don't mind asking him, and in turn me, for things.\n\nSo, Am I the ass hole for resenting his social life?

We were always a bit rocky but it was easily one of the strongest either of us had been in. There were numerous times where we had both begged the other not to leave but this last time it was me.\n\nThe first time was around this time last year when our dreams were different; they wanted kids and I didn\u2019t, so they tried to break up. I changed my mind though and after a lot of hard work we made up. We were great again until winter, when I fell into depression and didn\u2019t exactly want to be in a relationship. I was pretty ashamed that I had just gotten them interested again only to lose it myself, which is odd because I\u2019m not usually that self aware. I approached them first and they were understanding but as I continued to feel nothing, I suggested breaking up; I was just convinced they deserved someone better. They begged me to stay, which is understandable given I begged them to the first time. This went on for months as I recovered, and they kept insisting I ignore my gut, and over time I had to condition myself to do so and stay with them no matter what, despite how unhealthy that sounds. Slowly, I recovered and started to feel closer to them than I ever had. It was around this time, just before the trouble began, that I started planning to move to the same city as them.\n\nWe were going really strong near the end and I thought we were finally in an okay place. I felt a lot of warmth and affection from them and they claimed I had given them the same. Then, out of nowhere, they went silent and a week later told me that it was over. Their reason keeps changing, from distance to wanting to find themselves to not wanting to be in ANY relationship to petty things like the fact I\u2019m a neat freak and they\u2019re messy. They assured me that loving me was never the problem though, and I trust them when they say it\u2019s not because of someone else.\n\nThey had told me that work gets really hard for them each summer (and believe me it was) and an idea clicked in my head that, since we almost separated around the same time last year, that this was seasonal and like my depression. I kept reminding them of things they said to me, such as \u201cGet on antidepressants and see if it changes.\u201d They insisted nothing I can say will change their mind. They did however ask for me to stay friends with them, as they still care deeply about me. So last weekend, when they said it was distance, I told them my plans to move closer. They called me a creep, a stalker, and that I only cared about myself. We've since made up and are still friends, and I\u2019m moving on, but after all the effort I put into staying just to make them happy only to have it thrown back at me, is it really fair to call me obsessed when they made me condition myself to not give up?

He's been a good friend and we hung out a lot before classes started with our group of friends too.\n\nOnce classes and academic work started however (note this is an intensive Masters course), I couldn't really find any energy or time, especially the past few months other than summer. I am involved in a lot more projects and clubs than he is, and I have my own part-time work to do in addition to a non-profit that I'm volunteering for. Comparatively, he deals with only the classwork and project which all of us have to do mandatorily.\n\nProblem here is that due to all the things I have on my plate, I don't really have much time left (read none). Whatever little I do have, I spend with my boyfriend who is also my best friend and goes through a lot so he needs me. My friend insists that I meet him for 10 minutes everyday since we live nearby. If I could just say Hi and leave within 5 minutes, I would, but he's a bit clingy and I don't appreciate how he teases me a lot, or quite a few other things. I respond to his messages and calls when I can, but apparently it's not soon enough for him, as I don't look at my texts often. I got really frustrated as he started speaking sarcastically about this on call even after I told him I have a meeting in 2 minutes. I said \"Fine!\" and cut the call.\n\nHe's a good guy and a good friend, but I just don't have the time or energy to meet him daily. I am content with meeting him on weekends or get-togethers with friends, but it's not enough for him.\n\nI don't know if I should put in even more effort to meet him. I don't really think I can, but I'm doubting myself because of what he said. If I have to maintain this with him, I have to do the same for all my other friends who are here, and it's just not possible.\n\nAITA?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630568874.0, "author_fullname": "Initial_Coast1303", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pgd8k6/aita_my_friend_wants_to_meet_and_i_dont_have_the/"}, {"title": "WIBTA for calling my Aunt out for her behavior publicly on her social media", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630568912.0, "author_fullname": "0002niardnek", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pgd8tn/wibta_for_calling_my_aunt_out_for_her_behavior/"}, {"title": "AITA for telling my sister I won't be a part of her meeting our biological father?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1630569076.0, "author_fullname": "GurLate4750", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pgd9yd/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_wont_be_a_part_of/"}, {"title": "AITA for not caring about whether my mother is lives or dies?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630569077.0, "author_fullname": "PassengerMaterial282", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pgd9yv/aita_for_not_caring_about_whether_my_mother_is/"}, {"title": "(Repost)- AITA for asking my dad higher pay for taking out his dog?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630569183.0, "author_fullname": "Natural-Reference-50", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pgdaob/repost_aita_for_asking_my_dad_higher_pay_for/"}, {"title": "AITA for not caring about whether my mother lives or dies?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630569324.0, "author_fullname": "PassengerMaterial282", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pgdbn7/aita_for_not_caring_about_whether_my_mother_lives/"}, {"title": "AITA for selling out my friend out for a grade", "content": "English isn't my first language so sorry if I make a mistake or don't explain something very well\n\nSo recently in one of my (F17) classes, we had a test which was worth 20% of our overall grade. That usually wouldn't be an issue but I performed really bad on the test (I barely passed with 52%) and my overall grade took a big hit (went from a comfortable A to a low B). Luckily, since a lot of other kids in my class didn't do too good either, our teacher is giving us another assignment and said she will grade us based on whichever test we get a higher score on. Naturally I want to do very well on this new assignment so my overall grade won't be heavily effected.\n\nWell just yesterday I was finishing my assignment (it's on paper) while discussing it with a friend (M17) when suddenly he snatched my paper and started reading it. I was a bit annoyed but at the same time he was only reading it so I didn't say anything or try to get it back, but when he did finish reading it, he ripped it into pieces and told me that I could've made it much better.\n\nI was so angry at him because the assignment was due at the end of that day (and he knew this) and unfortunately for me I did not have a draft or copy of it on my laptop to hand in instead (I don't think he knew though). I didn't say anything to him at the time because I was too panicked so instead I just took the pieces he ripped and tried (heavy emphasis on \"Tried\") to tape my work back together. For the rest of the day I pretty much just spent it trying to rewrite my assignment but I was nowhere near done by the time I had to give it in so instead I just gave the teacher my ruined paper.\n\nShe was extremely upset at me and asked if I thought the class was a joke to be handing assignments in like that. At that point I was really stressed and panicked so instead of making up excuses I just told her the truth that my friend ruined it. Luckily she believed me and allowed me some extra time to hand in the assignment (I handed it in today after spending the rest of yesterday and this morning rewriting it). My friend however wasn't so lucky and he ended up getting a weeks worth of after school detention which is really bad for him because he also has after school activities.\n\nI've received a few messages from him and his friends saying about how I really screwed him over and should not have sold him out like that over one assignment. I didn't really think about it at first but after reading the messages I started feeling bad because it is true that it was just one assignment and I maybe could've made up for it later.

I'm a single mother (42F) and I have a son (15M) and his grandfather (78M) live in the house, with two bedrooms. I take one of the bedrooms, and they share the other bedroom. The beds are equal in size, just to add information. So recently I have been noticing that my son stays up way too late, often up to 1 am at night (1 or 1:15 at max).

As you can imagine, I think it has a negative effect on her psyche; she makes voodoo dolls of people at work, draws magic circles, and the like. She also has really sporadic moods as sometimes she's really positive, while other times she'll threaten to lightning the house out of existence (which I think is a wizard thing but ok). \n\nSome of the things she comes up with shocks me outright. One time, she kept period blood from like a year ago and mixed it with wine, honey, and glue so she could use it to draw a circle. The reason she did this was because she thought she could convert a guy to a state of \u201csemi-infancy\u201d and that he would return to his moms womb. A recent incident is when she woke me up in the middle of the night, asking me to give her an undercut so she could get a \u201craam-ma'am\u201d tattoo on her scalp, but then she panicked and changed her mind because she said cutting too much long hair at once would damage her lifeforce because it was enchanted.\n\nNow to the present. Yesterday, we were watching tv during dinner and a news story about how some mom abandoned her kid in a car came on. Daughter made a nasty remark about how she thought mom would have done that to her if she got the chance. I told her that was rude and she murmured an apology. So I thought things were good until I woke up for work and found her drawing a magic circle in the back yard, which she said would curse moms soul and make her afterlife tedious.\n\nSo I grounded her. The terms were no iphone (she can use a flipphone for emergency when going out) and no reddit or twitter for a week, and no playing witch until she apologizes about the situation. She screamed and is crying in her room right now.\n\nThe reason I came here today is because I am wondering if I am assholish for the punishment. She is old enough to live on her own but she suffers with disability (which I will not disclose for safety reasons) and I don't think she will do very well with the state she's in. I want to have a good relationship with daughter and I am scared this witch stuff will hurt not only the relationship, but her life in the long run. So I don't want to come off as mean to her.

This lead to a MASSIVE blow up of their friendship to the point where the Prev manager left specifically because she couldn't stand to work with the 2IC as the 2IC started slacking off when they'd work together, the 2IC was calling in sick often, they wouldnt talk, and the 2IC had been rumored to be having people in store after hours doing sexual things (no one to this day knows if this is true or not as there's no proof, only rumors) but no disciplinary actions were taken against the 2IC for any of the above, so the PM (Previous Manager) left.\n\nCut to a couple months later, I've taken over the store and am working with the 2IC. She pulled her weight and was a really strong worker while working with me. We were still having some issues with her absences (calling in sick once every few weeks) but she had potential. I found her to be really strong, despite the absences (which we addressed). 4 months into me running this store, our company is looking for a store manager for another location.

When we first arrived here (back in July) neither of us spoke or knew any Spanish, but now that we've been here for almost 2 months I've picked up the language and she hasn't, I've also made some friends through dating apps which she is doubtful of, so she doesn't really know anyone here except me and our co-workers that she doesn't communicate with outside of work.\n\nThe main problem right now is that we both have our birthdays in September - hers is on Sunday and mine is on Thursday for which we asked to have two consecutive days off from work for both of them and our boss made it happen. *For anyone who doesn't know Spain - just a tad bit of information - on Sundays almost everything is closed, mostly only restaurants are open and the party day for clubs and bars is on Thursday for some reason.*\n\nThe point of this post is - I asked her if she has any plans for her birthday yesterday (Wednesday) around 2:30 pm and she said not really, as she doesn't know anyone in here and she just wants to go out for dinner. I was a bit surprised, but I get it as most places are closed, but I thought that she might want to hang out or something, but she didn't say anything about it. So I made plans with my friends here - one's that she hasn't met and are from 1.5h car drive or 3h by bus, away - and they confirmed that, yeah we can go to their rural house Saturday after I'm done at work to hang out, play some games, stargaze and I could meet their dog (an adorable 4-year-old wolfdog that I've yet to meet due to the transportation reasons).\n\nHere's the kicker - She texted me at 8 pm, telling me that we are going out on Saturday evening. Not asking, just informing me that we're going out. But I already made plans to go out of the city for a day-and-a-half, because when I asked (before I made plans) she said she only wants to go out for dinner on Sunday.\n\nAm I in the wrong for not staying in the city we live in, just to go out with her?

I was disappointed but not surprised.\n\nCut to the current problem. I was talking to my brother a few nights ago on the phone and he was asking me some questions about my autism and I was very happy to talk to him about. He had never shown an interest in understanding before.\n\nSo I explained about my outbursts when I was younger and what was going on through my head and he scoffed. I asked him what\u2019s wrong and he said \u2018that\u2019s not autism you\u2019re just an asshole, you\u2019ve always been an asshole. Still are.\u2019 \n\nI was speechless.\n\nI have been told that getting frustrated at the world because I don\u2019t understand it is very normal and outbursts can happen. It obviously doesn\u2019t excuse being a straight up asshole and now I can\u2019t help but think that my brother is right.\n\nLike I said I really struggle with this kind of stuff and maybe I\u2019m just not understanding again so I need someone to tell me if I\u2019m an asshole so I can work on not being an asshole.", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1630573357.0, "author_fullname": "lostnconfused00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pge3d2/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_family_when_i_dont/"}, {"title": "AITA for not wanting to pay interest on a loan from my boyfriend.", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630573634.0, "author_fullname": "Either_Evidence9856", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pge58c/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_interest_on_a_loan/"}, {"title": "AITA for not talking to my mom about finding porn on my phone?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630573758.0, "author_fullname": "nuub96", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pge63i/aita_for_not_talking_to_my_mom_about_finding_porn/"}, {"title": "AITA for touching my crush's hair?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630573851.0, "author_fullname": "Fantastic-Mistake744", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pge6r5/aita_for_touching_my_crushs_hair/"}, {"title": "AITA for not talking to my mom about porn she found on my phone", "content": "I (15m) woke up today and noticed my phone is gone and I didn't care at first because I thought I must've misplaced it and forgot. Then I left my room to get some water and my mom said this to me  \"Are you going to ask why I took your phone?\". I asked her why and she said \"I found something inappropriate and I want you to stand there and figure it out.\". I sat next her and asked why was she looking through my phone. Her response was \"I told you to stand there.\". It took me 10 seconds to realize what this was about. But I didn't want to talk to her about because we've had this conversation before. So two years ago she found porn on my phone and ripped into me about it. She was saying every girl in there was drugged and forced into it. Then said I'm  a disgusting person and she's disappointed at me for looking at it. I was punished for awhile and she brought it up every time she could. Im not going to play dumb I know the porn industry is a disgusting thing but I'm not against porn as a whole. When she was talking to me about she was acting like I was looking for and hoping  that the woman in the videos were being forced into it.  So back to the present I stood there for about 40 minutes and she said  \"Are you gonna stand there all night.\" and I said \"I don't know.\". She started calling me stubborn so I tried telling her I know what she saw I don't feel comfortable talking about it. She asked if I was embarrassed so then I specified I don't want to talk about it with her. She didn't say anything for 30 minutes. She than explained to me how she found it and tried to tell me she wasn't snooping through my phone, I didn't believe her. Her explanation was that she needed me to do something so she went into my room and I was asleep and she noticed a YouTube video was playing and she said she wanted to turn the video off. She said since she didn't have a Samsung she didn't know how to turn the phone off so she shut every app off on my phone one by one. She just so happened to open up Bing and saw porn on there. I know her well enough to know she is not that technologically inept to be unaware on how to turn off a phone. She said if she wanted to look through my she could do it anytime. I was confused because she thought this would make believe her. So she left to go into her room and I was still not allowed to leave so I stood there for a hour. So by the time she left her room she was tired of me standing there so she said why aren't you talking to me and I shrugged my shoulders  and she went up close to me and said \"If you wanna fight we can right now.\". She was tired of seeing me stand and called me a bad son and told me to go to my ro om.\n\nSorry for the long post also I don't really care who responds to this post but I would appreciate if a woman could give her opinion because I want to make sure there isn't something I don't understand about the porn thing cause I'm a man.\n\nAITA?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630573951.0, "author_fullname": "nuub96", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pge7ek/aita_for_not_talking_to_my_mom_about_porn_she/"}, {"title": "WIBTA for leaving my mom right after her mom died?", "content": "a bit of context: in 2014 my (24f) mom and stepdad separated a month after my mom\u2019s dad died. she hates him for that and feels that my stepdad should\u2019ve given her grace to grieve her dad\u2019s death before leaving.\n\nanother bit of context: when i was 19, i mentioned moving on campus and my mom, who was having financial issues at the time, felt like i was abandoning her to handle a shit situation on her own. she gave me the silent treatment for a day. since then i\u2019ve made it my mission to put my mom and my 13 year old sister in a financially stable position so that i won\u2019t feel guilty when i move out. i\u2019ve put in more than enough work to improve our financial situation, at one point i was solely supporting us for almost two years. i never mentioned moving out again until the incident in question a few days ago.\n\nmy grandma recently died, and my mom and i took care of her for a year at home and for several years before. the only reason i hadn\u2019t moved out was to help my mom out financially as well as help carry some of the weight of caregiving. i mentioned to my mom that since grandma has died, i thought it might be a good idea to change my surroundings a bit and get a fresh start after having been a caregiver for so long, plus it\u2019s hard for me to stay in the same house that my grandma died in. i offhandedly mentioned moving on campus next semester. her words to me exactly were:\n\n\u201cso you\u2019re really gonna leave me right after my mom has died? it\u2019s like thomas (my stepdad) all over again.\u201d\n\nshe thought about what she said for a second and said nevermind and tried to laugh it off, but i know those are her true feelings. would it be wrong for me to leave her when i\u2019m mirroring a traumatic event that happened to her before?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630574100.0, "author_fullname": "bacchanaliaa", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pge8ds/wibta_for_leaving_my_mom_right_after_her_mom_died/"}, {"title": "AITA for touching my crush's hair?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630574217.0, "author_fullname": "Fantastic-Mistake744", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pge996/aita_for_touching_my_crushs_hair/"}, {"title": "Am I the Asshole for playing Fortnite in secret from my parents?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630574779.0, "author_fullname": "XX_OVERLORD", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pged3r/am_i_the_asshole_for_playing_fortnite_in_secret/"}, {"title": "Vaccines and health....am I the asshole?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630574780.0, "author_fullname": "swampy_panties", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pged3w/vaccines_and_healtham_i_the_asshole/"}, {"title": "AITA for playing Fortnite in secret without my parents\u2019 permission?", "content": "Would like to keep it rather short.\n\nMy parents never allow me to play gun-games, unless it\u2019s in a friend\u2019s house.

She isn't the type that goes to a lot of parties or hangs out in big friend groups.\n\n  \nAll of her close friends are girls, except for one guy. They have known eachother for about 2 years now. They actually are pretty close. They go to the gym together, they attend the same classes in school, they started a small business together and are part of the same friend group.

My girlfriend  still hangs out with him. They actually hang out about as much as me and her do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast friday they wen't to a party together and smoked/drinked there etc. I wasn't there because I was not able to make it that night (although they invited me a few hours in advance). Furthermore they sometimes just hang out with the two of them and this almost always includes drinking or smoking (weed). They go to the gym together, have classes together and even started a small business together. I was never worried about any of this, just because he had a girlfriend. In hindsight, I don't know if I was just being naive...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current situation**  \nOk so now the new school year has started, and my girlfriend is busy with an internship that takes up the whole week. So I won't be able to see her nearly as much as I used to. I live 2 hours away from her, so it is not exactly convenient to visit during the weekdays. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis upcoming friday I have a party that I was invited to, and she was invited to another party by this friend again (she said I could also come). Realistically I can't stop her from seeing him if she wants to see him, and I think it's ok for her to have friendships. It's just the change in the dynamic that has me stressing a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe positive sign for me is that she is telling me about these parties and even inviting me over to join them, so there's nothing secretive going on. And honestly I don't think she has feelings for him right now, but maybe this could change in the future if they hang out a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How I feel about it**  \n\n\nI'm just worried that if something is going on, that I need to act soon rather than later. I did notice a small change in attitude over the phone this week. I don't know whether this is because I feel insecure about the situation, or because she is just busy/st ressed out because of her internship (which she told me she is stressed about), or whether there is actually something going on between her and this guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**  \nGirlfriend of 1 year has a good \"guy friend\" that she spends a lot of time with.

I also spend a lot of time with my s/o, who lives in an other city but we're not ready to move in together yet.\n\nDespite taking a break from studying, I do work as a substitute teacher. The pay is admittedly good, but I work \"on call\" so it's not quaranteed I get to work every day, which means even the good pay can be a bit unsure. While working I stay with my parents since they live in the same city I work in, I eat the food they bought and use their water etc. I mostly work to fund my apartment since the benefits that are available to me don't entirely cover the costs.\n\nSo I came back to my parents' place a few days ago, and yesterday my mum announced that if I wanted to stay here I should pay rent, because they are tight on money. That it's unfair to them that I'm just staying with them and not contributing to anything. This kind of pissed me off. I didn't respond and just changed the subject. I'd also like to point out that I've never really asked them for anything, neither money nor clothes, makeup or anything, really. They have bought me things I need in my apartment, but I have not asked for anything.\n\nNow if I actually lived with them and spent most of my time at home, I would obviously not be opposed to it. But since I have to pay my own rent as well, I feel like what they're asking is a bit too much. My own rent is over 500 euros and they're asking me to pay up to 100 euros for food, water, toilet paper etc. It would be a completely different case if I knew I'd get to go to work every single day as well.

I live a few blocks from a beach so it\u2019s great for them and a great break for my sister and BIL. This year, before their trip I was speaking to my sister on the phone on speaker phone so the boys could hear so we could plan some activities for their trip. I had mentioned signing them up for surf lessons since they are getting a little older and they seemed ecstatic. My exact words were \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll get some surfboards and sign you guys up for lessons\u201d. When I run this by my husband later that night, he suggest that we buy a couple of boards instead of renting since we have guests often. Sounds great- cool. Or so I thought. Fast forward to the trip and we have a great two weeks, which included a trip to a theme park, clothes shopping and the before mentioned surf lessons. But- the night before they are due to leave one of my nephews asks if the surfboards will fit in the car (their parents paid they\u2019re older step brother to come pick them up). I didn\u2019t realize that when we were shopping for the surfboards they were under the impression that we were buying the surfboards specifically for them. I tried the old \u201cwe\u2019re going to have you guys keep them here so that you don\u2019t have to bring them back-and-forth\u201c but they weren\u2019t having it. The younger one said he wanted to take them home so he could show his friends and the older one said he wanted to hang his in his room. Had I known it was so important to them I would have bought two cheaper boards (there were some in the $300 range but we bought nicer ones that were almost $600 each). At the end of it all they seemed OK with the fact that they weren\u2019t able to take the boards home, that was until they got home and made a huge deal about it to my sister. She called me shortly after, and told me that I got the boys excited about owning surfboards and that I shouldn\u2019t have made a promise I didn\u2019t intend to keep. I\u2019m floored. For some context, my husband and I make significantly more money than my sister and BIL and she often jokes that its my job to spoil her kids until I decide to start a family of my own. I often pay for their expenses and I\u2019m happy to and don\u2019t want to throw that in her face but I feel like she and her children are being extremely entitled. I do feel bad for the boys that they got their hopes up but if I was a parent I would explain that it was a misunderstanding and would never expect someone to give to children $1200 worth of equipment. I\u2019m actually really annoyed that all of the fun things my husband and I took the time to plan and pay for on their trip are being completely forgotten and unappreciated, but I also don\u2019t want to be stingy.

I not only didn't mind but made it clear from day one that thats not a problem for me since I grew up in a separated household and would go into this situation providing what I can to be a good figure which I think has been pretty successful. Earlier this summer we had visited my father and his side of my family at their cottage and my gf and her daughter came along. It was a great weekend and I think we all had a lot of fun and during the course of that my step mother had said to us that her and (her/our) daughter had already been making plans to come back at the end of summer. We kept that in mind and followed through to plan another weekend this coming weekend about a month ago with my step mother and that side of my family. A few days ago we received a late call from her daughter who was excited that her biological father had planned another trip that same weekend to see his father (which in all fairness he just reunited with recently and this would be their second time going to see him).

We've now argued over this twice which ended with what I thought was her understanding why this was important to me to build a future.

It has created a rift since then and that having her there with my family isn't being taken into consideration that I'm trying to build a future and I feel like she's siding with the biological father who hasn't done much more than is required.

She said I was a wonderful husband and an amazing father. She wasn't unhappy, she thought she could be happier.\n\nAt first I believed her because I had loved her so much. But reality is that when she had first seen her old friend after 23 years, they had an immediate spark for a relationship that never really had a chance to happen. The affair had actually started right away. I know this because after 25 years of marriage, I looked at my now ex-wife's emails for the first time ever.  And the evidence in terms of the number of emails and the tone of them made it obvious the affair had been going on almost since the first day they reconnected.

They were having dinner together when all of a sudden, my ex's lover starts slurring his words and pretty much becomes despondent.  In turns out, he has depression, over-medicates and my ex sometimes just leaves the house while he sleeps for days.  She just does her own thing when he is like this. And while my ex claims this has not happened often, obviously it happens enough that she has a routine for when he is like this.\n\nAs I had noted, I have had bottled up anger about the betrayal and lying until my daughter told me this. And now that I have a new partner, and knowing that my wife's partner is a mess, I found that my anger literally melted away. I am kind of gloating inside over this.

But if he keeps bringing this up, we will either get divorced or I\u2019ll become old and bitter and act like he is doing now. \n\nI don\u2019t get it. He keeps on telling me to take my time, that health comes first. Right now, I have 0 in my bank account. I ask him if I need anything, and I have never asked for anything unnecessary, like a more expensive nice dress or so. Only what I need to live on a daily basis.\n\n If I wanted to leave for the day because I\u2019m so fed up with this I couldn\u2019t, because I neither have friends here, nor a single dime.

They didn't see each other much, as he lived very far away, but this was an unrequited relationship for both of them so email and text was enough.\n\nWhen she left me, she claimed that they had been just friends for the last 18 months and only in the last month had they decided they should try to be together.  She said I was a wonderful husband and an amazing father. She wasn't unhappy, she thought she could be happier.\n\nAt first I believed her because I had loved her so much. But reality is that when she had first seen her old friend after 23 years, they had an immediate spark for a relationship that never really had a chance to happen. The affair had actually started right away. I know this because after 25 years of marriage, I looked at my now ex-wife's emails for the first time ever.  Given the number of emails and the tone of them, it was obvious the affair had been going on almost since the first day they reconnected.  When I confronted her, of course she lied and said it wasn't true. She continued to gaslight me until I finally stopped talking to her.\n\nIt is now two years later.  I have moved on and have a new partner who is amazing.  And while I quickly got over loving my wife, I had not fully gotten past my anger at the betrayal and all of the lying. But this past week, my oldest daughter went to visit her mother and meet my ex-wife's lover for the first time. They were having dinner together when all of a sudden, my ex's lover starts slurring his words and pretty much becomes despondent.  In turns out, he has depression over medicates and my ex sometimes just leaves the house while he sleeps for days.  She just does her own thing when he is like this. And while my ex claims this has not happened often, obviously it happens enough that she has a routine for when he is like this.\n\nAs I had noted, I have had bottled up anger about the betrayal and lying until my daughter told me this. And now that I have a new partner, and knowing that my wife's partner is a mess, I found that my anger literally melted away. I am kind of gloating inside over this.  I can't help but feel that karma is a bitch and that my ex-wife deserves this pain in her life for all the pain she caused me for the betrayal and gaslighting.\n\nAm I an asshole for feeling good about how everything turned out great for me, and it has turned out poorly for my ex?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630481646.0, "author_fullname": "CodComplete2216", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pfoyq2/aita_because_my_cheating_wifes_situation_turned/"}, {"title": "AITA for being suicidal", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630481985.0, "author_fullname": "Shadowbirbs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pfp14n/aita_for_being_suicidal/"}, {"title": "AITA for telling my friend he never made a good decision in his life?", "content": "Tl;Dr - I got sick of watching my friend make bad decision after bad decision and lashed out. I'm aware I was harsh but I'm not convinced I was wrong to do it.\n\nI have been friends with R for close to 10 years, we're both in our 30s. He is an absolute sweetheart but struggles with general life skills and doesn't have much common sense. He has a lot of childhood trauma and severe ADHD which may explain this. He's only a couple of years younger than me but he often seems like a little kid.\n\nDuring the time I've known him, I have watched him make bad decision after bad decision and apparently never learn from his mistakes. Most of his worst decisions are about relationships. He has been mistreated by every partner he's ever had and I probably don't even know half of it since he always tries to act like it isn't happening. He lets people treat him like crap then he gets confused because it keeps happening. He's said he doesn't understand what's wrong with him, in my opinion it's incredibly obvious how vulnerable and defenceless he is so of course he's going to attract that type of person. I imagine most decent people wouldn't feel comfortable starting a relationship with him because they would be concerned about taking advantage. He's said before that he doesn't feel like he deserves to be treated well which honestly just seems like self pity and an excuse to avoid changing. Of course I sympathise and do my best to support him but it becomes infuriating after a while and I admit I have lost my temper with him.\n\nThe current argument happened a few days back when R was buzzing about a new man he's seeing despite still being traumatised by the last one. I suggested it might be a good idea to take a break from dating, he said he had planned to but this man felt really \"right\". I said something along the lines of \"Well you haven't made a smart decision the entire time I've known you, so why start now?\" I do get that this was harsh, but to put it in context - the last time R had a bad break up, he ended up sleeping with his 60-something year old therapist less than a week later and completely spiralled . He does not do the standard silly rebound stuff and I'm sick of our friends acting like his behaviour is totally normal and I'm \"judging\" him for expressing concern.\n\nI have apologised for my tone but not for what I said, because honestly I don't think I'm wrong. Our mutual friends are all giving me the cold shoulder and R is upset but I'm sick of everyone acting like his behaviour is fine when it clearly isn't.

So, most of us are working 6 days a week with the occasional 12-hour shift to cover. All of our scheduling is done by our regional manager, who also oversees ~20 other posts. I am apparently the only person who has not been scheduled for any overtime for almost a month, and everyone else at the post is apparently \"very unhappy with this\" according to one of the other guards. I have no idea why. i still work full time and we have no part-time people at the post.\n\nI am not opposed to overtime. I have worked 60-hour weeks here and never complained because I like the extra cash. I would not be opposed to it if our manager put me on for some. I have turned down overtime less than 5 times since I have worked here (almost a year). I just don't question my schedule, and I can't even know anyone else's without asking them. Talking to the guard I mentioned above, he said that everyone thinks I'm lazy and unwilling to support the team. I said I would work more if it was given to me, I do feel guilty that everyone was putting in more days than me, but I have no idea why I have not been put on for overtime.\n\nThen he asked me why I haven't called our manager to request more overtime. I told him that I don't owe that the team, nor do they owe me covering my shifts if I call off. Since our boss never brings anyone over to our post and is too incompetent to hire anyone new, if we are understaffed and no one can cover a shift, and that jeopardizes our contract with the client, that responsibility falls on our manager, not us. I said \"is it suddenly my job to make sure my schedule pleases everyone else? Take it up with [manager], I didn't do this. I have worked overtime before and would again. [manager] ought to know that since I rarely turn it down.\" Then I told him that someone else could just say \"no\" to overtime, if they're tired of working so much, and I would cover their shift no questions asked.

But this year he has begun to take issues with my \"lack of humility\" and taking issue with my answers to questions in college tutorials and lectures, as well as interject into inside jokes I am making with other people who find them funny, whilst he doesn't and gets offended. He also now accuses me of being a womaniser which is very very far from the truth.\n\nAbout his problems with my \"humility\", I am a confident person and do not have a problem with making friends, casually talking to people and taking a leadership role, a trait which I didn't have before and worked hard towards. He on the other hand has self esteem issues that I have been there to listen in on and give my support but has unloaded on me for any sense of doubt I have in myself because according to him it \"makes him feel bad because I am better than him\".\n\nFor a period of time, I was afraid to make jokes or act witty in social situations, or ask questions in class because I knew he would instantly take issue with it. I feel like this is borderline abuse on his part.\n\nNOW, going to present day, I have been using business terms to refer to my virtual birthday party (such as calling my birthday call a \"conference\" and joking about people such as Doja Cat and Harry Styles attending), which have been giving my friends a laugh and having people engage in more communications.

We do stuff like oral pretty often and both enjoy it but we didn't have actual sex. We both said to each other that we really want to start it again but I guess we lost the habit of it so we just need to get back into the rhythm \n\nNow the issue is that we don't want kids, and to be fair, he is more indifferent/unsure (but understands my choice and wants to rather be together than have kids, plus he told me his own reasons against kids.) From that point of view, i understand the need to provide my own protection and I'd never push him to something like getting a vasectomy. \n\nHowever what comes into play when I say I want him to use condom is sexual frequency. Since we are more into oral and are just getting into sex again, and it wasn't me withholding or anything like that, I find it very illogical to take a pill every single day which is basically hormons that will affect my body and mind, for the chance of having sex maybe once every two months. It just doesn't seem worth the effort and risk at all. I know some women take contraception regularly anyway for periods and other stuff but I have regular and easy periods and am really not eager to fuck with my hormonal balance for a rare activity. \n\nI told him very clearly that I am only talking about the initial phase, once we get back into it or have regular sex then of course things would change and wearing a condom every single time will be impractical. Then I am more than open to trying pills although I'd rather do IUD. \n\nNow IUD is my preferred choice but I can't do it easily where I'm at right now and I know it hurts like hell. I'm ready to do it but I feel like to be ready to invest the money and time into it we should at least already be having sex and it should be more than an abstract idea.\n\nI feel like all female contraception has many ups and downs and possible consequences, while he'd literally be putting something on and off for like 10-15 minutes. I get that the sensations are maybe reduced and he isn't a fan, but it seems to me that the priority now should be a  relatively low effort method to make it easy for us to focus on the actual sex, rather than a high investment method for the sake of hypothetical future sex. \n\nWe had a really big fight and he got very angry (and then I got angry in return). I thought I logically laid out the options and don't understand how his conclusion is that I should take a pill. I also  got pissed then, and told him that clearly he doesn't care about my well being or even listen to the points I'm making. I think he just knows that tons of women take the pill but when I mention the negatives to him it's me attacking him and not me laying out valid arguments, like I'm an anti-va xxer or something. \n\nAm I really so wrong and unfair about this?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630488458.0, "author_fullname": "CuntessVarga", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pfqb88/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_on_the_pill_and/"}, {"title": "AITA for feeling weird about a friend's relationship?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630488569.0, "author_fullname": "throwawayawayshark", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pfqc2f/aita_for_feeling_weird_about_a_friends/"}, {"title": "AITA for not telling my family why I am unvaccinated?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630488587.0, "author_fullname": "Fedtemp", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pfqc7j/aita_for_not_telling_my_family_why_i_am/"}, {"title": "AITA for being mad at my friend?", "content": "I(24, enby) graduated recently, along with my friend(22, enby).

I was looking for people who shared an interest with me and I was a rather lonely kid. I was never social and I was also just horribly depressed, so when I found a piece of media I really liked, I decided I was going to make some friends and hang out with people I shared an interest with. I found a server that seemed interesting and I joined it.\n\nIt was fine for a while, though about a few months into it, I noticed that most of the mods often ganged up on server members they didn't like for the littlest things. It would often descend to outright bullying. Because of timezones, I often never saw the exchanges happening in realtime, but I could always read the backlog. I thought I was just being too sensitive, though, and that arguments happened with friends all the time, so I never left the server.\n\nIn this server, there was another person who was around my age (let's call them J) , though they were older by a few months. J was a mod, so they were rather close with the other mods, who were mostly adults. One of mods, they actually knew in real life (let's call them K). J and K had been friends since J was around 15-16, and when I joined the server, we were both on track to being 19. I never knew the actual age of K, I just knew that when I joined the server, they were in their thirties.\n\nEventually, I couldn't take the atmosphere in the server anymore where members felt like they had to walk on eggshells so that the mods wouldn't get mad at them for the smallest things, so I left along with a lot of members in the server. I stayed in contact with a few people who were still in the server and who were still friends with the mods. I didn't want to be rude so I just didn't ask them to stop talking with me.\n\nFast forward about a year and a half or so. I'm freshly in my twenties. J is also now freshly in their twenties. My friends who are still in the server tell me a bit of news they're excited about: J and K are dating.\n\nThey were adults, I knew that. But at that moment and until now, I still feel icky about it. I just can't get over the fact that they knew each other when J was a teenager and K would have been in their late twenties or early thirties. K was around for them growing up and then started dating them when they were an adult. I felt really alarmed and weirded out. But all my other friends who were still in the server were all giving their congratulations and saying that they were very happy for the couple, so I've never really known what to think about it? J did say that their family and most of the people they knew irl were very, very against the relationship, but everyone in the server was mostly supportive of it. I didn't know what to think of it and I wasn't in the server so I just didn't say anything.\n\nI still don't know what to think to this day.

So im writing a script and my friend whos 24 and trans asks if they can read through my script, I agreed. Now in the report I used the pronouns he/him to refer to the main people in the incident as they were both male and because that's what the official report used. My friend was not happy about it they were of the opinion that I should use gender neutral pronouns to be more inclusive because I didn't know them and they could be transgender for all I knew. \n\nI said that I would not do that for several reasons, Before I get into that let me just say I dont really care if youre trans or anything, your body your life do what you want.

The report clearly states a pronoun, I dont want to deviate from that. \n2. Using they/them can be confusing and can lead to ambiguity which can place blame on an innocent person. For example, heres a statement that Id write \"Adam and steve were on the deck, adam was the one monitoring the gauges, he then accidentally flipped a switch which caused the vehicle to lose all power\" now rewriting that with they / them you get  \"Adam and steve were on the deck, adam was the one monitoring the gauges, they then accidentally flipped a switch which caused the vehicle to lose all power\" in the second version if youre not paying close attention your takeaway might be that it was a collective decision to flip the switch when it wasnt, it was adams fault. They in this context they is always used to refer to the two people in charge. So people might take that to believe that both people were at fault instead of just one and thats important, because in some of these disasters end in loss of life, so you have to be as clear as possible about what happened\n3. My audience just doesnt care, I can see the analytics and the videos that my audience watches and they watch videos similar to mine and all of them identify as male or female. More importantly they know this stuff, if i were to use they, my audience would be like why are you placing blame on adam and steve when it was completely adams fault, which would result in dislikes on my video and thereby the algorithm yeeting me.  \n\nSo I told my friend that I would stick with the given pronouns and if I do mis-pronoun someone they can contact me and I will gladly add a pinned comment or something that they prefer xyz pronouns.

On my dads side, I have my grandparents (my legal guardians), my dad's 2sisters(L and C) and 1 brother(M), their spouses and kids. \n\nI'm closer to my dad's side of fam bc I lived with them and was raised by them than I am with Aunt K. This really pisses her off but honestly, I do not feel any type of bond with her. Sometimes, I even forget that she exists. Despite this, whenever I can, I call her or plan to meet up with her. \n\nI also sometimes got the feeling that she doesn't like my aunts (especially L and M's wife D). This was clarified when K recently had a fight with them both regarding them naming their kids after my parents (their own brother and SIL). According to K, they don't have any right to use my mom's name and they also shouldn't use my dad's name as a sign of respect for me. I have no problem when my cousins are named after my parents.

She said that I could've made another adjustment for her (which is true) but I chose not to. She called me heartless because I keep excluding her from my life even though I am the only family she has got apart from her husband. At this point I said \"I'm sorry but this is not my fault\".

It\u2019s my second day of orientation now. On the first day, there was lots of activities you could sign up for to make friends. I\u2019m trying to become fluent in Spanish and want to study abroad, so I signed up for a volunteering opportunity where we made water bottles for kids in a rural village in Latin America. \n\nAs it was starting, the group leader who\u2019s a senior realized they forgot some supplies and asked me to get them, so I did and missed introductions, where people give their name and pronouns. I came back and we started making the bottles while speaking in Spanish to practice. The person next to me had large breasts with a feminine face and petite body, and I never would have guessed they were anything other than a girl, so I referred to them in Spanish with the feminine pronoun. Everyone went silent and looked scared. The person looked really angry and said that their pronouns are he/him/his. I didn\u2019t know this since I wasn\u2019t there for pronoun introductions and I\u2019m just barely conversational in Spanish at this point, so I mix up pronouns in Spanish all the time anyway when I\u2019m rushing to keep up with everyone.\n\nIt was extremely tense after that and we worked in silence for the next hour. None of us made eye contact and it was very uncomfortable. Then at lunch the others all sat at a table to eat and moved the extra chairs to a different table. So I sat alone at a different table since there was no place for me to sit. They started speaking Spanish, and most of them studied abroad or traveled to Spain for extended time in high school, so they were way more fluent than me. I only knew Spanish from school, but I could still understand them somewhat and they were speaking loudly. I\u2019m not sure if they realized I understood. They were all making fun of me and the guy I thought was a girl kept pointing at me, which confirmed it.\n\nThe group leader came and asked them why I was sitting alone and they said I had misgendered the guy. So I was dismissed early for creating a hostile environment and they said I\u2019m not welcome back to volunteer for the next two days I signed up for. I went to my dorm and cried since my biggest opportunity to make friends is ruined now. The group leader called hours later and said they don\u2019t have enough volunteers to make the water bottles now, so I can come back the next day actually. I said I didn\u2019t want to come back. I already feel like I don\u2019t belong at this school moving 1400 miles away for college and have no friends here, and spending the first few days with people who hate me would make it worse. I\u2019ll probably spend the next four years avoiding them or trying to. Plus, I don\u2019t think I should speak Spanish anymore until I\u2019m good enough to keep up with everyone more fluent than me.\n\nThe group leader said classes haven\u2019t even started yet and I\u2019ve already let all my classmates down and failed the kids in Latin America who need water bottles. They won\u2019t have water now and it\u2019s my fault.\n\nAITA for not going back?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630393029.0, "author_fullname": "gabbinak", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pf0n3k/aita_for_quitting_my_volunteering_position_on_the/"}, {"title": "Update: AITA for causing trouble between bride &amp; groom?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630393065.0, "author_fullname": "kazownsme", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pf0nds/update_aita_for_causing_trouble_between_bride/"}, {"title": "AITA For not letting him come home after 3 months after all the effort he has made?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630393065.0, "author_fullname": "SabrinaS20", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pf0ndz/aita_for_not_letting_him_come_home_after_3_months/"}, {"title": "AITA for not wanting to invite my cousin to my baby shower ?", "content": "I\u2019m pregnant and I\u2019m due at the end of October ( h*ck yeah baby costumes ) .

My father was always very kind and liked helping people (also helped my mom's side of the family a lot) \n\nHowever, my father reached a point in his life where he had hit rock bottom and did some very terrible things to himself and others. It was a time where he was alone (me, my siblings and my mother moved back to the U.S.) (author's note; my parents never divorced, my father just couldn't go back to the U.S. for legal reasons) and he had fallen into depression and began to use drugs. During this time, none of his siblings (except for a select few) helped him or even decided to check up on him. They knew that he was alone and that he was struggling yet there was no sign of them helping. \n\nFast forward to recent months, my dad has been drug-free for a year now and during this past summer, my mom sent us to stay with him for a while.

The night prior to the so called event, my sister asked me if I was thinking of going (she knows how much I dislike his part of the family) and I was like, \"I don't know, I don't really feel like it.\" And she goes off on me, saying that I should leave everything in the past, that why am I like this, etcetc. \n\nWe went to bed in bad terms because of this. And, recently, I also told my mom about how I didn't enjoy most of my time with my father because of his family and she also went off on me, claiming I should just forgive and forget, that it's affecting me more than it's affecting them, and that it doesn't cost me anything to spend time with them because they care about me. \n\n\nI really don't like spending time with people I don't like as it only drains my energy faster compared to when I'm hanging around people I like.

My childhood was rough, i had to deal with my parents constant fights until my mom issued a divorce after finding out my father cheated on her with his current partner.\n\nMy dad was raised in a religious conservative family. He grew up in third-world poverty during the 70s, that's why he held many ignorant opinions. He disliked hanging out (literally he never took me out to a park), he had bad temper and old-fashion beliefs (i.e. women should be stay-at-home moms, he used to yell at me that \"men don't cry\" whenever i had an emotional outburst, gay marriage is wrong...)\n\nNowadays he has a new family with his partner and overtime he changed many of his ways. He also tries to be in touch with his two daughters and overall he's doing good: he has a good job, a nice home, he found the \"religious stay-at-home mom\" he wanted. His home is basically the Mexican stereotype of a perfect family unit.\n\nOn the other hand, after we moved out, he spread a lot of rumours about my mom, implying that she was crazy and neurotic as a justification for his infidelity. He also kept harassing my mom for many years because he wanted my custody and to stop being forced to pay alimony (my mom couldn't do shit against him because the Mexican law system sucks). His harassment only stopped when he had his sudden \"change of heart\" a few years ago.\n\nWith me, he has been trying to gain my love and my forgiveness. Since my mom had a low-income job, so my dad is the one that pays my school. He has bought me almost everything i have. Also whenever i go visit him on holidays, he spoils me a lot, buys many things for me and gives me a lot of attention, which obviously pisses off his partner.\n\nLast year, my mom lost her job. I failed my admission test for university, so i'll be free for one year. My dad gave me a very nice job offer with him and even the opportunity to attend to a private university in the city where he lives. I declined his offer saying that i wouldn't like to live with him, which pissed him off. He ended up playing the victim saying that i was resentful and that my mom poisoned me, which obviously pissed me off.\n\nBeing honest, i live happy with my mom, even if we don't have a lot of money. She accepts me just as i am and i have a lot of freedom with her, something that i wouldn't have with my dad. I'm bi and i know his standpoint about LGBTQ+ rights; i also know that he wouldn't let me paint my nails or having a piercing. I also have a dog and, since he and his partner dislike dogs, i'd have to leave her with my mom. I'm also a bit resentful towards him, after all he did to my mom and the fact that he gave his daughters a better childhood than the one he gave me. He also belittles my career choice, saying that i'm wasting my potential.\n\nI'm willing to forgive him, but i don't wanna live with him.\n\nAITA for not wanting to mend my relationship with my dad?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630398883.0, "author_fullname": "Bardowne", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pf1rlp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_mend_my_relationship_with/"}, {"title": "AITA for calling out a new member of our gym for being rude?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630398927.0, "author_fullname": "Arisa-Ari-chan", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pf1rwd/aita_for_calling_out_a_new_member_of_our_gym_for/"}, {"title": "AITA for calling out a new member of our gym for being rude?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630399096.0, "author_fullname": "Arisa-Ari-chan", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pf1sxw/aita_for_calling_out_a_new_member_of_our_gym_for/"}, {"title": "AITA for blocking my former tour guide after he asked for money?", "content": "Throwaway account.

A few months after I left, he messaged me and said the political situation in his country was bad, and could I send him money. I said sorry, couldn't do that, but told him he seemed like a decent person and perhaps he could find a \"sugar daddy\" for support. Never heard from him after that. \n\nNow, almost two years later, I get another text from him asking for help, as apparently the political situation in his country has gotten worse. He also apparently called me, but I missed it. I blocked him after that.

I have the impression that she thinks she\u2019s inferior to other Japanese members because she can speak a bit of English. The girl has little interest in other Japanese members and her sole focus is on the Americans. Whatever, I\u2019ve seen it happen before and it\u2019s only new to me. \n\nAs soon as she found out my mom and I speak English her whole attitude to us changes. The girl barely regarded us, but now goes out of her way to ignores us. Greetings are mandatory in Japan and she will greet everyone accept for us. My mom tried speaking to her about information about joining, but she deliberately ignored her. I got mad and told her that my mother is asking her a question a bit firmly. The girl made it seem like she didn\u2019t hear her, which was a lie. Whenever my mom translates the girl gives her the dirtiest look. So I asked her if she had a problem and she tried to play it off like I was trying to attack her. Like she\u2019s in her 30\u2019s and she\u2019s trying to keep up this innocent bubbly persona, tried to make me look like I was bullying her. My mom got mad at me for defending her, saying if I was mature enough then I wouldn\u2019t have said anything. I\u2019m appalled, I\u2019m not going to sit around and let some stranger disrespect my family like that.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be rude to me, since I don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019m there to keep up with what I learned with all my life and exercise. But giving attitude to my mom, all she does is help that gym whenever she has the time to come\u2026 unacceptable.

I just find it so odd that lately she'd persisted with the messages to a degree that i had to block her number. Not sure why she wants to get back in touch with me right now when she really has her life put together, now being married with someone else and having \"some of her kids \" along with her.\n\nI made up my mind and i want her gone from my life forever. Even through my father never found someone else i do have other people around me to help with my situation, but it's been nine years for fuck sake.

My parents were already divorced but still lived together btw. Not long after she left and I turned 18 I moved out and started living with my bf, but I saw my mom and her bf from time to time and there was always conflict between us all. \n\nThe last time I saw them I got into a big fight with them that ended with me and her bf saying very unkind words to each other. I don\u2019t dislike him or anything, but I don\u2019t fully like him either. Anyways, my graduation was this last June and when I was sending out invitations I decided not to invite my mom\u2019s bf for a number of reasons. \n\nOne being that my dad is very upset about my mom leaving still and especially about how she left so I was worried that if he saw them with each other a fight might break out. Two being that I just don\u2019t know her bf that well yet and wanted only close family to come to my graduation because it was such a special moment for me. I struggled a lot in school and I technically was never supposed to graduate but got it together in time. I just wanted it to be a day that was about my special achievement and I didn\u2019t want any conflict or awkwardness to unfold. \n\nMy mom got very upset when I told her that only she can come and not him. She told me that they are a package deal and if he can\u2019t come she won\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t back down and so she didn\u2019t go. \n\nI feel like may be I was the asshole because I put my mom in a really bad position and made her chose between me and her bf (which isn\u2019t what I meant to do).

We had two boys not long after, who I will call Jack and Julian.\n\nWhen my wife got pregnant again, she said that she wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. Work was going great for me and my parents promised to help out every now and then. So, initially I was happy to agree. I often had to stay later at work with my wife now at home but I believed her when she said it was not a big deal.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when the baby was clearly not mine. I am white, my wife is East Asian, baby has distinctly Black features. I filed for divorce right away, thank god for prenups.\n\n We had split custody of the boys but ex was often busy. Her parents didn\u2019t like our relationship and cut her off (maybe the right call), and my parents werent around to help. I realize she is struggling but I simply can\u2019t feel empathy for her after what she did.\n\nJack is now 10 and Julian 7. They are bright and polite young boys. I'm proud of them despite what I went through with their mom. \n\nBut my mom (their grandma) recently let slip that my ex is occupied with her other child, which is why she hardly comes to visit. (She started hating my ex since the divorce, but I didn't expect her to be that careless)\n\nNaturally the boys had tons questions about their \"other brother\u201d, why he doesn't visit, why I don't want to see him (of course they think I'm the other kid's dad too). When school started, Julian was excited to tell all his friends how he is going to see his long lost brother. \n\nWhen I told them no, they couldn't go see him, Jack accused me of abandoning their mom and brother. He is usually such an empathetic kid that I didn't expect him to be so snappy with me.  \n\nHonestly, after a peaceful few years, I couldn't take having all this brought back again and got frustrated. I pulled up my ex wife's pictures with the kid in them and asked the boys if they still think that is their brother and want to see him. \n\nI guess it upset them to see their mom having let herself go, and a kid who doesn't look like mine. Julian was confused, but Jack caught on and started to cry, which made his little brother follow suit. Now they are both acting cold with me (Julian probably because he is just copying his older brother), and do not ask about their mom anymore. \n\nAt least Jack is no longer saying I abandoned his other family, so I think I did the right thing. My sister believes I was being cruel, but she always sided with my ex. She and her husband don\u2019t have kids so I\u2019m not too sold on her advice anyway. My mom and I agree that my ex should have been the one to talk about it with Jack and Julian as the other kid is hers. All I did was tell them the truth\u2014I just didn't want to take the disrespect and baseless accusations anymore.  \n\nSo Reddit, I guess your verdict may be worth less than pennies in my real life, but I'd like outsider opinions.

However, later that day, she came up to me all pissed because our roommate put her giant bowl in the sink. I was like \u201cSo? Wasn\u2019t it empty?\u201d And she said that it wasn\u2019t. She was planning on scraping off the sides which she thought had enough for one more serving.

She said that our roommate should\u2019ve at least asked her first.

She told me that she wanted to share it with our roommates before it went stale. She also went to the store to get lunch meat for the sandwiches. I paid for half of it since we were going to share.\n\nMy roommate later asked me if she could make a sandwich since she knew my cousin was okay with her eating the bread. I said yes. She also asked if she could use the lunch meat, and that she would make me a sandwich too. I said that that was fine, since half of the lunch meat was supposed to be mine anyway.\u00a0\n\nThe next day, my cousin went to make a sandwich, and she came back freaking out that her lunch meat was gone. Just to clarify, she bought two small packages of meat. The meat that was gone was one that she had already opened before our roommate and I got into it. I told her that I shared it with our roommate the other day, and that\u2019s why it was gone.\u00a0\n\nShe freaked out and told me that I shouldn\u2019t have shared the meat without asking her. I told her I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal since half of the meat was mine, and there was still a full unopened package left for her to use, so it\u2019s not like we left her with nothing.

I was like, \u201cAll you have to do is ask her to ask you before throwing something out.\u201d But she\u2019s not a confrontational person, so she doesn\u2019t want to do it.

It finally reached a breaking point when she kept pressing my friend to talk to her about her new hormone medication, though the night prior they got into an argument about medication for seizures and that my cousin wasn\u2019t willing to get them (and only did once I saw a therapist, to make stuff more about her but I digress) which made my friend quiet reasonably upset. So the next day when she started a conversation about \u201cmedication\u201d my friend thought it was about the seizure medication and not hormones. My friend told her \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that\u201d because she didn\u2019t want to ruin the mood or get upset again. Even after hearing that my cousin kept pushing and trying to talk about it, never explicitly telling my friend it was hormones just kept saying \u201cmedication.\u201d Eventually my friend got mad and left so I got mad at her and basically told her that she needs to stop making our issues hers and vice versa. Then she talked about how she just wanted to tell my friend about her new hormone medication only now telling us it\u2019s hormones after my friend got upset and left. She then got upset because her hormones were all out of wack, and while I understand that\u2019s a real issue she\u2019s an adult and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an excuse.

I'm an RA on campus, and I've been here for about a month. During training (the first three weeks of August), we were working 8am-2am doing normal training during the day and other residual duties during the night like door decs, bulletin boards, room check reports, loft kits, bunk kits, welcome decor, etc. I was exhausted and ready to quit by the end of it, but I saw the start of school as the light at the end of the tunnel. It was not.\n\nI'm a first year RA in a freshman dorm, I was given the hall with almost all athletes (including the entire freshman class of rugby players), and given 48 residents when I was told to expect about 25 when I was hired. Enrollment is down across campus, so they closed half of the dorm halls and filled the other half to maximum capacity and hired less RAs to save money. Since the start of school, I've had to write up about 15 residents for things like quiet hour violations, parties, alcohol, and weed. As a result, the residents hate me and have started to write nasty comments about me on a whiteboard near my room.\n\nMine and other RAs concerns have not been met with any action from the reslife staff. Before school started we told the staff that we were concerned that alcohol and drug incidents would be worse this year due to lifting covid restrictions, our concerns fell on deaf ears and the RAs are paying for it. I have worked upwards of 60 hours this week on a stipend that only pays me about $200 a pay period.\n\nI texted my friend tonight to express my frustration and let her know that I was quitting. I was met with her accusing me of being cowardly and running away from the challenge instead of stepping up to the plate. She told me that real life and jobs aren't easy, and that things won't get handed to me like I'm used to. I believe she was referencing my scholarship being handed to me, I have an academic full ride (tuition, room &amp; board, meal plan) at the school I attend, and I've worked towards it my whole life. It was not handed to me. She said I should just be happy to have a job, and shouldn't walk away when it gets hard. She's mad at me now, saying I'm acting privileged by quitting my job and she thinks I should stay so I don't let my fellow RAs down. She says the workload I'll be putting on them is unfair and that I should just suck it up for my coworkers sake.\n\nAm I the asshole for quitting?", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1630306512.0, "author_fullname": "fck_mylife", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pecu51/aita_for_being_privileged_enough_to_quit_my_job/"}, {"title": "AITA for thinking/feeling this way?

Our dorms are like tiny apartments where we all have our own locked rooms but share the kitchen and bathrooms. We\u2019re allowed to have pets in the dorm because the field of study is around animals. I have 2 cats that only stay in my room. My room is a bit small but I\u2019ve created space for my cats to climb up and stuff to do so they don\u2019t get bored and destroy the dorm room. \n\nThe problem: Both of my cats are rescues from bad homes so their care is a bit different. Both of them refuse to use any scented litter, I\u2019ve tried to get them used to it by mixing a little of it to their normal litter but then they go and pee somewhere else, usually my bed so that\u2019s a no. I tried changing the litter boxes to ones with lids and filters but soon found out my other cat is afraid of the flap so I took the flap off. Then I found out it\u2019s not only the flap but the whole lid. Now I have one open litter box and one filtered on. I\u2019m trying the lid again slowly once she might realise the other cat used the filtered one well but it\u2019s a slow process with traumatised cats. I have my windows open often but it can get too cold. I clean the litter daily and I wash the bottom of the boxes with water weekly. \n\nNow I know cat pee is not a fun smell, especially if you\u2019re not used to it. None of my dorm mates have cats so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an issue to them. They haven\u2019t complained yet but my brother visited the dorm and right away noticed the smell which is why I\u2019m so worried about it. My dorm mates are mostly 16-17 year olds so I think they might be afraid or too anxious to mention it. The dorms are small, our dorm has 4 people in it and has 4 rooms (one for each) so the smaller space might make it worse\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, you get so used to cats\u2019 pee smell when you own them because of all the cleaning and so on that you don\u2019t notice it so I don\u2019t know how noticable it actually is \n\nI\u2019m also very socially anxious so I feel anxious when it comes to asking my dorm mates about the smell. Especially as it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable question in my opinion\n\nI had my cats way before I moved to a dorm and it was a battle to get them to open up to me or humans over all so getting rid of them is not an option. I\u2019m also extremly attached to them and they\u2019ve helped my mental health a lot.\n\nTLDR: I try everything possible to keep cat pee smell away from my dorm but have limited options.

The issue is location. He lives with his parents still, and he works a 9-5 like schedule M-F, exactly as my roommates. We usually hang out on the weekends, but with his parents being home and my roommate being home at the same time we don\u2019t have a place to ourselves, not the preferred choice when wanting to be intimate. Some of you might be wondering why I\u2019m so impartial to having sex with my roommate home, I know people do it all the time. My \u201croommate\u201d happens to be my aunt who I live with (F53). I\u2019m bothered by the idea of us having sex, and her KNOWING that we are there to have sex, while she is home in the next room over. It\u2019s a small apartment. \n\nI\u2019ve had sex while she is home, but she has had zero knowledge of that, whether it be me and someone being intimate while she is asleep or being very quiet with an established partner who I have been with for awhile. \n\nShe sometimes goes out on the weekends with friends and has even spent the night at their places when she drinks a little too much, so I suggested that we should plan a time sometime soon where she were to go out with friends while me and this guy have a night to ourselves while she\u2019s out. She got a little frustrated and said that it was selfish of me to ask her to leave her own home so that I could have a night alone. She pays most of the rent and even though she does go out with friends often she wasn\u2019t willing (not that I made any demands, or even asked, just made a suggestion) to go out for a night just so that him and I could have sex even though she would be there, probably hearing us, knowing what we are doing. She claims that I\u2019m too stuck in the concept of us being family, and that normal roommates would never ask this of their roommate. \n\nMy issue is this: I don\u2019t want him to be uncomfortable knowing a family member can hear us. I don\u2019t want to have to start our sexual relationship off by being limited like that, I want to know what we are like together with no limitations if that makes sense. I also don\u2019t want him to meet her, I see coming into contact with family as a big step in dating, and if I could have it my way my aunt wouldn\u2019t meet my partners until we were official, something else that she sees differently. My aunt says she has the right to be there whenever she pleases because it is her place, and even though we are family I have to think of her more as a roommate in this situation and just deal with it. I agree, but I didn\u2019t make any demands and I didn\u2019t think I was asking too much, but she seemed frustrated that I even bothered to ask.

But I just thought I'd check. First we need a bit of context...\n\nI'm 20M. My friend (We'll call her Jane) is 22F. She's very sexually active and gets alot of male attention at clubs. She pretty much always gets a guys number and has someone to take home most nights out. This part of her lifestyle is totally cool with me and I actually quite enjoy going out with her because she doesn't cock-block me and I don't cock-block her. \n\nScenario time. So Jane's ex-flatmate visited for the weekend. He's cool, I get along well with him. First pub we went to, Jane pulled her usual stunt and found an attractive guy to snog and dance with. Me and ex-flatmate (We'll call him John) danced together on the periphery making sure she didn't get harassed by any sleeze-bags. No issues in pub one, we finished up and moved on to a second pub. \n\nNow is where I may be the AH. I was really tired, I don't know why, I'd drunk much less than usual and I'd slept well the night before. But for some reason I was just a bit tired. I wanted to stay out because I hadn't been out with Jane and John for months and I didn't want to miss this opportunity. So I said to them that I needed to grab a bite to eat or have a coffee so that I could keep partying. But they totally ignored me. All Jane could do was talk about this cute guy she'd pulled and John kept talking about it too. It wasn't even like it was a discussion, she kept saying \"he's so hot\" repeatedly. At first I just walked along and entertained the conversation, but after we'd walked past McDonalds and 2 convenience stores, I just got agitated. I just felt really rejected and insignificant. I said \"Jesus Jane we get it, a hot guy is gonna *explicit*. What's new? I need something to eat otherwise I'm gonna fall asleep in the next pub\". She then said \"Don't be such a self-centred asshole, I'm having a good time and you're ruining it by making it about you and your energy.\" to which I responded, \"How am I the selfish one? You're talking about this guy who will mean nothing to you tomorrow morning and completely disregarding me as one of your closest friends\". There was a small amount of back and forth, John took her side. In the end we just walked into the next pub. I walked straight to the bar to order a redbull and a glass of water. Nothing was really said after that.\n\nSo AITA? Imo I just wanted a bit of sustinence so I could stay with them and carry on our great night, but maybe I'm being self-centred and unreasonable.\n\nTLDR; My friend \"Jane\" gets laid most nights out, she got some guy's attention and kept talking about it with her friend John. Meanwhile I was trying to tell them both that I was tired and needed something to eat so that we could keep partying. Jane and John ignored me and when I snapped, they told me to stop being so self-centred.

He was the first person I wanted to talk to about it and just cry. When I told him what happened, he told me to go see a professional and that when he feels bad he plays video games or focuses on hobbies and that\u2019s what I should do. I tell him not to talk to me about therapy because I already go and that I just need him to listen to me. He proceeds to tell me to do fun projects and to focus on myself to not feel so sad. Then asks what I want to order for dinner.\n\nI\u2019m numb to this for a week because I\u2019m grieving and have bigger things on my mind. I give him the benefit of the doubt that this is really uncomfortable territory that he doesn\u2019t know how to handle. However, he has not been this insensitive before and has been capable of just being there for me. During the whole week he doesn\u2019t bring it up at all. He\u2019s unemployed and doesn\u2019t drive and I WFH. He doesn\u2019t check in on me. He leaves for the weekend to hang out with a friend. When he comes back, in a conversation I tell him I feel very isolated and that I hope he isn\u2019t avoiding me because I don\u2019t like feeling like I\u2019m fragile or that I\u2019m a disease especially in a time like this. He says don\u2019t make a big deal out of it and leaves.\n\nI blow up the next day telling him to sleep on the couch because of his lack of awareness for how hard this is. Out of anger I call him a child for being so emotionally stunted. I cry everyday as we share the same room and he doesn\u2019t say a damn thing. I tell him how this makes me feel and he explains himself by saying that he thought I needed space. We continue arguing resulting in him wanting me to move out because I\u2019m hurting him with my \u201cunhealthy\u201d lashing out.\n\nI move out. Because I don\u2019t want to live with someone who 1) doesn\u2019t want me there and 2) was a friend who I feel does not have my back.

As soon as I mentioned how much I loved the film, my non-binary and gay classmate (NBG) and their friend (who happens to be lesbian) (L) butted in.\n\nJust to clear up confusion, NBG is both non binary as well as gay, not two different people. L is a separate person though.\n\nAnyway, NBG butted in, exclaiming about how I was a \"homophobic pig\". When I asked why, L stated that because Romeo and Juliet is a \"straight love story\" and that I enjoyed it, I am homophobic!\n\nOf cause, being called homophobic is not something to be taken lightly, so I said \"please just leave me alone\", which resulted in a solid five minutes of being called homophobic.\n\nAfter deciding that I couldn't take it anymore, I turned around and said \"Please may you stop being so Hetrophobic\", which shut them up.\n\nI understand that appropriating the word \"homophobic\" is insensitive, and I will gladly take blame for, but I still cannot think of a better way to get NBG and L to stop harassing me. There is no point in going to the teachers are either wrapped around NBG's pinky finger or too scared of being called homophobic and having bad PR and would have done nothing about it.\n\nI only really remembered to repost because NBG (whose in the same class, so is unavoidable) mentioned the incident and kept on saying how homophobic it was for me to say that they were \"hetrophobic\", and I just want an outsider's opinion.\n\nSo, AITA for potentially being homophobic by defending myself from a bull?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1630311285.0, "author_fullname": "Buddaysh", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pedrx2/aita_for_intentionally_annoying_an_lgbt_classmate/"}, {"title": "AITA: upset about bf going on holiday?", "content": "I (f23) was in a car accident about 2 months ago, still suffering with whiplash symptoms, anxiety and flashbacks, and I lost my Grandad a month ago so I'm not doing very good mentally atm so I'm not sure if I'm just upset, as in it's my grief talking, or if I'm in the right to be upset, if that makes sense?\n\nSo my bf (m25) and I went out clubbing with his friends and my sister a few nights ago. One friend suggests going to Denmark to visit one of their friends from school, who moved out there 2 years ago, at Halloween for about a week. My sister said she's in, I said that I couldn't because buying a new car set me back a few thousand and I wanted to keep saving for a house (my bf and I are moving in together around Easter time next year). My bf says he's in and so does another girl and one of the boys there. The rest of the night, they were all talking about going to see the friend, looking at hotel prices, etc.\n\nI didn't say anything at the club but the next day bf and I went to the gym. On the way back when he was dropping me off back home, I asked him if he was actually considering going to denmark and he said yes because he has Halloween week off anyway and won't be doing anything else. He said I should go as well but I said I can't really afford it, plus I wouldn't want our first holiday abroad to be with his friends and my sister, I may sound old fashioned but I feel like the first holiday abroad is meant to be kind of special? He said to just not think of it as our first holiday abroad and I didn't say anything then because I wasn't sure what to say.\n\nThere's also a few other reasons I'm upset but I didn't want to say them because I wasn't sure if I was being TA or not. A few weeks ago, my friend said about all of us going to Alton towers for the weekend for Halloween, with 2 for 1 tickets, I said it may be a bit expensive and bf agreed even though in total, it works out cheaper than Denmark. I feel that we should be saving our money as much as possible because houses aren't cheap and I could be out of work for a year a few months after moving in because I may be going back to uni full time if I get accepted, which he knows about and says he fully supports. I'm also not fully comfortable with him going on holiday with a few girls (and my sister), and to go visit a friend who's a girl. She is lovely but I'm just not 100% comfortable with him spending that much to see her.

I\u2019ve taken to saving money for purchases but my brother tries to make all my purchases \u201cfamily purchases\u201d.\n\nIn April of 2021 I purchased a PS4 on my birthday, and he immediately demanded and account on it and games he wanted after my father set me up an account to get me started.\n\nMy brother continues to do things like this and can\u2019t take a simple no.\nYesterday my mother wanted to go a shop to buy photo frames while me and my brother were playing games. He\u2019s taken to playing a specific game on his phone nonstop and when my mother asked to go we had been playing games for an hour and a half already.\nI called that I would like to finish my game but my mother refused so I turned it off. My brother, however began a screaming match (which is common and is one sided, with him just yelling at my mum) and he had a temper tantrum. By the time we left I was seething with him as this happens on the regular and I was rather fed up.\n\nWhen we got home I decided to do some reading and he kept pestering me to play his phone game with him (which I also play but in moderation- I have half the play hours he does). When I kept telling him no he began to cry to my mum that I was being unfair to him (Which is also a regular occurrence). My mum blew him off and said she was tired of him doing this all the time. \n\nMy father is the only person that seems to acknowledge and actively punish bad behavior (he\u2019ll remove gaming time if we misbehave repeatedly).

He\u2019ll pull this card even if we just need to go to Tesco (a UK supermarket chain).\nThe final straw was yesterday when I had stated that I wanted to play one of my single player games during my hour of gaming. He flew off the rails after I told him I wouldn\u2019t play his phone game with him and later he walked into my room, sat on my chair (where I had just got up to get a pen) and began playing his phone game. \n\nThis was after he ran out all the hot water and hid in his room for an hour, which delayed a movie night I was very excited to have to the point where it was cancelled.\n\nI told him to get out and go to bed- it was 9:00- and he began crying and yelling, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d And \u201chow do I deserve this?\u201d My mum told me to stop starting on him, and I just went to bed.
