Frankly, I think it\u2019s hilarious she thinks she can tell me what to do or control my actions in any way, so my best friend and I decided to prank her.\n\nThe girl was sitting in the library at lunch where she always sits, probably since no one ever wants to sit with her in the lunch room. My friend had a test to make up from when she was absent and the teacher gave it to her to go take in the library. My friend and I sat at the table next to the girl, and I pretended to write down all her answers while she took the test. I kept asking her for the answers and writing things like I was cheating.\n\nLike we thought, the girl fell for it and decided to butt into our business. She reported us to the teacher. I had already taken the test, and my teacher could clearly see my friend and I put different answers for things. So she knew we didn\u2019t cheat and asked why the girl was saying this. I said that the girl has threatened me before that she will report me for cheating (which is completely true) and that I think she just likes to bully us and threaten us. My teacher said she\u2019s going to take action in accordance with the bullying handbook.\n\nSince there was proof we didn\u2019t cheat, the girl will probably be suspended for threatening and bullying, since that\u2019s the zero-tolerance policy in the bullying handbook.

I really love it and it makes me look really cute. When I got home, my mom said \u201cwhat the fuck have you done with your hair? You don\u2019t look good at all\u201d. I ignored her. I went to my room. I showed my hair to my siblings(18f and 12m) and they loved it. My mom again came to our room and said, \"You look like a monkey. This hair doesn\u2019t suit you at all. You look like a crazy woman.\u201d She was nagging and nagging. Even my sister got annoyed and said, \"it's just her hair, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d She didn\u2019t stop.

I am not really dying to talk to her. And this morning my father came to my room and said, \"What is wrong with your hair? You have got too much freedom. You are out of control\u201d.\n\nThe haircut I got is just bangs and layers. That\u2019s it. \n\nI said what I said because whatever I do is always an issue to my mom. The last time I got my hair dyed, she yelled at me saying, \u201cyou have got too much freedom. Who told you to get your hair dyed and who gave you money?\u201d I kept silent at the time. I never ask my parents for money. I buy dresses for myself. They pay for my studies. That\u2019s it. And trust me when I say this, I have studied through scholarships for most of my life. They are paying almost 4000$ for my undergrad. I even buy my siblings lunch almost everyday when my parents go to work without giving them pocket money. I always buy dresses for my sister. I help mom with dishes. In fact, I do all the dishes, every time.

Another thing that really annoys me is she is always calling between 2-4am even when I told her I have work and I get up at 5am and not to call me so late (she has never respected this boundary). On this night I snapped and I told her I was very worried for her and that she desperately needed to get help bc I didn\u2019t want to bury my sister.

He has been through terrible tragedy before, losing his previous serious girlfriend about 5 years ago. He unfortunately recently went through another horrible tragedy, losing his home to a forest fire. Him and his girlfriend are safe. They were able to evacuate, get out almost all of their belongings and help neighbors evacuate too. I cannot imagine how bad it would feel to experience the amount of loss that he has. Luckily, he has a place to live temporarily through friends and a great support system.\n\nMy FIL set up a gofundme, with my BIL approving it and advertising it. The goal was to help raise money for what was lost, what may not be covered under insurance and to help them get by in the meantime. I happily donated a generous amount, and I spread the word to my friends and family. I wanted to help, and I figured even every little bit would be helpful. Many of my family members donated generous amounts as well. The gofundme was successful in fundraising a solid amount of money, and I was grateful.\n\nA week or two later, he proposed to his girlfriend. They had been together long enough and are a good match. Everyone is happy that there is some positive news for them after such an awful situation. I am happy for them too.\n\nHowever, he proposed with a decently-sized diamond ring. I learned that he bought the ring after all the fundraising. He did not have the ring before the fire. The fire was the catalyst for the proposal. I told my wife that it felt wrong that he bought an expensive ring after asking for and accepting donations. I feel that the money was given to help him rebuild and get by in other ways. Of course it is his money to do what he wants with it, and this is rising from the ashes in just a different way than what I was intending to contribute.\n\nMy wife argues that he was planning on proposing before, and that he had the money for the ring already. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say this is true. However, if he had enough money for an expensive ring, then he didn\u2019t truly need a gofundme. In my opinion, he should have gotten her a more affordable ring considering the circumstances. \n\nMy wife sees nothing wrong with the situation, and she said she couldn\u2019t believe that I thought her brother was such a horrible person and would do such a thing. I don\u2019t, and I feel sorry for what he has been through. I\u2019m happy that he has some good news. The timeline of events with the fundraising just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I feel taken advantage of, in a way. I also feel bad for encouraging my friends and family to help.

So any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIt was my (48F) Birthday a few days ago and i was celebrating with my husband (50M) and my two kids, the day started out great but that changed around 11AM that morning when my husband confronted me about dinner - some context, usually when someone in our family has a birthday both my parents and my husbands parents will come around that night for dinner, I had invited my parents but not my husbands parents for a few reasons, 1: we had just gotten out of a level 4 lock down where we are living and his parents would have to travel to come to the dinner which are PM is advising we don't do at the moment, 2: me and his parents have never really gotten along that well, we are civil with each other but they don't like me very much. 3: i just want a quiet evening with my parents my husband and children.\n\nSo my husband confronted me about not inviting his parents and i told him those reasons but he was still mad at me and just walked off without saying anything, my parents come around and while they're here hes acting fine with me but the moment they leave he's back to silence again. A day passes and he's still giving me the silent treatment so i ask him why he's still mad at me, and he say's hes not mad at me, obviously this upsets me and we start yelling, i'm yelling about how he's giving me the worst birthday ever and how i don't deserve his silent treatment, and he's yelling about how he's doing no such thing. He walks away mid argument and go to walk into my room just to turn around too see my kids standing there, the youngest (12M) crying for me, since me and his father don't fight like this.\n\nWe just ate dinner and i was met more silence from my husband and my kids trying to stop dinner from being so quiet and awkward.

Though I will admit I can't say I'll keep doing it once I'm back to work. Found a good job that'll start next month.\n\nI've almost kicked him out at the encouragement of my friends 3 times, but I love him and if I kicked him out he'd be homeless and destitute so I always cave and let him stay. He's been promising for months to get a job, at the very least to keep up with his responsibility as the homemaker. Neither has happened. I found him a job in a warehouse where he could make more than double what fast food would offer (not having a GED limits him severely so fast food and some warehouse work is all he's qualified for) but he failed the drug screen. They said he can retest and when he's clean he can start work but he hasn't stopped smoking yet. There's always another reason or someone giving him bud for free. He goes \"you can't get mad because it's free\"...\n\nHis connection to bud is a beast all its own so idk if it would be considered relevant or not? \nBut I get annoyed with the situation a lot lately, especially since we found out 2 weeks ago that I'm pregnant again.

My dad (58) took me to the ER because I couldn\u2019t drive myself with how much pain I was in. He stayed long enough to know they were going to do a surgery, but he decided to go home and sleep before he went to work in a few hours. I texted my younger sister (24) about the surgery and how nervous I was. She and my other sister live in different states, so the first thing she asked is if Dad was there. I told her no, he had to work soon and she immediately spammed my dad saying he should be there and he ended up coming back and calling out of work so he could be there. My younger sister also messaged my older sister (28), who has been a little more distant from us because she\u2019s dedicated to her family, husband and two kids, and has never made an effort to come see me in the last 7 years because \u2018it\u2019s just too hard too travel with kids\u2019, and I get that. So I\u2019ve visited her a few times in the past years. Well she texts me too saying that she hopes my surgery goes well and she\u2019ll call me afterward.\n\nTurns out, it was a softball sized benign tumor that had completely \u2018killed\u2019 my ovary, so they had to remove both. After the surgery, when I wasn\u2019t drowsy, I tried to call my sisters but they were both too busy. I didn\u2019t want to send them what happened in a text, so I just waited for them to call me back, but they never did. \n\nFlash forward 3 weeks and it\u2019s my younger sisters birthday so I call her to wish her a happy birthday, because she really was supportive to me and we do talk a lot more than my other sister. A week and a half later, it\u2019s my older sister\u2019s birthday and I guess I was feeling petty and didn\u2019t bother to wish her a happy birthday. Even though I never complained to anyone how hurt I felt that they didn\u2019t call me after my surgery, my sister blows up talking about how rude I am for not calling her. But she doesn\u2019t say that to me, she says it to my dad and sister, and then both of them relay it to me. \n\nThen comes the horrible luck of my dad butt dialing her while he\u2019s telling me this. I said that I really don\u2019t care because she doesn\u2019t seem to care about my life or how I\u2019m doing. Well, she lets us know that she heard everything and was mad. She\u2019s been even more distant than before, doesn\u2019t respond to any of messages in our (my sisters) group message unless it\u2019s directly about her. And then she just sends pictures of bread she makes, expecting us to praise her on it, and they\u2019re usually right after she ignored a message from me.

She researched all the treatments, a couple of different hospitals, borrowed the money from me, which she paid back befor the deadline, got the procedure. She came back home with a high fever, and was sick for several days afterwards. I took care of her, but this was during the beginning of the craziness, so everyone was worried. We quarantined, cost us a little bit in lost earnings, but it was ok. \n\nFast forward to now, and well, I have and have had, the *opposite* problem for pretty much my entire life from about age 10. The problem is visible even when I have slimmed down, and even at my lightest, well... moobs. People have mocked me ***relentlessly*** my entire life for this. I recently found out that not only was it possible, but perfectly **safe** to have reduction surgery. I did my research with the help of a friend's SO who is VP of a cosmetic clinic (I did not choose hers in the end) and also my HMO. I settled on a place and I'm going to have non-invasive surgery.\n\nI have kept my wife informed **at every stage** of this process , from beginning to end. And she has not shown the least understanding or empathy for me. She believes it's not necessary as it's not a life threatening problem and she doesn't care about my body. Ok, I appreciate the sentiment, and I'm glad. But this ***bothers me:*** and the problem can be fixed.\n\nShe first began hassling me about hospitals - which one? Why? How many have you researched? How do you know that doctor is good? Have you watched the operation on the internet? What do people say?\n\nI answered her questions patiently, but it became pretty obvious that no matter what I said or did **a)** She does not want me to have the surgery and **b)** the reason for that is because I plan to have it during an upcoming national holiday, which would \"ruin our plans\" (we were planning to go to an expensive brunch on one day) but give me more time to recover. I even mentioned that although there would be pain, the whole thing would take 3 hours and in most cases people go back to work the next day, and in some cases, afternoon if they have it done in the morning. I have checked with multiple sources on this.\n\nAfter a consultation at the hospital, I decided to go with the non-invasive option, as it's slightly more expensive, yields the same results, and won't require surgery. She seemed pleased that was the case, but blew up when I told her it was $1000 more expensive than the surgery option. I went through the reasoning again. She finally accepted and said \"Well, at least we can go to brunch\".\n\nThat got me. \"So, the only real objection you had to me doing it in the vacation was because it would throw off our 'plans'?\" She blustered, rehashed the old ground we had gone over, I mentioned she was fine with it so long as we could have an expensive brunch? She kept going over the same arguments we had time and again, repeating previous points that I had explained to her. She raised her voice, shouted, got aggressive (I stayed calm) at the end of it I said \"I would hope you would support me in something non-invasive, simple and safe. But regardless, it's **my body, my choice.** And I want to feel good about myself.\"\n\nWell, apparently, that's only something for women to say, as men have oppressed them and controlled their bodies.

A couple of days ago I drove my little sister to get a physical exam, and she also agreed to get a flu shot.

Anyhow, everything was going fine, until the nurse came in to take her to the backroom. I went with them, and already, I could tell that the nurse was not in the mood. She had this very come-here-now and do-this-because-i-say-so-attitude. Whatever, I brushed it off as her just having a bad day/being exhausted, and didn't take it personally. She left and I stood outside while the doctor did the physical for my sister, and everything went well. I came back in before the nurse went to get the vaccine. I could tell my sister was shaky and nervous but she was doing her best to be calm, as was I. The same nurse came in with the vaccine. She got it all ready, when my sister asked her to give her a minute or two to calm herself down and asked her if she could lie down. This woman flat out said NO because she said that she had things to do and didn't want to waste her time. My sister then replied that she was afraid of needles and that she was a fainter. The nurse then said that my sis needed to grow up and stop acting like a baby. I was getting upset and responded that what she said was very insensitive to anyone with anxiety and phobias and she needed to stop being rude, and she needed to accommodate my sister, who was starting to tear up at this point. This bitch then started to raise her voice and told her to stop crying and get it over with,, or else she would have to hold her down and inject her. Now, this is something that I feel very strongly against. This has happened to me in the past, where our abusive father would come with me to my appointments, and whenever I needed a shot, instead of the nurses reasoning with me, the bitches and my dad would restrain me, causing a lot of trauma. I wouldn't be surprised if my sister went through this too. I then told the nurse that her doing that will NOT be happening and that she should be ashamed for even considering doing something so scarring and, yes, abusive. She then said that \"sometimes kids need to be scarred to toughen them up\" and that she knew that because she was a mother. I lost my shot at this point and told her that I felt so awful for her kids for having such a terrible mom. I grabbed my sis and walked out of the room, while I heard the dumbfuck yelling at me in the background. My poor sis was having a panic attack.

She said that i should go as GM is growing old and it could be one the last times i get to see her. And i should attend to make GM happy.\nI replied that i was very tired because the lack of sleep due to pain and rather spend the days resting and recovering and keep my health in check.\nShe kept pushing by repeating that GM is growing old and we don't know how much longer she'll be around and that i barely visit her. (GM is healthy tho albeit with some physical problems which she has a wheelchair for)\nAt that point i grew tired of her using this against me(almost every time when it's about GM). So i rudely applied that she should stop trying to guilt me into going. She yelled at me that she wasnt trying to guilttrip me but just stating facts.\nI then told her that it is a fact that she's forcing me to go out for dinner at a restaurant and neglect my health for a birthday to please her.\nShe got mad and told me to think things over and expects me to go. I just turned around and went back to where i came from.\nI called GM afterwards telling her i probably won't be coming to her bday because of health issues.

I told her i was still in cruciating pain and didnt sleep the past days as i couldnt find a position to sleep in and had migraine because the lack of sleep.

We have been married for 4 years. He always makes excuses that he's working overtime and when he isn't he says that he is hanging out with his friends. I want him home so he can help around with our 8 month old. I work part time. My mom is the one who watches my son while Im at work and when I come home she leaves. Taking care of a baby is hard by yourself and I want my husband to help since our son is his child too. I got tired of him coming home late and asked if I can hang out with these friends. He was quiet then with an attitude told me I can come. I tried to calm myself saying that Im overreacting and I shouldn't act like this. I hired a babysitter for the day bc I didn't want to bother my mom. We didn't really talk on the car ride there. When we get to his friends house it was very awkward. I wasn't really close with these people and so it was weird there. Everyone there was staring at me and I was confused as to why they were looking at me. The hangout was just a BBQ and a football game. Anyways when I finally felt comfortable I actually had a good time and met a really nice girl. She also is a mother and her baby is 10 months. We both aren't into football so We talked majority of the time. When the football game was over I go and wanted to see what my husband was doing. When I go to the living room I saw a girl basically cuddling my husband. She was smiling at me and gave me a smug look. I  got angry. He told me that she was just an old friend from high school. I then find out that they are coworkers as well. So my husband and I were having a fight in front of all his friends. Then a friend of his got tired and said that my husband was cheating on me with that girl. He said that everyone knew and that's why Im not invited to these hangouts. Everything suddenly made sense to me, my husband coming home late, his friends staring at me since they knew, and my husband lying. I told my husband he wasn't allowed back inside the house and not to come near me or my son again.\n\nI felt so angry and felt stupid that there was so many red flags that I missed. I was angry and I wasn't thinking. So I packed most of his things and threw them outside. Since he wasn't going to live in this house anymore. He's been calling and texting me but I've been ignoring them. I have no motivation to do anything now. My sister has been a great help and she told me that she's moving in to help me and my baby. Im planning on getting a divorce. I don't want to stay married with him. But we have a baby together and I don't know what to do. I want my son to go up in a house with both his parents.\n\nHis family called me and are saying that im a asshole for kicking him out of the house since it is his house as well not just mine. But my friends and family say im not because he's a cheater and he never really was involved in our sons life.\n\nSo AITA?", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1632033277.0, "author_fullname": "throwaway283791328", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pr2u19/aita_for_kicking_my_husband_out_of_our_house/"}, {"title": "AITA for throwing up on my bathroom floor instead of in the toilet", "content": "Warning.

Of course, if a fellow coworker has a period emergency I am happy to give her a pad or tampon or a over-the-counter painkiller. One pack of ten pads costs like 120 out of my 20k currency (not US dollars), so while it isn\u2019t cheap, it\u2019s affordable.

Most of the house is quite messy, so the only room she is allowed in is the family room.\n\nHowever, I did not realise that they literally were going to refuse to have anything to do with the dog. This shocked me as they both love dogs. They refuse to play or pat her, or stop her from doing bad things. Some examples of situations where I think they should have helped out.\n\n1) our house backs onto the bush and mum was coming back from a walk and opened the gate. Dog escapes. I was at Uni at the time. Mum doesn't look for her or contact me. She closes the back gate.

He doesn't tell me she might have eaten the bait. I go to bed, but I come back out for a drink. I see the dog covered in vomit and poo, whimpering. She almost died\n\nI try keep her as safe and secure as possible but some things are beyond my control.

Long story short: the dog had chewed the only existing photos of my dad and his mum, which my dad had left on his bedroom floor. Dad went into a rage, blaming me and the dog. Everything is my fault because she is my dog. I put my foot down and said \"everytime she escapes, it's because of you, she never escapes when I am leaving, you never help, and mum had given me the impression that she would get the dog during the exam!\n\nI've spent this weekend cleaning the office of mum and dad's junk, so she can be with me at all times, even during study/class.

In another, I\u2019m friends with Elle (f16). They\u2019re sisters. Elle and I sorta hang out more because we\u2019re in the same grade and have classes together, but I really like Jane. She\u2019s just so kind to everyone. Jane is dating Cody (m16) who is another friend of mine. \n\nJane was upset because there\u2019s a rumor going around that she has an sti. This started going around right when Jane and Cody started dating. He, the awesome guy that he is, didn\u2019t give a shit, saying that their sexual health is between just them. (Seriously, he\u2019s great.) Jane was of course very embarrassed. \n\nOne day, Elle and I were walking when she started talking about Cody. She said that he and Jane shouldn\u2019t be together cause Jane has an sti. I stopped dead in my tracks and asked why she\u2019d say that. She just shrugged it off! She said that it\u2019s true and it\u2019s why they should break up. I asked who told her that. Elle said that she knows cause she\u2019s her sister. I asked her who she told and she said \u201cI dunno, a few people.\u201d\n\nI left shortly after because I felt really uncomfortable. I considered what to do as I walked back to school. But the only right thing I could think of was to tell Jane. I pulled her aside after school and sat her down in a quiet stairwell so that we couldn\u2019t be heard. I told her as gently as I could what Elle had said. Of course, she was shocked and disgusted. She cried a little, we talked a little. But it was as private of an affair as I could do at the time. She composed herself and left for the day. \n\nLater that night, my phone starts blowing up with Elle calling me every name under the sun. Cody also texted me to confirm what I had told Jane. I did so without details out of respect for Jane. Elle kinda threatened me a bit but I doubt she\u2019d ever actually do anything considering I can hold my own very well. \n\nThe problem I\u2019d that since then, Elle has gone around and told people what happened and everyone is saying I should have just stayed out of it and not caused drama. But to me, it\u2019s not just one of my friends talking shit about the other. It\u2019s a sister spreading really hurtful and damaging lies about the other to anyone born with ears. Not to mention that Elle started this by spreading rumors. I also told Jane privately and didn\u2019t make a scene of anything.I asked my older brother because he goes to our school too. He said I should have stayed out of it. But I argued that if he was going around our school and telling everyone I had herpes, you bet your ass I\u2019d want to know. \n\nJane appreciates that I immediately told her the truth and Cody appreciates me looking out for their relationship and for his girlfriend. And to me, that\u2019s all that really matters.
