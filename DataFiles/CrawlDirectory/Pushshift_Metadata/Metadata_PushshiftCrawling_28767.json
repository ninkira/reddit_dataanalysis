Frankly, I think it\u2019s hilarious she thinks she can tell me what to do or control my actions in any way, so my best friend and I decided to prank her.\n\nThe girl was sitting in the library at lunch where she always sits, probably since no one ever wants to sit with her in the lunch room. My friend had a test to make up from when she was absent and the teacher gave it to her to go take in the library. My friend and I sat at the table next to the girl, and I pretended to write down all her answers while she took the test. I kept asking her for the answers and writing things like I was cheating.\n\nLike we thought, the girl fell for it and decided to butt into our business. She reported us to the teacher. I had already taken the test, and my teacher could clearly see my friend and I put different answers for things. So she knew we didn\u2019t cheat and asked why the girl was saying this. I said that the girl has threatened me before that she will report me for cheating (which is completely true) and that I think she just likes to bully us and threaten us. My teacher said she\u2019s going to take action in accordance with the bullying handbook.\n\nSince there was proof we didn\u2019t cheat, the girl will probably be suspended for threatening and bullying, since that\u2019s the zero-tolerance policy in the bullying handbook.

I really love it and it makes me look really cute. When I got home, my mom said \u201cwhat the fuck have you done with your hair? You don\u2019t look good at all\u201d. I ignored her. I went to my room. I showed my hair to my siblings(18f and 12m) and they loved it. My mom again came to our room and said, \"You look like a monkey. This hair doesn\u2019t suit you at all. You look like a crazy woman.\u201d She was nagging and nagging. Even my sister got annoyed and said, \"it's just her hair, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d She didn\u2019t stop.

I am not really dying to talk to her. And this morning my father came to my room and said, \"What is wrong with your hair? You have got too much freedom. You are out of control\u201d.\n\nThe haircut I got is just bangs and layers. That\u2019s it. \n\nI said what I said because whatever I do is always an issue to my mom. The last time I got my hair dyed, she yelled at me saying, \u201cyou have got too much freedom. Who told you to get your hair dyed and who gave you money?\u201d I kept silent at the time. I never ask my parents for money. I buy dresses for myself. They pay for my studies. That\u2019s it. And trust me when I say this, I have studied through scholarships for most of my life. They are paying almost 4000$ for my undergrad. I even buy my siblings lunch almost everyday when my parents go to work without giving them pocket money. I always buy dresses for my sister. I help mom with dishes. In fact, I do all the dishes, every time.

Another thing that really annoys me is she is always calling between 2-4am even when I told her I have work and I get up at 5am and not to call me so late (she has never respected this boundary). On this night I snapped and I told her I was very worried for her and that she desperately needed to get help bc I didn\u2019t want to bury my sister.

He has been through terrible tragedy before, losing his previous serious girlfriend about 5 years ago. He unfortunately recently went through another horrible tragedy, losing his home to a forest fire. Him and his girlfriend are safe. They were able to evacuate, get out almost all of their belongings and help neighbors evacuate too. I cannot imagine how bad it would feel to experience the amount of loss that he has. Luckily, he has a place to live temporarily through friends and a great support system.\n\nMy FIL set up a gofundme, with my BIL approving it and advertising it. The goal was to help raise money for what was lost, what may not be covered under insurance and to help them get by in the meantime. I happily donated a generous amount, and I spread the word to my friends and family. I wanted to help, and I figured even every little bit would be helpful. Many of my family members donated generous amounts as well. The gofundme was successful in fundraising a solid amount of money, and I was grateful.\n\nA week or two later, he proposed to his girlfriend. They had been together long enough and are a good match. Everyone is happy that there is some positive news for them after such an awful situation. I am happy for them too.\n\nHowever, he proposed with a decently-sized diamond ring. I learned that he bought the ring after all the fundraising. He did not have the ring before the fire. The fire was the catalyst for the proposal. I told my wife that it felt wrong that he bought an expensive ring after asking for and accepting donations. I feel that the money was given to help him rebuild and get by in other ways. Of course it is his money to do what he wants with it, and this is rising from the ashes in just a different way than what I was intending to contribute.\n\nMy wife argues that he was planning on proposing before, and that he had the money for the ring already. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say this is true. However, if he had enough money for an expensive ring, then he didn\u2019t truly need a gofundme. In my opinion, he should have gotten her a more affordable ring considering the circumstances. \n\nMy wife sees nothing wrong with the situation, and she said she couldn\u2019t believe that I thought her brother was such a horrible person and would do such a thing. I don\u2019t, and I feel sorry for what he has been through. I\u2019m happy that he has some good news. The timeline of events with the fundraising just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I feel taken advantage of, in a way. I also feel bad for encouraging my friends and family to help.

So any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIt was my (48F) Birthday a few days ago and i was celebrating with my husband (50M) and my two kids, the day started out great but that changed around 11AM that morning when my husband confronted me about dinner - some context, usually when someone in our family has a birthday both my parents and my husbands parents will come around that night for dinner, I had invited my parents but not my husbands parents for a few reasons, 1: we had just gotten out of a level 4 lock down where we are living and his parents would have to travel to come to the dinner which are PM is advising we don't do at the moment, 2: me and his parents have never really gotten along that well, we are civil with each other but they don't like me very much. 3: i just want a quiet evening with my parents my husband and children.\n\nSo my husband confronted me about not inviting his parents and i told him those reasons but he was still mad at me and just walked off without saying anything, my parents come around and while they're here hes acting fine with me but the moment they leave he's back to silence again. A day passes and he's still giving me the silent treatment so i ask him why he's still mad at me, and he say's hes not mad at me, obviously this upsets me and we start yelling, i'm yelling about how he's giving me the worst birthday ever and how i don't deserve his silent treatment, and he's yelling about how he's doing no such thing. He walks away mid argument and go to walk into my room just to turn around too see my kids standing there, the youngest (12M) crying for me, since me and his father don't fight like this.\n\nWe just ate dinner and i was met more silence from my husband and my kids trying to stop dinner from being so quiet and awkward. So reddit AITA for this fight? i don't really think it was such a big deal, as he hardly speaks to his parents anyways, - maybe a couple times a month at most - if it really was so big to him i don't know why he couldn't of just talked it out with me civilly.", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1632121462.0, "author_fullname": "psyhco_goat", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/prpkps/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_not_inviting_my_inlaws/"}, {"title": "WIBTA if I kick my boyfriend out?", "content": "[removed]", "verdict": null, "score": 1.0, "created": 1632121569.0, "author_fullname": "Dangerous-Sun-9878", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/prplj4/wibta_if_i_kick_my_boyfriend_out/"}, {"title": "WIBTA for taking my for taking my sister to small claims court", "content": "So I'm considering taking my (M22) sister (F19) to court for damages since she destroyed my iPad pro by accidently stepping on it.

I have since taken it to the apple store to get see how much the repair would end up costing me and they quoted me 800 dollars and when bringing it up to my sister, who has been ignoring me and interrupts me at any mention of the subject, she yelled at me saying that there is no way that she's going to pay that much since she is saving up for a new car as she has crashed her most recent one. She has been looking for the cheapest repair places in our area and going as far as to say that she found a place over an hour away and told me that I'd have to drive there to see about doing the repair since she doesn't want to go. This severely affects me with my art career and she just doesn't seem to realize that.

We have been on a couple of dates and couldn't meet more often because of Covid. Last night I fell asleep while on phone with her. She was telling me some story and I was listening and then all of sudden I wake up from the sound of phone disconnecting. I realized I fell asleep and then I messaged her and tried calling but she turned off her phone. In the morning after a few attempts and a long message she said she is angry because I fell asleep and started \"snoring\" while we were talking.\n\nNow I understand why she is angry and it is my fault for falling asleep and I have even apologized. However what is bugging me is how much angry she is and she wouldn't even say anything for a long time. Is falling asleep an asshole behavior? I try to be respectful but at the same time I don't want to be apologizing too much for something I consider a honest mistake. Or maybe it is a major issue for most people and I am just blind to it.\n\nWe both are 29 years old and I am a guy.", "verdict": "Not the A-hole", "score": 1.0, "created": 1632121771.0, "author_fullname": "texas_laramie", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/prpn4o/aita_for_falling_asleep_while_talking_on_phone/"}]
