        "content": "My fiance (30M) and I (28F) are getting married next month. Everything is going great, but we've been having a serious argument about having his grandmother at our wedding. \n\nWe've agreed to not have kids at our wedding, as we want the reception to be a huge party for your adult friends and family with dancing, loud music and an open bar. However, for precisely the same reasons that we don't want kids there, I don't want his elderly grandmother at our wedding either. I said she can come to the ceremony but not the reception. It will be extremely loud and I want it to be a party atmosphere, and she will be extremely out of place. For context, none of my grandparents are still alive, and he still has his last living grandmother. \n\nThis has caused a huge fight, since she said she has always dreamed about being at her grandson's wedding (he is her oldest grandchild and she probably won't make it to the next family wedding). Which is why I said that she's more than welcome at the ceremony, but she will just be too out of place at the reception. She and he both insist that she will be fine and wants to go to the party. But I just know it will inevitably lead to us dealing with her and taking care of her, and I just want to get drunk and let loose with my friends. \n\nShe's now really upset and won't talk to me, and my fiance is also angry. I think I am within my right to make this request, I am the bride after all. \n\nAITA?",

Why would it be your responsibility to look after her, what about her children or other grand children, can you not ask one of them to keep an eye on her? \nShe may also surprise you.\n I also had a child free wedding, for the same reasons - evening back-tie wedding with open bar, cocktail waiter and late night karaoke. The wedding was in my parents garden and my husband's family had to fly to attend. He has a pair of very religious bachelor uncles, who don't approve of alcohol, had lived with their mother all their lives (they were in their 60s), both had minor disabilities and had never travelled outside of their part of the country. We invited them, of course, but didn't really expect them to attend. We had even planned to hold a small event in their country so they could still be included. We were a little apprehensive, but you know what? They did attend, resplendent in tuxedos and had the adventure of their lives.  My Mother-in-law was the MVP (they are not her brothers) and took care of them - they had never even flown before, and had a wonderful time sharing this new experience with everyone. We made some minor adjustments to add some plainer foods to the buffet as it was an ethnic cuisine and they have very simple tastes, but it was little effort on our part.\nThey talked about it constantly for months, and they lit up when they did so, and looking back it is such a precious memory for everyone, especially as we lost one of them last year.\nPlease think long and hard before taking this precious time away from both her and your future husband. She is 98 - she's seen it all before, she is unlikely to be shocked by any of the activities, even if she isn't up to joining in anymore, will probably just be happy to see everyone else enjoying themselves.",

In my wedding, there were both very old people and very young kids, and we had a blast. Instead of centering them around my needs, I took care of theirs: dedicated table for children with childcare and entertainment, so their parents could enjoy my wedding, and different mini buses going to different locations just after dinner for those who didn't want to stay when the loud music started. So the \"grandmas\" could stay for dinner, enjoy a conversation with their loved ones and then go safely home.",

        "content": "My husband's paternal grandmother has an \"oh don't worry, everything will work out fine\" mentality. I didn't think it extended to *the safety of newborn babies* though, or I never would've let her babysit my 3mo son, even for just 3 hours. About a week and a half ago while she was babysitting, I got a call from her saying my son had \"a bit of a tumble\".\n\nI heard my son *screaming* in the background and my instincts said something was extremely wrong, so I said to get off the phone with me and call an ambulance, then call me back and tell me what happened once the ambulance was on the way. She started handwaving it with \"I don't think we need to bother with an ambulance, babies are tougher than they look you know, basically made of rubber.\"\n\nWhen I said he sounded like he was hurt she admitted he had \"a bit of a scrape and a bruise\" and when I pushed further she said it was on his head. I hung up and called the ambulance myself because I wasn't about to sit there and waste time trying to convince this idiot that a *head injury on a 3mo baby* is a serious thing.\n\nMy absolute hero of a boss drove me to the hospital because I was in no state to drive, and I needed to be on the phone to notify my husband and then get the full story from his grandmother. It turns out she not only dropped my son, she dropped him while walking down the stairs, so he fell onto the second from bottom step and hit his head on the third from bottom step. She then wasted time *calling her son*, who told her she should probably call me or my husband.\n\nAt the hospital she kept being dismissive, saying I was overreacting and my son would be fine, until I made her leave. As it turns out, my son has a minor fracture in his skull, which will heal on its own, though it will take a couple of months. We're so incredibly lucky. The doctor said a fall like that could have easily caused a life threatening brain injury, and my husband's grandmother hesitating to call an ambulance absolutely could have increased his risk of serious disability or death.\n\nI was furious with her, but I felt she should know my son was ok so I called her, but when she answered me call with \"what did I tell you, he's fine, isn't he?\" Her condescending tone and blas\u00e9 attitude to my son's safety pissed me off, so I said \"actually we're still not sure if he's going to make it.\" Then the apologies and the guilt and the distress came out.\n\nMy husband called her later to tell her my son would be fine. My husband's father and grandmother are really mad, they think it was a dirty trick to lie to an old lady about her great grandson's injury, but my husband and I maintain that she deserved to feel bad about what happened to my son, and she obviously wasn't until she thought his life was in danger. I for one will never let her near my son again, but I hope she'll now be more careful about the safety of any other children she has care over.",

If you ask me, this lady needed (and in future needs) to hear a no-nonsense, this-is-were-it's-at \"due to your negligence, when he fell on his head, the skull cracked. this will take at least x months to heal, and \\[...\\]\".

        "title": "AITA for \"embarrassing\" my husband in front of his co-worker?",
        "content": "My (33F) husband (37m) and I recently had our first child (5mos). We decided I would stay home with the baby. Previously, I worked freelance from home but have always had a healthy savings and a decent amount of assets acquired before marriage\u2014including our house, which has no mortgage and is a two-family home. We rent out the top unit. \n\nBaby and I went to pick up husband from work as his car was in the shop and husband wanted me to meet one of his co-workers, Sam. We all sat outside in the courtyard and chatted. Sam is a few years younger than my husband and I suspect my husband sees himself as a bit of a mentor to the guy. We were having a nice conversation about life and kids and eventually the topic of working overtime came up. The company needs a few extra guys over the weekend and offered overtime to the whole department. My husband asked Sam if he was planning to come in and Sam said no that he had plans to go to the beach with his girlfriend and child. I commented that that sounded like a nice weekend but my husband interjected that if Sam was as concerned with money as he has claimed to be in the past, he shouldn\u2019t be passing up overtime opportunities. From context and a later conversation with my husband, it sounds like Sam has griped about not making enough money in the past. \n\nMy husband plans to take the overtime and told Sam so. Sam countered that he wasn\u2019t going to give up his weekend for a few extra bucks and stated that my husband doesn\u2019t understand because my husband makes more than he does (husband is in a higher position and makes roughly $12 more an hour). My husband\u2019s response was that his higher pay doesn\u2019t matter because his partner (me, who was sitting right there) doesn\u2019t work and he's the sole provider so he has to bust his ass anyway. He then insisted that Sam actually has it easier than he does because Sam\u2019s partner also works and they have two incomes. \n\nI rolled my eyes, a little annoyed at being talked about like I wasn\u2019t there, and pointed out that my husband\u2019s partner (me) owns an income-producing house and we not only don\u2019t have to worry about rent or a mortgage like Sam does, but also have a tenant whose rent subsidizes our expenses. I also threw in the fact that we don\u2019t need to pay for childcare either. Sam laughed and said \u201cYou see! You don\u2019t have it so bad! Why are you always complaining?!\u201d But my husband was pissed and I could tell he was a little flustered by the whole exchange. When we got in the car he accused me of embarrassing him in front of a guy he was just trying to show the \u201cright way\u201d to. I told him I don't appreciate him acting like I don\u2019t contribute to the household when I\u2019m not only raising our child and taking care of the home but have also made significant financial contributions. This isn't the only time he's touted himself as \"sole provider\" or referred to us as a \"single-income family\". He brushed it off and said it\u2019s not that serious and that \u201ctechnically\u201d we are a single-income family.",

I also know my husband is insecure about the fact that I owned our home before we were married and disregarded his insecurities because I felt personally disrespected by his statements. Plus, I suppose it wouldn't have hurt me to let my husband play the big strong provider for his co-workers as I generally don't see them but took my husband's dismissal of my financial contributions personally and made them public.\n\n---\n\n Help keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\n Do upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Family &amp; relationship time matters too, and I think the younger generations saw their parents working too much and the kids suffered in the divorces (along with other reasons divorces happen).

What a jerk. \n\nSAHM\u2019s do not get near the credit they deserve. My wife was a SAHM mom for a few years. Our youngest is on the spectrum. Her contributions were every bit as much as mine. People would try to downplay it, but I always set them straight. Even though she wasn\u2019t earning an income she was contributing financially because of the costs saved from childcare. The money saved was significant and it was because of her staying home. The financial savings were directly because of her being home with our child. People need to take a step back and realize that the contributions of a SAHP are just as significant as the one who works outside of the home. \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP. Your husband needs therapy or something. You contribute financially as well as by being a SAHM. I hope you realize how important your contributions are. You\u2019re amazing and I hope your husband can start to understand that as well. Instead of focusing on what he feels is his \u201csuffering\u201d, he should focus on all of the positives.

We decided I would stay home with the baby. Previously, I worked freelance from home but have always had a healthy savings and a decent amount of assets acquired before marriage\u2014including our house, which has no mortgage and is a two-family home. We rent out the top unit. \n\nBaby and I went to pick up husband from work as his car was in the shop and husband wanted me to meet one of his co-workers, Sam. We all sat outside in the courtyard and chatted. Sam is a few years younger than my husband and I suspect my husband sees himself as a bit of a mentor to the guy. We were having a nice conversation about life and kids and eventually the topic of working overtime came up. The company needs a few extra guys over the weekend and offered overtime to the whole department. My husband asked Sam if he was planning to come in and Sam said no that he had plans to go to the beach with his girlfriend and child. I commented that that sounded like a nice weekend but my husband interjected that if Sam was as concerned with money as he has claimed to be in the past, he shouldn\u2019t be passing up overtime opportunities. From context and a later conversation with my husband, it sounds like Sam has griped about not making enough money in the past. \n\nMy husband plans to take the overtime and told Sam so. Sam countered that he wasn\u2019t going to give up his weekend for a few extra bucks and stated that my husband doesn\u2019t understand because my husband makes more than he does (husband is in a higher position and makes roughly $12 more an hour). My husband\u2019s response was that his higher pay doesn\u2019t matter because his partner (me, who was sitting right there) doesn\u2019t work and he's the sole provider so he has to bust his ass anyway. He then insisted that Sam actually has it easier than he does because Sam\u2019s partner also works and they have two incomes. \n\nI rolled my eyes, a little annoyed at being talked about like I wasn\u2019t there, and pointed out that my husband\u2019s partner (me) owns an income-producing house and we not only don\u2019t have to worry about rent or a mortgage like Sam does, but also have a tenant whose rent subsidizes our expenses. I also threw in the fact that we don\u2019t need to pay for childcare either. Sam laughed and said \u201cYou see! You don\u2019t have it so bad! Why are you always complaining?!\u201d But my husband was pissed and I could tell he was a little flustered by the whole exchange. When we got in the car he accused me of embarrassing him in front of a guy he was just trying to show the \u201cright way\u201d to. I told him I don't appreciate him acting like I don\u2019t contribute to the household when I\u2019m not only raising our child and taking care of the home but have also made significant financial contributions. This isn't the only time he's touted himself as \"sole provider\" or referred to us as a \"single-income family\". He brushed it off and said it\u2019s not that serious and that \u201ctechnically\u201d we are a single-income family.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He waited till after you accepted and got home to ask for \u00a320, at least Uber tells you the costs upfront.\n\nTotal the favours you've done for him recently, itemise the bill and tell him cash or credit will be fine. If he's going to price-gouge you for a favour, least you can do is charge him back.\n\nAnd also, be wary if this is a pattern.

It is \u00a320 to get an Uber home. I used the app often enough that I get regular discounts up to 30%. My boyfriend offered to pick me up from work after I told him the price of the Uber sometimes. He got us home. It\u2019s a 30 minute ride, about 20 miles. Afterwards he asked me to pay him; I said fine I don\u2019t mind paying petrol costs. He said I\u2019d have to give him \u00a320 because he went out of his way to get me and I would have given it to the Uber driver anyway. He insists that it makes no sense for me not to pay him what I\u2019d would give to the Uber driver. I told him that\u2019s different because he\u2019s my boyfriend and an Uber driver is a service.\n\nI told him I\u2019d give him \u00a310 which he wasn\u2019t happy about it. \n\nAITA for not giving him what I would give for an Uber driver? \n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019d pay the price of a Starbucks coffee if my BF made me a cup of coffee.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "title": "AITA for making my brother leave after he brought his kids to my child free wedding?",
        "content": "\n\nMy wife and I got married days ago. We decided the wedding will be child free. We thought this was the best option considering several factors from budget to keeping the order, etc.\nEveryone got an invitation but my biggest concern was how my brother *Ramsey 36* was going to react.\nRamsey married young and has 4 kids that he takes everywhere he and his wife go. They're always there at every family event. The kids are grade A, hyper active to say the least.\n\n\nI gave Ramsey the invitation in person and he read it out loud in a sarcastic tone then said *\"child free, ha?\"* I noded and he got somewhat mad saying *\"Are you serious?, But my children never been excluded from any event big or small let alone their own uncle's wedding\"*. I said I'm sorry but it's already been decided and everyone had to follow the rules not just him.\nHe stared off for a minute then to my surprise he said *\" I totally get it man, no children means no children, no worries\"* I was glad he didn't start an argument over it and seemed to accept the rule.\n\nThe day of the wedding came and Ramsey and his wife didn't show up until shortly before the ceremony began. My best man notified me that Ramsey had arrived and had all his kids with him. I was legit mad I went to meet him at the entrance and saw he brought all his kids against me and my wife's wishes. I greeted the kids and asked my SIL to take them back to the car. He loudly asked wtf was wrong with me. I asked why he brought his kids and who said it was ok. he said no one but he was planning on bringing the kids all along and figured that by *initially* agreeing to my rule then showing up with the kids *anyway* would get me to agree on letting them stay. I stated this was no event for kids for many reasons and that everyone respected the rule except him. He complained about me disrespecting him and his kids since, again, he never attends any event without them. in his words *\"where-ever I go, my kids follow, period\"*. I told him he needed to leave then.\nNot only did he call me a lunatic but a terrible brother and terrible uncle. He also called me a simp for agreeing to my wife's *\"stupid\"* rule saying if that was him and his wife even hinted he couldn't have the family's kids at their wedding he would've dropped her right there right then. It was humiliating and loud enough for the guests to notice. My inlaws did too. I told him to leave that's when my mom and aunt tried to convince me to let it go and let them stay but I refused and had him leave after a massive argument between us. To say that I felt absolutely shitty is an understatement.\n\n\nEveryone gave me grief eversince that incident and are siding with Ramsey saying I wronged him and acted cold towards him and his kids when they showed up to celebrate me and my wife. My dad is especially pissed at me for potentially, permenantly fucking up my relationship with Ramsey, his wife and kids by kicking them out of my wedding. He quoted Ramsey wont ever forget this day.\n\nAITA?",

But you both sound pretty immature, TBH.\n\nWe had a child free wedding, but we still understood that people had kids, and helped them arrange for babysitters (which we wrapped into our wedding budget\u2014an utterly insignificant amount in the grand scheme of things). Even so, one of our friends didn't feel comfortable leaving her newborn behind. So you know what we did? We rolled with it. Because ultimately, the most important thing about a wedding is that the people you love are there to celebrate with you.\n\nThis is the thing so many people don't understand about weddings. It's not, actually, about you spoiling yourself, and being selfish, and indulging all your worst instincts, and never compromising on your \"special day\". It's about you trying to be your best self. Because if you can't be your best self on your wedding day, and be generous to your guests, and rolling with the unexpected, how can you expect to be your best self within a marriage\u2014which is, at the end of the day, the supposed point of it all.\n\nWhich is not to say that you should accept toxic or abusive behavior at your wedding. But frankly? I'm not sure that your brother's behavior (which was dishonest)  qualifies. I'm certainly not sure it justifies kicking your nieces and nephews out, once they were there. They were innocents, who certainly felt rejected by you, and whom  you could not turn away without humiliating their Dad.\n\nDid you really have to escalate this situation out of pride? Could you really not find it within yourself to be more gracious than your brother?  Because whether your brother was a dick or not here, you still had a choice here. And your choice was to turn people you purportedly love away from your special day, when you had it in you to be generous instead.",

And it is disrespectful of you to want it your way? \n\nSure, you should just forget the fact that your brother LIED and said he wouldn't bring his kids, PLOTTED to MANIPULATE you and your wife into allowing the kids by throwing them into the mix at the wedding venue. He then CAUSED A SCENE at your wedding because you asked him to leave. \n\nWhat is your family thinking? Why should your wedding be about him at all?! \n\nIf he came to celebrate you, he would have left the kids with a sitter, or one of his wife's family members. He came with his kids to show you up. He walked in like he did nothing wrong (knowing he did!). He didn't leave right away when asked, either. He is basically saying your words mean nothing to him and he will do what he wants and you can do nothing about it. And you family clapped back with Yeah, how about that!\n\nNext time a family member brings  it up and blames you, tell them to stop on that subject. Tell them they were being as disrespectful as your brother be backing him. And if they want to argue about it until forever, they should go talk to your brother. Because your done discussing it. (Parents often work the nice kid to get him to accept the siblings bad actions because they know the mean sibling will never give in - so not fair!)\n\nUnfortunately, you can do nothing about it now. Just be glad he is the socially stupid one in the family instead of it being you! \n\nAnd congratulations!!!",

                "content": "NTA\n\nIs a mat. If it scares kids, too bad. Kids get scared of the most irrational things and you cannot expect anyone to cater to their irrational fears. I had freakouts because The Simpsons scared me. One of my neighbours watched it in their own home with their tv facing the windows and I could see it when I walked passed. It was scary so I freaked out. Instead of telling the neighbour what to do, my parents reassured me that it could not hurt me and to mind my own business and not look into neighbours houses. \n\nMy brother was freaked out by a giant, decorative frog that was next to another neighbours mailbox. Once again he was taught that it will not harm him and to look away if it really freaked him out.\n\nThese kids will be exposed to non harmful scary things in life anyway. They will need to get over it. It is up to their parents to teach them that the mat will not harm them, the clown will not harm them and what an optical illusion is. \n\nAnd complaining to the office over a mat? Who gets this worked up over a mat? And who has the time to complain about something so small?\n\nIts a mat that means a lot to you, and sounds pretty cool. Keep it. (however, this entitled lady sounds like the type to steal and destroy property to keep her kids happy so your mat may be vulnerable. Maybe find a copy and put that out and keep the sentimental original in a safe place?",

Someone could accidentally damage it or pets could pee on it. If it's that precious to you, I would definitely take it inside my house.\n\nYou might be legally or technically in the right, but OP it's never wise to antagonize the landlord. Heck, it's not wise to antagonize neighbors, either. But what if several people in the building are actually disturbed by the mat, and only one neighbor had the decency to approach you personally about it? If the landlord gets enough complaints, they could just make it harder for you to live there. Raise the rent as much as they can each renewal contract, take the longest time to fix your stuff or whatever. Just not wise in general.",

You don't know what other things the kids might be going through and the mat just pushes them over the edge everytime they see it. I've known plenty of children, myself included, who have gone through truly horrible and terrifying things, which causes them to become super scared of anything and everything. Of course being scared of a inanimate welcome mat isn't rational but kids aren't known for their logic at the best of times. \n\nMaybe the kids are just scared because it's a scary looking picture. Or maybe they're dealing with stuff and the pretend scary outside your front door is too much on top of the real scary that they're going through. It's probably the former but my point is, you just don't know. You're not obligated to have empathy for others, nor are you obligated to in anyway do anything to help others, but it is generally considered an AH move if you don't at least try.\n\nBring your mat indoors. If it's as sentimental as you say it is why would you want to run the risk of it getting damaged, dirty, or stolen? Also wouldn't you want to look at it all the time, since it's sentimental?",

My parents originate from Turkey but I'm not really sure how common it is for Muslim families in America to do what they do. Basically, my parents and their friends have these family get togethers quite often and call people to their house. Ok, cool - nothing wrong with that I've been going to them since I was a kid and they can be pretty fun. However - and this is a big fucking however, since I turned 18 it become so different. At these get togethers, my parents would introduce me to their friends' sons who I've know since I was little and they would act as if we've never met and just stare at us from a distance after trying to get us to talk. It's so fucking awkward and they do it with like all of their friends' sons. They introduce me to all these guys and act as if it's some fucking speed dating event for me and I have even overheard my parents talking about trying to find a guy for me. It's just so fucking weird and annoying knowing that these 'get togethers' are just a way for them to try and find a guy for me.\n\nA while back my parents were having one of these get togethers with their friends and had told them I would be there. I simply left the house and went somewhere else with a couple of friends and didnt turn up to the party. Now my parents are super pissed and angry that I was rude by not attending the party and that I embarrassed them in front of their friends by not turning up and being disobedient.\n\nI've told my parents many times that I don't like it when they try and find a guy for me since it's just weird but they just go on a rant about how I've 'lost my way' and won't get married. Like I'm 19 lol...I'm not getting married anytime soon.\n\nWhilst I'm fed up of those parties, I did suppose it was pretty rude of me to just not turn up when I had originally told my parents I would be there. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: wow. Firstly I'd really like to thank everyone here for being so helpful. I made this post because I felt bad for ghosting my parents when I had originally agreed to go to their party. Reading all your comments has really opened my eyes into some of the things I need to be careful of like keeping all my legal documents with me etc. Thanks guys.",

My parents originate from Turkey but I'm not really sure how common it is for Muslim families in America to do what they do. Basically, my parents and their friends have these family get togethers quite often and call people to their house. Ok, cool - nothing wrong with that I've been going to them since I was a kid and they can be pretty fun. However - and this is a big fucking however, since I turned 18 it become so different. At these get togethers, my parents would introduce me to their friends' sons who I've know since I was little and they would act as if we've never met and just stare at us from a distance after trying to get us to talk. It's so fucking awkward and they do it with like all of their friends' sons. They introduce me to all these guys and act as if it's some fucking speed dating event for me and I have even overheard my parents talking about trying to find a guy for me. It's just so fucking weird and annoying knowing that these 'get togethers' are just a way for them to try and find a guy for me.\n\nA while back my parents were having one of these get togethers with their friends and had told them I would be there. I simply left the house and went somewhere else with a couple of friends and didnt turn up to the party. Now my parents are super pissed and angry that I was rude by not attending the party and that I embarrassed them in front of their friends by not turning up and being disobedient.\n\nI've told my parents many times that I don't like it when they try and find a guy for me since it's just weird but they just go on a rant about how I've 'lost my way' and won't get married. Like I'm 19 lol...I'm not getting married anytime soon.\n\nWhilst I'm fed up of those parties, I did suppose it was pretty rude of me to just not turn up when I had originally told my parents I would be there. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

You've raised me to be a good and smart person. Please trust in your skills as parents that I will make the right decisions for myself.\"",

You need to advocate for yourself, if that is not possible then you can be a no show for all future dates. I\u2019m not sure if you want a love marriage or no marriage but only you can speak up.

        "content": "I\u2019ve been here for 3 years now and my coworker (let\u2019s call her Amy) has been there for 2.5 years. She has horrible period pain and needs people to switch with her so she doesn\u2019t lose her job. We work as nursing assistants and it\u2019s 12 people in my section, 4 in the daytime, 4 in the afternoon and 4 at night. For like a week every month she needs to be off and have the rest of us switch with her for the following weeks where she works more afternoon and evenings. Sometimes people from other sections would take her shift too but during the pandemic this wasn\u2019t allowed. Since last year there\u2019s a shortage since my other 2 coworkers from my section retired and their hasn\u2019t been enough casual workers to cover everything. I\u2019ve been working her shift and my shift (16h a day) for a week every month since the start of the pandemic for whenever she is off sick. I\u2019m so tried I can\u2019t take it and when she told me she needed to switch again for this week I said I couldn\u2019t. For that entire week she is sick I basically don\u2019t get to see my friends or bf and I was sick of it and told her I wouldn\u2019t do it anymore. She and I got into an argument about it and the manager came to tell us off. \n\nShe used her vacation time since she used up all her sick time already and kept using until her vacation time is over. Then she started taking unpaid days until the manager started warning her that she was taking excessive sick days. Right now we are so short staffed I seriously doubt she will be fired for it, but once things open up no doubt they will hire cheap labor from elsewhere and fire her. She has been extremely passive aggressive towards me for the last months saying one day my period will cause me to scream in pain and no one will be there to help me.",

She has horrible period pain and needs people to switch with her so she doesn\u2019t lose her job. We work as nursing assistants and it\u2019s 12 people in my section, 4 in the daytime, 4 in the afternoon and 4 at night. For like a week every month she needs to be off and have the rest of us switch with her for the following weeks where she works more afternoon and evenings. Sometimes people from other sections would take her shift too but during the pandemic this wasn\u2019t allowed. Since last year there\u2019s a shortage since my other 2 coworkers from my section retired and their hasn\u2019t been enough casual workers to cover everything. I\u2019ve been working her shift and my shift (16h a day) for a week every month since the start of the pandemic for whenever she is off sick. I\u2019m so tried I can\u2019t take it and when she told me she needed to switch again for this week I said I couldn\u2019t. For that entire week she is sick I basically don\u2019t get to see my friends or bf and I was sick of it and told her I wouldn\u2019t do it anymore. She and I got into an argument about it and the manager came to tell us off. \n\nShe used her vacation time since she used up all her sick time already and kept using until her vacation time is over. Then she started taking unpaid days until the manager started warning her that she was taking excessive sick days. Right now we are so short staffed I seriously doubt she will be fired for it, but once things open up no doubt they will hire cheap labor from elsewhere and fire her. She has been extremely passive aggressive towards me for the last months saying one day my period will cause me to scream in pain and no one will be there to help me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because right now all they have is her word her period is that bad. They have no evidence of this. \n\nThis also isn't OP's responsibility. She shouldn't have to work and burn out. No one wants their nurse to be burnt out. We all know nurses run the clinics and offices. This is more of a scheduling issue. The coworker needs to take this up with whoever schedules.

You\u2019ve put up a boundary, and your employer needs to respect that. Part of having and retaining good employees is keeping them from BURNING OUT. The risk of burn out is already high in this field, and working an 80 hour week every month sure doesn\u2019t help. Your manager and HR need to work this one out, not you. Quite frankly, if HR were doing THEIR job, they would be talking to your coworker about other options, like FMLA, doing light duty that week, flexible scheduling, etc. Stick to it on this one.",

        "title": "AITA for refusing to fix my neighbor's landscaping that used to be mine?",
        "content": "I  have rented my house for 10 years 47f.  My neighbor is in her late  80's. Her son is a dick. I take her soup once in a while or a plate of cookies but she always steers the conversation towards things that make me want to forget that I was taught to respect my elders. She makes me very uncomfortable, as does her son. He is at her house 3-4 days a week and a home health aid comes every day.  She\u2019s a cranky old bat and I  just don\u2019t feel like I need to be friends with her.\n\nMy job doesn\u2019t care when I get my work done, as long as it gets done and I  work from home.  I have considerable free time which I have spent on landscaping the backyard. What happened left me HEARTBROKEN. Her son had a land survey done and found out my fence was 10\u2019 too far into their yard. My landlords were notified. The privacy fence came down and a new chain link fence was put up. It\u2019s the whole neighborhood. The mistake was made in the 1950s during construction.  Every house on the street has shifted left 10\u2019 to the left.  Everyone else was able to negotiate a  deal to purchase the strip of land and life continued as before, except for us.  They were able to buy the encroached strip on her lot for  $1.00 plus legal fees.  They refused all offers from us including a  $2,000 offer from the owners.  My house is now 18 inches from the property line which has dropped the value of the house considerably if they ever decide to sell.\n\nI lost the grape arbor and a small brick patio surrounding it, along with all the landscaping and my fairy garden. I did a woodburned  mural on the fence that took me 2 summers to complete. I watched it cut to pieces and tossed in a dumpster. I had to redo a stone walkway and I  lost 2 feet of my patio as well as the only gate to the backyard.\n\nShe  wants me to take care of the arbor and to transplant the flowers and shrubs so they are against the fence. I completely agree that something needs to be done. The entire fence line looks bad.  It wasn\u2019t designed to float in the middle of the yard.  The jasmine, blackberries, and  azaleas are burning in the sun since they lost the shade of the privacy fence. I just don't have the heart to do it. It isn\u2019t mine anymore. I  was told NOT to remove anything from their side of the property before the fence came down and I am a little salty. I politely told her that I  was going to have enough to do repairing my own yard. I gave her the number of a friend who does landscaping and will do it for cost as a  favor to me.\n\nHer son filed a lawsuit against me for \"gardening without permission\".  He will drop the lawsuit if I fix the \u201cmess I made\u201d.\n\nI  have refused pointblank and am no longer answering the door or phone.   My landlord installed a privacy fence which just ticked them off.   They are throwing dead plants, grapes, and even landscaping rocks onto my patio.\n\nAm I the Asshole for not fixing my neighbor's yard?\n\nEDIT:  The lawsuit was filed in General Sessions or small claims court. No lawyers required.  Think The People's Court or Judge Judy.",

My neighbor is in her late  80's. Her son is a dick. I take her soup once in a while or a plate of cookies but she always steers the conversation towards things that make me want to forget that I was taught to respect my elders. She makes me very uncomfortable, as does her son. He is at her house 3-4 days a week and a home health aid comes every day.  She\u2019s a cranky old bat and I  just don\u2019t feel like I need to be friends with her.\n\nMy job doesn\u2019t care when I get my work done, as long as it gets done and I  work from home.  I have considerable free time which I have spent on landscaping the backyard. What happened left me HEARTBROKEN. Her son had a land survey done and found out my fence was 10\u2019 too far into their yard. My landlords were notified. The privacy fence came down and a new chain link fence was put up. It\u2019s the whole neighborhood. The mistake was made in the 1950s during construction.  Every house on the street has shifted left 10\u2019 to the left.  Everyone else was able to negotiate a  deal to purchase the strip of land and life continued as before, except for us.  They were able to buy the encroached strip on her lot for  $1.00 plus legal fees.  They refused all offers from us including a  $2,000 offer from the owners.  My house is now 18 inches from the property line which has dropped the value of the house considerably if they ever decide to sell.\n\nI lost the grape arbor and a small brick patio surrounding it, along with all the landscaping and my fairy garden. I did a woodburned and stain mural on the fence that took me 2 summers to complete. I watched it cut to pieces and tossed in a dumpster. I had to redo a stone walkway and I  lost 2 feet of my patio as well as the only gate to the backyard.\n\nShe  wants me to take care of the arbor and to transplant the flowers and shrubs so they are against the fence. I completely agree that something needs to be done. The entire fence line looks bad.  It wasn\u2019t designed to float in the middle of the yard.  The jasmine, blackberries, and  azaleas are burning in the sun since they lost the shade of the privacy fence. I just don't have the heart to do it. It isn\u2019t mine anymore. I  was told NOT to remove anything from their side of the property before the fence came down and I am a little salty. I politely told her that I  was going to have enough to do repairing my own yard. I gave her the number of a friend who does landscaping and will do it for cost as a  favor to me.\n\nHer son filed a lawsuit against me for \"gardening without permission\".  He will drop the lawsuit if I fix the \u201cmess I made\u201d.\n\nI  have refused point-blank and am no longer answering the door or phone.   My landlord installed a new privacy fence which just ticked them off.   They have started throwing dead plants, grapes, and even landscaping rocks onto my patio.\n\nAm I the Asshole for not fixing my neighbor's yard?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She ended up losing her kids and actively didn't try to see them for three years.\n\nI haven't spoken to my parents in 6 months because they let her move into their new house, after they sold our childhood home to get her out. I am not dealing with their self inflicted drama.\n\nSister is now under going chemo in my town. My mom texted and asked for me to let sister move in for the duration of her treatment. I said no. \n\nMom rebutted that if I didn't let sister stay, her prefered doctor is here, then my parents will either have to drive her an hour and a half one way or she will have to see a different doctor and live with our brother (three hours away).\n\nSo, tell me...am I being the AH by standing my ground?",

She was a thief, liar  and a coke head. She ended up losing her kids and actively didn't try to see them for three years.\n\nI haven't spoken to my parents in 6 months because they let her move into their new house, after they sold our childhood home to get her out. I am not dealing with their self inflicted drama.\n\nSister is now under going chemo in my town. My mom texted and asked for me to let sister move in for the duration of her treatment. I said no. \n\nMom rebutted that if I didn't let sister stay, her prefered doctor is here, then my parents will either have to drive her an hour and a half one way or she will have to see a different doctor and live with our brother (three hours away).\n\nSo, tell me...am I being the AH by standing my ground?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "content": "My daughter is 15. She will be starting Year 11 at school when the summer is over, and the school will be having a prom at the end of the year. \n\nMy wife (44F and a senior accountant) was talking to our daughter about her own school leaving party (it wasn't called a prom back then in the UK) and she mentioned that she still owns the outfit she wore. She showed her a couple of pictures too. \n\nLater when we were getting ready for bed my wife noticed that her wardrobe was open. On closer inspection she saw that the outfit she was discussing earlier was gone. She went into our daughter's room to see her wearing it and taking pictures of herself in the mirror. \n\nObviously having our daughter go into her wardrobe and try on her things without asking was annoying, but I thought my wife's reaction was a little extreme. She asked \"what the fuck do you think you're doing?\" and *demanded* my daughter change out of it immediately. My daughter was almost in tears from how my wife spoke to her. \n\nI tried to speak to my wife about why she was so angry, but she just kept saying our daughter is not to touch her things without permission. I understand this, but I don't see why she's so enraged about it. \n\nMy wife and daughter look very similar. They've even been called sisters in the past. Based on this, I asked if my wife felt jealous at seeing our daughter wear her dress. When I said this she got even more upset and said she was going to sleep in our spare room. She isn't speaking to me today. \n\nDid I go too far with comment? I'm just trying to figure out why my wife was so angry.",

Because the question when your partner is mad is usually \"Why are you mad? \", not \" Are you crazy? \" or something equivalent because a mother that is jealous of her daughter is crazy.\n\nEdit to answer a lot of comments: if the situation were reversed and a son would have taken something from his dad without permission that he hold dear, a car or a baseball bat or a jacket for exemple and he got mad at his son and the mom told him he was jealous, my reaction would have been the same.\n\nAnd for the people that say i normalize abuse, i think this is a one time incident if it wasnt then it is clearly abuse.",

That alone implies such an incredibly awful view of your wife, that you see her as being, on the face of it, somehow **lesser in significant ways than an adolescent child** despite her being an accomplished woman and your life partner, so much so that you think she'd have reason to be jealous of her own kid. It's unbelievably offensive and contemptuous of her, and I don't blame her for being not only furious with you, but terribly hurt.\n\nThe reasonable conclusion, by the way, would have been **to actually believe your wife** when she told you that she was upset at your daughter invading her privacy. While her response may have seemed excessive to you, you could have asked her about it. Perhaps she felt that boundaries had been crossed that were not immediately clear to you, regarding memories over the dress or that time in her life. Perhaps this is not the first time your daughter had disrespected her personal things. Or as others have noted, maybe the dress, years old, was fragile and not meant to be played with.

I've had to say goodbye to COUNTLESS pretty and lovely clothes in the past and trust me, you'll get over it as soon as you find the next pretty dress.

        "content": "This is still a little fresh and for some reason when I (27M) told it to a friend they seem to think I was an asshole for my reaction. I usually work freelance but a buddy of mine owns a small business and desperately looking for new people to hire. He asked me to come in for an interview. This was just a formality since he always wanted me for the position regardless. Tbh I wasn\u2019t so sure I wanted the job but thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to come in anyways. He said I could start part time and work my way to full-time if I like it. \nMy friend left some other guy in charge of interviews, who\u2019s a manager that works under him. Not only was this dude a half hour late but every couple sentences out of my mouth he\u2019d be telling me to pause because his phone would go off and he needed to respond. I Know for a fact it wasn\u2019t work related because who laughs at texts that aren\u2019t personal. Anyways was already annoyed but what really ticked me off was when he looked at my resume and saw my last name. \n\nMy last name is Hummingbird, my dad\u2019s dad came from Native American background although he (and I)  actually don\u2019t know much about it. This guy sees my last name and laughs. He says \u201cwait seriously that\u2019s your last name?\u201d\nTold him yeah what\u2019s the big deal. Guy keeps laughing and he says sorry not judging me just still getting used to some the crazy names people give themselves. He told me this other person who interviewed recently who according to him was obviously a trans female and her name was this ridiculous idk what, but for some reason he found it hilarious. Didn\u2019t think it was funny at all. And he\u2019s laughing because he thinks this is a surname I gave myself. But even if it was I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate at all to laugh. On top of that my dad passed away last year so it got a stronger reaction from me.\n\nWell first told him about my surname and what makes him think it\u2019s okay to laugh at somebody\u2019s name. After I just got up and said this isn\u2019t working, I\u2019d rather not work along someone like him. Guy was immediately apologetic and to come back because his boss (my friend) will lose it but I kept walking. The whole thing got on my nerves. Couple hours later my friend is asking me what happened. He wasn\u2019t mad but he wanted to know why I changed my mind. Still haven\u2019t told him exactly what it was since the guy looked panicked so don\u2019t know about getting him in trouble with my friend.\n\nBut reason friend thinks I\u2019m an asshole is because it was super rude to just get up to leave when the guy was simply joking around and sure he wasn\u2019t trying to be mean intentionally. Not sure really was I an asshole for the way I reacted?\n\nEDIT: Okay yes I will be telling my friend about this. I agree he\u2019s got a right to know what this guy is doing and how it could affect his business. Thanks Reddit \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThis is still a little fresh and for some reason when I (27M) told it to a friend they seem to think I was an asshole for my reaction. I usually work freelance but a buddy of mine owns a small business and desperately looking for new people to hire. He asked me to come in for an interview. This was just a formality since he always wanted me for the position regardless. Tbh I wasn\u2019t so sure I wanted the job but thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to come in regardless. He said I could start part time and work my way to full-time if I like it. \nMy friend left some other guy in charge of interviews, who\u2019s a manager that works under him. Not only was this dude a half hour late but every couple sentences out of my mouth he\u2019d be telling me to pause because his phone would go off and he needed to respond. I Know for a fact it wasn\u2019t work related because who laughs at texts that aren\u2019t personal. Anyways was already annoyed but what really ticked me off was when he looked at my resume and saw my last name. \n\nMy last name is Hummingbird, my dad\u2019s dad came from Native American background although he (and I)  actually don\u2019t know much about it. This guy sees my last name and laughs. He says \u201cwait seriously that\u2019s your last name?\u201d\nTold him yeah what\u2019s the big deal. Guy keeps laughing and he says sorry not judging me just still getting used to some the crazy names people give themselves. He told me this other person who interviewed recently who according to him was obviously a trans female and her name was this ridiculous idk what, but for some reason he found it hilarious. Didn\u2019t think it was funny at all. And he\u2019s laughing because he thinks this is a surname I gave myself. But even if it was I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate at all to laugh. On top of that my dad passed away last year so it got a stronger reaction from me.\n\nWell first told him about my surname and what makes him think it\u2019s okay to laugh at somebody\u2019s name. After I just got up and said this isn\u2019t working, I\u2019d rather not work along someone like him. Guy was immediately apologetic and to come back because his boss (my friend) will lose it but I kept walking. The whole thing got on my nerves. Couple hours later my friend is asking me what happened. He wasn\u2019t mad but he wanted to know why I changed my mind. Still haven\u2019t told him exactly what it was since the guy looked panicked so don\u2019t know about getting him in trouble with my friend.\n\nBut reason friend thinks I\u2019m an asshole is because it was super rude to just get up to leave when the guy was simply joking around and sure he wasn\u2019t trying to be mean intentionally. Not sure really was I an asshole for the way I reacted?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "title": "AITA for not helping my sister and husband pay for their IVF treatment using my inheritance despite having no immediate use for it?",
        "content": "I don't know what all info I should provide so if I miss something that you might need please do ask me and I'll answer asap.\n\nSo I am 25F and my sister, Ella is 31F. My husband = Tom and her husband = John.\n\nElla is bisexual and our parents were religious af. So when she brought home a gf in hs they kicked her out. She never got an inheritance when our mum died. The both of us had cut contact with our parents but I still decided to accept the money because I figured it's the one good thing to come out of our abusive life so why not.\n\nThe legal side of things were finalised a week ago. Ella and John came to see me while Tom was at work and told me they wanted to talk about something important. They said that they had exhausted all of their 'fertility' money and didn't have enough to try ivf again. I could see where this was going so I just said \"I'm sorry Ella, I understand. I was thinking about this as well and Tom thinks this is the right thing to do too. You should have half of the money, you deserve it\"\n\nJohn tells me that's not what they wanted to talk about but that they wanted all of the money. I'm a bit taken aback. Apparently half won't be enough. I tell them that I was going to use my part (or if she didn't want the half, all of it) for my daughter's college fund and another fund for her to use for whatever she wishes during her teen years.\n\nI remind Ella that we always promised each other our children will be financially well off because we never had that growing up. Where I live college is extremely expensive so despite my daughter being only 3 Tom and I wanted to start this for her.\n\nI tell Ella and John all of this and Ella is just very upset at this point. John is more willing to have a conversation though. She comes back from the kicthen and says i'm rubbing the fact that i'm a mother in her face. I'm angry by this point because I thought she loved my daughter like her own. Ella said I was sabotaging her and that I owed her for looking after me when we were kids. John said since Ella \"faced more struggles\" she deserved it all despite knowing full well our parents hurt me regularly as well.\n\nI was just not prepared to fight, my daughter needed my attention and I wanted Tom to be my side because Ella was acting aggressive.\n\nI asked them to leave and called Tom. We discussed this again and agreed we shouldn't give them the money. Ella calls me and I pick up and she tells me she has to try again and that her relationship is rocky because they're frustrated they can't have a kid. I told her I would not give her the entire amount and just hung up.\n\nI feel guilty about all of this now but I don't know if I should. Maybe since I don't have an immediate use for the money I should have given it to her? Am I an asshole?",

        "title": "AITA for firing my kid and then making him work for free?",
        "content": "I own a water park. Before everyone calls bullshit, I never said I own Disneyland. I own a water park. It\u2019s small and local, more like a state fair type situation. I don\u2019t really know how to describe it. That\u2019s irrelevant though. Up until Covid, it was a very successful water park, now it\u2019s a struggling water park. I hire a lot of high schoolers because frankly, who else will work for 10$, free park privileges, free fried food, and no health benefits. Sounds evil but we *used to* have stacks of applicants, even kids calling for \u201cvolunteer\u201d gigs. \n\nBecause of Covid, we\u2019ve had to cut the staff. I hired, maybe 20 less people and cut hours of operation and also now I\u2019ve had to put my teenagers on payroll. Now that my kids (specifically my 16 year old son) work there, they have the same benefits the staff does. They can bring 2 friends for free admission, discounts on 3 others, free food for the 3, discounts for the other 3. Well my kid decided to pull a Richie Rich and act like an asshole and demand everything for free for like 6 people. Security was too scared to kick out the \u201cbosses kid\u201d and called me instead. I had to come there and kick them out myself. \n\nAs a result, I fired and banned my kid and banned his friends. I also am making him pick up trash at park for 6 hours on Saturdays. My wife said this punishment is extreme and embarrassing and I\u2019m   being an asshole. To me I see it as him helping and contributing to the family business. Especially after how he treated the staff who puts food in mouth. What about you guys Reddit, do you guys think I\u2019m being an asshole?\n\nEdit: So I can\u2019t go into too too many details for reasons\u2026 but basically, my kid shows up with 6 hoodlums. They refuse to let security check their bags. One kid has a knife, another weed and booze, one had pepper spray (it was a girl, I give her a slight pass because being a girl is scary, but still against the rules). They refuse to pay, they called a kid  who works the ticket counter who has special needs a retard and basically said that i\u2019d personally make sure he gets fired if he didn\u2019t let them in. Poor guy, is in the process of quitting and I\u2019m trying to convince him not to (may be a lawsuit tbh). When it was lunch time, my kid went behind the snack bar and made food for all his friends and some \u201ccute girls\u201d that were in line and didn\u2019t charge them. He was in a bathing suit and no shoes working a fryer and grill, huge health violations. Then made a mess and refused to clean up after themselves. Then they went up a tall ride and tossed things off them including a can, cause we run a very family oriented park with rides for kids starting at 3 years old. My kid granted wasn\u2019t as bad as some of the others but he knows waaaaaaaaaay better than this. \n\nWith all my family, including my mom and dad working at the park. Also we don\u2019t have an \u201coffice,\u201d its the ticket counter, filled with 16 years olds. We really have no one to leave him with and home and he can\u2019t be trusted home Alone. Willing to take any and all suggestions on how to punish this kid if you think what I\u2019m doing is not right.\n\nFinal edit: thank you all for your comments. At the end of the day, asshole or not, I\u2019m really just trying to play with the cards I\u2019ve been given. Park was closed today for weather. This was a good distraction. I\u2019m turning off comments and will be deleting this profile at some point because I said I lot more than I intended because of some of the legal aspects of this situation. Signing off, will be shutting off notifications. Blessings to you and yours.",

I'm not against the general idea of making him do stuff as a punishment, nor am I against the firing and banning, but if you're banned, you're banned -- that means you need to make him do stuff other places than in the park. And speaking from the point of view of a water park customer, I like banned for this kid a lot better than lurking around the water park with a bag of trash he can use for whatever. I mean, I assume you aren't closed on Saturdays (if you were, that might be a little different, but it would also be weird for a water park.) This kid has already shown he has no respect for your staff or patrons and your staff has already shown that they don't have much in the way of authority over him (fully understandable on their parts, but still a fact that must be acknowledged) and you probably can't have eyes on him every second, so I think it's better he's not there.  \n\n\nI sympathize that you don't want to leave him home alone, but I still think you probably ought to look for a different solution. NTA, though, and certainly not for \"embarrassing\" him and not because picking up trash is an extreme punishment. It's not. I'd really think it was all fine except that I don't think he should be at the park at all right now.",

Before everyone calls bullshit, I never said I own Disneyland. I own a water park. It\u2019s small and local, more like a state fair type situation. I don\u2019t really know how to describe it. That\u2019s irrelevant though. Up until Covid, it was a very successful water park, now it\u2019s a struggling water park. I hire a lot of high schoolers because frankly, who else will work for 10$, free park privileges, free fried food, and no health benefits. Sounds evil but we *used to* have stacks of applicants, even kids calling for \u201cvolunteer\u201d gigs. \n\nBecause of Covid, we\u2019ve had to cut the staff. I hired, maybe 20 less people and cut hours of operation and also now I\u2019ve had to put my teenagers on payroll. Now that my kids (specifically my 16 year old son) work there, they have the same benefits the staff does. They can bring 2 friends for free admission, discounts on 3 others, free food for the 3, discounts for the other 3. Well my kid decided to pull a Richie Rich and act like an asshole and demand everything for free for like 6 people. Security was too scared to kick out the \u201cbosses kid\u201d and called me instead. I had to come there and kick them out myself. \n\nAs a result, I fired and banned my kid and banned his friends. I also am making him pick up trash at park for 6 hours on Saturdays. My wife said this punishment is extreme and embarrassing and I\u2019m   being an asshole. To me I see it as him helping and contributing to the family business. Especially after how he treated the staff who puts food in mouth. What about you guys Reddit, do you guys think I\u2019m being an asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And you only earn 40k a year, and you loaned him a huge chunk of your saving, I'm assuming.\n\nETA: You can sue him via small claims court. I think 5k is small claims. Sure, right now, you probably won't get anything from him. But perchance, in a decade from now (hopefully sooner than that), since he'd be on a lien based on the outcome of this lawsuit, he will be forced to pay you that 5k.\n\nMy parents-in-laws had similar situation, back in the early 80s, they hired a carpenter to come and build them kichen cabinets. He asked them for 10k to start, then another 10k upon completion. They gave him 10k, but he never showed up to work on the kitchen cabinet. In fact, he closed down his business and moved to another town. So my in-laws sued him via small claims court. Of course, since the guy didn't show up despite being served(well, there's a contract written, etc--so it was not merely verbal contract--and there's the check that my in-laws wrote to him which was already cashed--and zero kitchen cabinet) so my in-laws won by default.\n\nIdk about your state, but at our state, you have to 'renew' this type of small claims by extending the lawsuit every few years, which my parents-in-laws did.\n\nLo and behold. 20 years later. This guy was trying to buy a house, and he's got a lien and he can't get a loan. So he bedgrugingly went and paid my parents-in-laws that 10k. \n\nTherefore, OP, go ahead and file your small claims court. Bring the proofs of all the texts, etc, of him promising to pay. The likelihood is he's going to be put on a lien and one day, he may be able to pay you.",

Tom imo has made a lot of bad drug choices in life.  He asked me a few months back if he could borrow 5k.  He said he was homeless and needed help and he could pay me back 10k within 6 months.  I agreed and gave him the 5k.  I only make 40k a year.  6 months later he was pretending not to remember and I sent him a screenshot of the venmo and our texts he agreed to pay me back.  He said i never gave him money and to leave him alone.  I posted it on facebook and tagged all our close friends and his family.  He got really mad and embaressed and said that was a dick move.  I said im out 5k.  I don't care about the interest just give me 5k back.  He said all the money was spent on drugs and he didnt have anything.  I posted that on facebook to and tagged everyone.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The drug thing makes the situation a bit more nuanced and complex, but he's the AH here an it's a case of FAFO. You did him a huge favor due to your history with him, and he decided to screw you over and now somehow he's the victim? Nah, he's trash.

This is sensible advice, but I'd go further personally. The offer to double your money in six months sounds like something out of a bad scam e-mail. Any offer that seems too good to be true probably is, and scammers often use people's (very normal human levels of) greed to lower their guard. You did nothing wrong morally speaking, but you did make a mistake that you should learn from.

I\u2019m not saying this to beat you up over it, but I\u2019ve known people in similar situations that don\u2019t learn and *their dreams* are what gets sacrificed when trying to help a buddy out",

        "content": "I (30/f) do not drive. I never learned how because I\u2019ve been told my whole life I\u2019d be an awful driver due to my ADHD. However, I\u2019ve begun studying for my permit, which I plan to get next month before enrolling in a drivers ed course at my junior college. My main reason behind learning to drive is I\u2019m an in home caregiver for hospice, and it would open my work opportunities drastically if I\u2019m able to drive. \n\nMy new agency has just placed me with a client who is in another town 22 miles away from us. I\u2019ll be working there four nights a week. I told my mom I will give her $200 a month for gas, on top of the $600 rent I pay her and my dad. I haven\u2019t been able to afford my own place in four years, and she\u2019s been sick for three so me being here has helped out a lot (I\u2019m looking for my own place early next year, though).\n\nAnyways, so my sister thinks I\u2019m an asshole for having our sick mother drive me so far for work. I feel awful, too. The only reason I\u2019ve accepted this client is because it\u2019s the client with the most hours my agency has that doesn\u2019t require running errands. Plus it helps working noc as I\u2019ll be able to help around the house during the day. My shift is from 7pm to 7am but I\u2019m having my mom drop me off at a park near my clients home at 530 so she isn\u2019t stuck driving in the dark. \n\nI\u2019m so torn up about this. I\u2019m hoping to have my license by spring of next year so I won\u2019t have to worry about this anymore. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nETA: I was wondering why people thought I was only paying her $200/month. I meant $200 a check, so $400 a month. Sorry about that! D:",

Good for you for trying to change your situation! You're going to be fine as a driver; plenty of people with ADHD drive with no issues.

Also everyone on here saying \u201cfind another way to work\u201d they\u2019re ignorant. As if finding a job is that easy easily one with that pays a liveable wage. Also why is everyone acting like it\u2019s just so easy to get your license right away??  Where I live it takes a year without driving school after getting the permit and with driving school 8 months. And that doesn\u2019t include how difficult it is to get a test.

I never learned how because I\u2019ve been told my whole life I\u2019d be an awful driver due to my ADHD. However, I\u2019ve begun studying for my permit, which I plan to get next month before enrolling in a drivers ed course at my junior college. My main reason behind learning to drive is I\u2019m an in home caregiver for hospice, and it would open my work opportunities drastically if I\u2019m able to drive. \n\nMy new agency has just placed me with a client who is in another town 22 miles away from us. I\u2019ll be working there four nights a week. I told my mom I will give her $200 a month for gas, on top of the $600 rent I pay her and my dad. I haven\u2019t been able to afford my own place in four years, and she\u2019s been sick for three so me being here has helped out a lot (I\u2019m looking for my own place early next year, though).\n\nAnyways, so my sister thinks I\u2019m an asshole for having our sick mother drive me so far for work. I feel awful, too. The only reason I\u2019ve accepted this client is because it\u2019s the client with the most hours my agency has that doesn\u2019t require running errands. Plus it helps working noc as I\u2019ll be able to help around the house during the day. My shift is from 7pm to 7am but I\u2019m having my mom drop me off at a park near my clients home at 530 so she isn\u2019t stuck driving in the dark. \n\nI\u2019m so torn up about this. I\u2019m hoping to have my license by spring of next year so I won\u2019t have to worry about this anymore. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "content": "My older sister is getting married in a few months and I was supposed to be maid of honor but two weeks ago I had to make the decision to pull out. My sister is pissed. And I have told her she needs to understand my position here but she claims I'm only making excuses so I said I would let you guys decide. \n\nMy husband and I adopted our kids from foster care two years ago. Our son was 6 and our daughter was 4. We had them for a year before the adoption was finalized. Days before we all went into lockdown our daughter was diagnosed with RAD (reactive attachment disorder), which in our case meant she was prone to anger and did not form attachments with people, including us, and it was both a relief and a curse. It was a curse because it happened when we couldn't attend in person therapies and she needed them. It was months before she could attend therapies in person and she did not cope well with being cooped up with us. We finally started to see some improvements with her and life was starting to take some shape. But then life went to shit several weeks ago.\n\nOne of their former foster parents was in jail and got out. We were notified and the social worker did a poor job of the notification in that she just announced it at the door with the kids in earshot. It resulted in what I would call a relapse of RAD in our daughter and in our son, he became very emotionally distressed and clingy and has needed to go under evaluation to see what the best course of treatment is. Right now I am the parent they do better around, especially our daughter, who is starting to reject my husband again and the healthy attachment she had with him is almost non-existent again due to what we believe is suppressed trauma relating to their former foster home.\n\nRight now I am not working. I am basically working through therapies and we have moved to school online for both for the upcoming year due to the challenges we are now facing. I can't dedicate time to my sisters wedding. We're unsure whether I will even make it. I can't put stuff on my husband relating to our daughter while I focus on maid of honor stuff because it is a safety issue. Their interactions are done with me around or in a controlled environment with the therapist present. \n\nMy sister does not feel this is a valid reason to drop out. She said I should be putting her first here, and as her only sister, being maid of honor should be important to me.\n\nAITA?",

This is to ensure the health and safety of the child; to make sure the transition is going well. Abuse can still occur in adoptive homes \u2014 not that OP is doing that, but that\u2019s the reason for the visits. Also, a lot of kids get attached to their social workers, so the temporary monthly visits help them transition, too. Yes, OP may need to be notified about the foster parent being released from jail if it poses a safety issue.\n\nSecond, there are also likely \u201csafety plans\u201d put in place for the adoptive home for the purpose of the transition. These usually say things like OP will take child to therapy and follow all recommendations, bio parents may not see or speak with the child if banned by the courts due to egregious abuse, etc. It really sounds like this child has some serious therapy needs (as most kids do from the system. A LOT have emotional and behavioral issues at the end of it all, especially with anger). This child is dealing with trauma and it sounds like per OP\u2019s child\u2019s therapist, it is recommended the child not be left alone with male figures. Currently, it seems she has limited childcare options until her child can overcome her trauma. It doesn\u2019t sound as simple as \u201cleave the kids with husband.\u201d",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy older sister is getting married in a few months and I was supposed to be maid of honor but two weeks ago I had to make the decision to pull out. My sister is pissed. And I have told her she needs to understand my position here but she claims I'm only making excuses so I said I would let you guys decide. \n\nMy husband and I adopted our kids from foster care two years ago. Our son was 6 and our daughter was 4. We had them for a year before the adoption was finalized. Days before we all went into lockdown our daughter was diagnosed with RAD (reactive attachment disorder), which in our case meant she was prone to anger and did not form attachments with people, including us, and it was both a relief and a curse. It was a curse because it happened when we couldn't attend in person therapies and she needed them. It was months before she could attend therapies in person and she did not cope well with being cooped up with us. We finally started to see some improvements with her and life was starting to take some shape. But then life went to shit several weeks ago.\n\nOne of their former foster parents was in jail and got out. We were notified and the social worker did a poor job of the notification in that she just announced it at the door with the kids in earshot. It resulted in what I would call a relapse of RAD in our daughter and in our son, he became very emotionally distressed and clingy and has needed to go under evaluation to see what the best course of treatment is. Right now I am the parent they do better around, especially our daughter, who is starting to reject my husband again and the healthy attachment she had with him is almost non-existent again due to what we believe is suppressed trauma relating to their former foster home.\n\nRight now I am not working. I am basically working through therapies and we have moved to school online for both for the upcoming year due to the challenges we are now facing. I can't dedicate time to my sisters wedding. We're unsure whether I will even make it. I can't put stuff on my husband relating to our daughter while I focus on maid of honor stuff because it is a safety issue. Their interactions are done with me around or in a controlled environment with the therapist present. \n\nMy sister does not feel this is a valid reason to drop out. She said I should be putting her first here, and as her only sister, being maid of honor should be important to me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

I understand that weddings are a huge life event, but when it comes at the cost of your children's future and mental health there is no comparison. A lot of people don't realize that mental health is just as important in regards to safety as physical health, so they discount that as not being important or a good enough reason to back out. Especially since a lot of the times it's discounted as bad behavior or an attitude. But in actuality you're doing the most responsible thing you could as a parent by seeing to your child's health, both mentally and physically. \n\nAlso for everyone who is saying it's just 12 hours, trauma manifests without triggers a lot of the time, so I can only imagine how much worse it could be if you actually put her in a position that you know triggers her (ie being alone with a male figure), even if it's her dad. You have already seen a regression in her behavior due to the pandemic and a loss of access to therapists, so you're only doing what you can to stipend that regression and not contribute to it. Which is the only thing a parent who has a child with the disorder can do a lot of the times. Both of your kids are so lucky to have you and your husband as parents because you guys are so patient, loving, and prioritize their well being.",

        "content": "\nI (26F) am engaged to my fianc\u00e9 (28M), and we\u2019ve been together for about 3 years. In elementary school, I\u2019ve had teachers tell my mother that I should be tested for high functioning autism (aspergers), but was never officially diagnosed. When I was about two years old, I could not keep my hands off of a pair of my moms textured shorts, so my mom cut them up into a square so I could sleep with it. And it became a security blanket for me ever since then. I couldn\u2019t sleep without it, and if I lost it somewhere in the house before bed time, my mom would help me look for it until we found it. I love my mom very much, she was a single mother since I was 9. She\u2019s my rock to this day. The original blankie got old and torn up, so one of my aunts had found a shawl at the goodwill with a similar texture and gifted it to me when I was around 11. I\u2019ve had the same one since then. I took my blankie pretty much everywhere with me, as the texture of it just calmed my anxiety and made me feel a safe and familiar feeling. I took it to sleepovers at friends houses, and I put it in my backpack to take to school. I still sleep with it every night, and use it when I get home, but I don\u2019t bring it in public anymore. Well, sometimes I bring it for car rides but it doesn\u2019t leave the car. My fianc\u00e9 started voicing concerns about me having a blankie at my age, and how he doesn\u2019t approve of it. We want to have children one day, and he asked me \u201cWhat are you going to tell our children if they want to copy you and have a blankie well into adulthood?\u201d And I told him that I don\u2019t mind or care if my children (adult or not) want to have something that brings them comfort, like my blankie does for me. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to receive comfort from an inanimate object, and we\u2019ve had a few arguments about it, and I told him I\u2019m never throwing away my blankie. I\u2019ve stood firm that there\u2019s nothing wrong or bad about having one when you sleep. He\u2019s told me to just grow up, and that it\u2019s weird and creepy for me to have one. He\u2019s mentioned a few times he wants to throw it out, but he hasn\u2019t thrown it out yet. I know this man loves me, and is an honest, hardworking, loving, supportive, and affectionate person towards me. But he won\u2019t change his mind about my blankie and is annoyed and maybe a little angered that I flat out refuse to never give it up. AITA??\n\nEDIT: My fianc\u00e9 has diagnosed Aspergers, so I think he understands why the texture calms me down, and he still thinks it\u2019s unhealthy. It\u2019s a little hurtful that he understands why, but still doesn\u2019t care to accept it. He doesn\u2019t have any comfort objects of his own. But at the same time I feel bad shutting down and invalidating all his concerns about the blankie :(",

There's nothing wrong with finding comfort in something inanimate, and I know a lot of my friends who are neurodivergent (are autistic, have ADHD, personality disorders, etc.) find comfort in blankies or stuffed animals, etc. It's just public perception being ableist and thinking adulthood should look one way when in reality there's not really one template for how to be an adult. \n\nAnd on another sidenote, I hope your fiance learns to maybe listen to you more and appreciate that while he may not understand why you keep your blanket, that it's important to you and that that is enough.\n\nDunno if that made too much sense but tl:dr you're not the asshole, ableist expectations of adulthood are afoot and you're fine to keep your blanket.",

I'm a step-parent to two kids (both autisitic as is my husband.) I use adult pacifiers for self-soothing. I use baby sippy cups because I struggle to hold glasses without spilling them. Those kids get it and one of them has their own adult pacifier I made for them to self-soothe with. If it brings your kid/partner/parent/friend/whoever comfort, you let them have it.\n\nSounds like your partner may need their own comfort toy so he can understand why you need yours. Either way - you are NTA and if he does throw it out - that will show exactly his thoughts and concerns for your mental well-being.\n\nSide note - self dx is just as valid as medical dx. It's just a matter of privilege if doctors take you seriously about being autistic. And unfortunately being a woman you're more likely to be diagnosed with a personality disorder than being autistic and neurodivergent :/",

In elementary school, I\u2019ve had teachers tell my mother that I should be tested for high functioning autism (aspergers), but was never officially diagnosed. When I was about two years old, I could not keep my hands off of a pair of my moms textured shorts, so my mom cut them up into a square so I could sleep with it. And it became a security blanket for me ever since then. I couldn\u2019t sleep without it, and if I lost it somewhere in the house before bed time, my mom would help me look for it until we found it. I love my mom very much, she was a single mother since I was 9. She\u2019s my rock to this day. The original blankie got old and torn up, so one of my aunts had found a shawl at the goodwill with a similar texture and gifted it to me when I was around 11. I\u2019ve had the same one since then. I took my blankie pretty much everywhere with me, as the texture of it just calmed my anxiety and made me feel a safe and familiar feeling. I took it to sleepovers at friends houses, and I put it in my backpack to take to school. I still sleep with it every night, and use it when I get home, but I don\u2019t bring it in public anymore. Well, sometimes I bring it for car rides but it doesn\u2019t leave the car. My fianc\u00e9 started voicing concerns about me having a blankie at my age, and how he doesn\u2019t approve of it. We want to have children one day, and he asked me \u201cWhat are you going to tell our children if they want to copy you and have a blankie well into adulthood?\u201d And I told him that I don\u2019t mind or care if my children (adult or not) want to have something that brings them comfort, like my blankie does for me. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to receive comfort from an inanimate object, and we\u2019ve had a few arguments about it, and I told him I\u2019m never throwing away my blankie. I\u2019ve stood firm that there\u2019s nothing wrong or bad about having one when you sleep. He\u2019s told me to just grow up, and that it\u2019s weird and creepy for me to have one. He\u2019s mentioned a few times he wants to throw it out, but he hasn\u2019t thrown it out yet. I know this man loves me, and is an honest, hardworking, loving, supportive, and affectionate person towards me. But he won\u2019t change his mind about my blankie and is annoyed and maybe a little angered that I flat out refuse to never give it up.

Don't feel like an asshole for not respecting your fianc\u00e9's wishes, when he's not respecting your reasons for wanting to keep it. \n\nYou could also maybe suggest some limits you'll put in place on where/when you bring out the blankie, if you feel comfortable doing that. Mine stays in the bedroom, which was a limit I set for myself when I first moved away from home, long before I met my current partner. If you can agree that maybe you wont bring it on car rides anymore, or only bring it out after 8pm or something like that, it might make him feel like you're meeting him part-way.\n\nAlso you mention that you have a therapist, but does your fianc\u00e9 have one? Might be worth saying you'll bring it up with your therapist if he also speaks to a therapist about it. As lots of people have said, I don't think any reputable therapist would recommend throwing something harmless away, just because of external pressure.  I imagine he's telling you to bring it up with your therapist because he expects them to agree with him that it's unhealthy in some way.

Your fiance has every right to to be embarassed by his ADULT future wife that takes a \"blankie\" with her everywhere she goes. Do you suck your thumb too? The fact that you call it a \"blankie\" and not a \"blanket\" is very telling here. Children say \"blankie\". This indicates that you are not emotionally mature enough to even be getting married. At the very least, you need to put on your big girl panties and compromise. Keep your \"blankie\" at home. He has every right to be embarassed if his wife shows up to a fancy gathering/cocktail party/work function clutching a blankie like a toddler.

You keep your blankie, it doesn't harm anyone and is way more healthy than drinking, drugs or other stuff that people use when anxious \n\nAt first glance I thought your boyfriend is rude and therefore an A. Who is he to take away your comfort? But I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt: maybe he is uneducated about the needs of people with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, which you suspect you have. \n\nMy advice: get a diagnosis, talk to a professional and get both of you educated when you indeed have Aspergers. Especially if you want kids: it's fantastic when you know beforehand where your potential triggers lie and how to cope with them. It's fantastic but exhausting to have kids and many people - not only people with a diagnosed condition - can benefit by learning more about their mental health and their emotional triggers, so they can be the best parents they can be. \n\nGood luck!

        "content": "I've (30M) always been super careful with my own money. For most of my professional life i earned a little more than a minimum wage and always kept my costs and lifestyle on the low. I've been working since 16yo and never got a single debt on my name (something i'm proud of). This past year i got a very good job and i've been able to save a lot of money so i can finally buy my own house and leave rent.\n\nI've been dating her (23F) for 2 years and i met her in one of my jobs at a College. She was a student there. Cause of financial problems on her family she had to quit college leaving some debt behind. Her parents used to pay for her college.\n\nI've been living with her for 1 year and i pay everything (food, rent, etc.). After moving together i feel like her parents kinda expect me to pay for everything related to her. Her father once asked me why i didnt put her back on college to finish her course and i told him very politely that i couldnt afford it since it was more than 50% of my monthly income and i had rent, food and everything else to pay for. We get zero help from them.\n\nToday she received an email from this college saying they will pass her debts along to justice and stuff and she could negociate. She called me and said \"i have something serious to ask. i need you to pay my debt\". I said i dont want to cause this is a debt her parents made, not me. Also her debt is almost 50% of everything i could save this past year. It's a huge chunk of my savings. She is silent all day after that. AITA here?  \n\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all your answers. Guess it's time to have THE TALK with her and put all the cards on the table if we are really to get a future together.\n\nEDIT 2: We had a talk last night and she was very understanding that I couldnt and shouldnt pay the debt. She will contact her father to figure things out cause she said It was his Idea and he didnt got through on the payments. She is jobless right now but she promised she would look for one right away. I'll hold the marriage until things are stable financially for both of us. I've seen my parents marriage crumble because of money problems and i won't have that again in my life. Thank you all for the inputs.",

Or having her take out some minimal loans to continue, while you provided support in the forms of housing and food. She'd end up with a job in a much higher pay bracket and be more employable than she currently is, and that salary would feed back into your shared household, repaying itself.\n\nHowever, it seems like you might not be there yet. \n\nIn which case: I think your girlfriend is mentally young, having gone from her parent's protection to yours, and financially illiterate since she's never had to figure this out. It makes sense that she'd ask you for help, after getting that big, scary notice about being sent to justice and all that. I think it would be wise to hand hold her walk through this process of dealing with her loan, and handling money. You don't need to take the debt in for her, but help her figure it out and make it seem doable.\n\nThat said, it doesn't seem like she owes a whole lot, since it's the equivalent of half a year's savings, rather than an amount that would take decades to repay. Don't be surprised if she is now harboring some \"I'm panicked and scared, he has the ability to help, and he isn't helping, so what does that say about him?\" Second thoughts on your character and long term prospects. Circumvent that by stepping in to help, albeit in a different way than signing over a check.",

For most of my professional life i earned a little more than a minimum wage and always kept my costs and lifestyle on the low. I've been working since 16yo and never got a single debt on my name (something i'm proud of). This past year i got a very good job and i've been able to save a lot of money so i can finally buy my own house and leave rent.\n\nI've been dating her (23F) for 2 years and i met her in one of my jobs at a College. She was a student there. Cause of financial problems on her family she had to quit college leaving some debt behind. Her parents used to pay for her college. \n\nI've been living with her for 1 year and i pay everything (food, rent, etc.). After moving together i feel like her parents kinda expect me to pay for everything related to her. Her father once asked me why i didnt put her back on college to finish her course and i told him very politely that i couldnt afford it since it was more than 50% of my monthly income and i had rent, food and everything else to pay for. We get zero help from them. \n\nToday she received an email from this college saying they will pass her debts along to justice and stuff and she could negociate. She called me and said \"i have something serious to ask. i need you to pay my debt\". I said i dont want to cause this is a debt her parents made, not me. Also her debt is almost 50% of everything i could save this past year. It's a huge chunk of my savings. She is silent all day after that. AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "title": "AITA For removing tree roots from my yard",
        "content": "My family and I moved into a new home this spring.  We had previously lived in apartments and we now have our first yard for our kids to play in.  The neighborhood we moved into has a lot of mature trees, and this being the first time I've had to do my own yard work, there has been a learning curve.  \n\nOne of my neighbor's yard is separated from ours by a chain link fence.  There is a large tree just on their side of the fence.  Some roots from the tree spread into my yard and some of them are growing on the surface of the ground.  They are visible and are above the ground quite a bit.  About a month ago, my kids were running around and playing and my daughter tripped on one of the roots, fell, and ended up breaking her wrist trying to catch herself.  \n\nOf course, this was very upsetting to my wife and I and she pretty much told me to do something about the roots so this didn't happen again.  So, I bought some tools and started tearing the roots up as best I could.  I got them out to a point that nothing is sticking above the ground anymore and filled the top in with fresh soil and grass seed.  \n\nMy neighbor must have noticed the work I did because he made a comment about the fresh soil.  I told him I had to remove some roots since my daughter tripped on one.  He asked what I meant by \"remove\" and I told him I dug a bunch out and cut them out as best I could.  \n\nHe got pissed and told me I probably killed his tree.  I told him that removing a few roots isn't going to hurt a tree that big and they were creating a tripping hazard.  And since they were in my yard, I did what I needed to do to remove them.  \n\nHe told me there are other ways to deal with roots like that instead of cutting them out and causing stress to the tree and he would have gladly helped if I had asked.  He said that tree is probably going to die which means it is probably going to have to be removed and said that a tree that large is going to cost thousands of dollars to take out.  \n\nI told him that sounds ridiculously expensive.  He said if the tree dies and he has to have it cut down, he's going to ask me to pay for some of it because of what I did to the roots.  I told him good luck with that and that I'm not paying anything for his tree.  \n\nHe called me an asshole and told me the previous neighbors at least had the decency to ask for help when they didn't know what the hell they were doing instead of causing damage to other people's property.  \n\nI told my wife about it and she thinks the guy is just being a jerk and agrees with me that taking a few roots from the top of the ground isn't going to hurt a tree that big.  She also agrees that there is no way in hell we are going to pay for anything for this guy's tree.  We were just making sure our yard is safe for our kids to play in, it's not our fault his tree grew roots into our yard.",

        "content": "Me (30F) and my husband (31M) recently bought our first house. At the closing, the previous owner mentioned that he had a lawn service he really liked, but we planned on cutting our own grass so didn\u2019t look into it any further. \n\nFor the first six weeks or so that we owned the house, we didn\u2019t live in it as it was being renovated. We noticed that the grass had been cut, but we never saw a service and no one ever spoke to us so we assumed the previous owner still had some time left on his contract or something like that. \n\nI bet you can guess where this is going.... the previous owner forgot to cancel the lawn service and is now demanding we pay for the past six weeks. I don\u2019t want to because we literally never hired a lawn service and I don\u2019t want to pay for his mistake. He was also a pain throughout the process which might be coloring my judgment here (examples include pushing the closing date by 30 days at the last minute, leaving us scrambling to find housing, not disclosing a roof leak that he definitely knew about, etc). \n\nI might be the asshole because I could\u2019ve checked with him if the lawn service was still supposed to be working. I also feel bad for the lawn service who has been ringing my doorbell at all hours trying to collect.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMe (30F) and my husband (31M) recently bought our first house. At the closing, the previous owner mentioned that he had a lawn service he really liked, but we planned on cutting our own grass so didn\u2019t look into it any further. \n\nFor the first six weeks or so that we owned the house, we didn\u2019t live in it as it was being renovated. We noticed that the grass had been cut, but we never saw a service and no one ever spoke to us so we assumed the previous owner still had some time left on his contract or something like that. \n\nI bet you can guess where this is going.... the previous owner forgot to cancel the lawn service and is now demanding we pay for the past six weeks. I don\u2019t want to because we literally never hired a lawn service and I don\u2019t want to pay for his mistake. He was also a pain throughout the process which might be coloring my judgment here (examples include pushing the closing date by 30 days at the last minute, leaving us scrambling to find housing, not disclosing a roof leak that he definitely knew about, etc). \n\nI might be the asshole because I could\u2019ve checked with him if the lawn service was still supposed to be working. I also feel bad for the lawn service who has been ringing my doorbell at all hours trying to collect.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in the US, if not *ignore me*)\n\nYou *must* pay tradespeople. If they show up and paint your house an ugly color because they got the wrong address, if an asshole neighbor calls them to come trim your hedges for you, if the seller forgets to cancel his lawn service. The homeowner *must pay.* If you do not pay, they will(legally) ruin your life. \n\nThe laws in these situations are very much not on your side. The protections are almost entirely in favor of the tradespeople. Whether you or I or Reddit agree with that is irrelevant. They will still take you to court and they can still place a lien on your home. The *property* owes them money, and as the current owner you have to pay that money or never be able sell your home. \n\nWhat you need to do, first off, is pay them. I\u2019m sorry to be the bearer of bad news. In the process of paying them, you need to get a lawyer and get the lawn service to give you all the information they have on the contract with the seller. *Then* you need to take the *seller* to court to recoup your damages. I don\u2019t know if this will be a small claims situation or not. But unfortunately you are legally required to pay for any work done to your property while you own it. If you do not pay, they will place a lien on your home until you do. Your only recourse here is to go after the seller. Do *not* fuck around with the lawn guys. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re not an asshole, but if you decide to take legal advice from AITA on a *legal matter* you are going to get royally fucked over. At minimum *please* talk to a lawyer ASAP to figure out what your legal obligations actually are. This is a situation where your status as asshole or not is completely irrelevant. You need to talk to lawyer immediately.",

She and I text a lot and she told me she has horrible back pain that doesn\u2019t go away even with meds and I told her to use hot water bag which she does but it gets cold too quickly. So I got her a heated blanket that also vibrates for her pain. We had dinner and I gave her the present and she opened it in front of her husband which I didn\u2019t think was a big deal until she started fiddling with the controls and the blanket started vibrating. Her husband got really angry and told me to take back the present since it was a vibrator! I was speechless because how is a blanket a vibrator? He told us to get out which we did and slammed the door behind us. My friend texted me and told me it was probably better that we didn\u2019t see each other again and she is angry I let her turn it on in front of her husband and I\u2019m so shocked but should I have seen it coming? They are Egyptian so I assume there are cultural difference but I didn\u2019t expect this. AITA?",

She and I text a lot and she told me she has horrible back pain that doesn\u2019t go away even with meds and I told her to use hot water bag which she does but it gets cold too quickly. So I got her a heated blanket that also vibrates for her pain. We had dinner and I gave her the present and she opened it in front of her husband which I didn\u2019t think was a big deal until she started fiddling with the controls and the blanket started vibrating. Her husband got really angry and told me to take back the present since it was a vibrator! I was speechless because how is a blanket a vibrator? He told us to get out which we did and slammed the door behind us. My friend texted me and told me it was probably better that we didn\u2019t see each other again and she is angry I get her turn it on in front of her husband and I\u2019m so shocked but should I have seen it coming? They are Egyptian so I assume there are cultural difference but I didn\u2019t expect this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "content": "I'm a model tenant. Always paid my rent on time, I'm a bit neurotic when it comes to cleaning, quiet and respectful and I've been renting this house for 8 years. The owners adore me. My old property manager was a peach to deal with but she moved on to a different company and I met my new property manager this morning when she came around to do an inspection. \n\nI took the day off work because I wanted to meet her and it was going well until she passed me the report saying that everything looked good, but I had to remove the two armchairs in the living room. I asked what was wrong with them and she said that they were 'ratty and an eyesore'. The said armchairs in question I've had for 3 years however I got them off a friend who didn't want them anymore. The leather is worn and torn, they're an awful shade of green/brown and yeah, they're ugly as all hell but they're the most comfortable armchairs I've ever sank into. They don't smell or anything either.\n\nI told her they've never been an issue before and the previous manager had shown photos of the living room to the owners and they'd never said anything either. She was kind of rude and snapped saying that (old manager) isn't the property manager now, but she is and that I should take her advice because she can and will feed back everything to the owners. I dunno if it was a power trip or something that she was on but I scoffed/laughed at her and said \"Yeah nah, get stuffed\" kinda without thinking and then followed up with \"Sorry but your job is to make sure the house is being maintained, not to come in and tell me to ditch my stuff.\"\n\nThe inspection ended on a sour note obviously and she ended with \"if those arm chairs are here next inspection then I'll follow it up with the owners. Just remember that my feedback is a deciding factor in whether or not you continue to stay here.\" \n\nBit rude. Didn't think much of it. Told my mum who said I was unneccessarily rude though so that brings me here.",

Always paid my rent on time, I'm a bit neurotic when it comes to cleaning, quiet and respectful and I've been renting this house for 8 years. The owners adore me. My old property manager was a peach to deal with but she moved on to a different company and I met my new property manager this morning when she came around to do an inspection. \n\nI took the day off work because I wanted to meet her and it was going well until she passed me the report saying that everything looked good, but I had to remove the two armchairs in the living room. I asked what was wrong with them and she said that they were 'ratty and an eyesore'. The said armchairs in question I've had for 3 years however I got them off a friend who didn't want them anymore. The leather is worn and torn, they're an awful shade of green/brown and yeah, they're ugly as all hell but they're the most comfortable armchairs I've ever sank into. They don't smell or anything either.\n\nI told her they've never been an issue before and the previous manager had shown photos of the living room to the owners and they'd never said anything either. She was kind of rude and snapped saying that (old manager) isn't the property manager now, but she is and that I should take her advice because she can and will feed back everything to the owners. I dunno if it was a power trip or something that she was on but I scoffed/laughed at her and said \"Yeah nah, get stuffed\" kinda without thinking and then followed up with \"Sorry but your job is to make sure the house is being maintained, not to come in and tell me to ditch my stuff.\"\n\nThe inspection ended on a sour note obviously and she ended with \"if those arm chairs are here next inspection then I'll follow it up with the owners. Just remember that my feedback is a deciding factor in whether or not you continue to stay here.\" \n\nBit rude. Didn't think much of it. Told my mum who said I was unneccessarily rude though so that brings me here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Me and derek have grown a strong bond, and I sometime invite him over to play transformers and such, but lately, all he wants to do is watch TV and eat all of my snacks.\n\nI played outside with him, but he just begs to go inside my house, and comes knocking every 8am to ask if he can come inside. I almost always refuse, saying that I can't because my parents are asleep, or something like that.\n\nBut he always says \"But my dad said I can come to your house\" and just begs and begs and sometimes starts crying. I usually let him in after that, but yesterday, I tell no the can't come in sternly and say that it was super early and he can't just demand to come in.\n\nHe leaves, crying, and I haven't seen him in a while. AITA??\n\nTLDR; My young neighbor keeps begging to come in my house and I finally tell him no, and he starts crying.",

If it doesn't sort it self out maybe he can only come over after dinner. So that way he has to be home before bed. Creating a natural time limit on how long he is over and maybe he won't be so hungry after dinner and you won't lose all your snacks.\n\n**also Thank you for being a great neighbor to Derek!** Don't feel bad for making him cry, he just likes spending time with you and most 5 year olds can't express that in words so he just cries.

If you are ok with playing with him in the garden, make that your boundary. If you are ok with him coming over between 10am and sending him home for lunch, say so. But if you are also doing this daily you also should be paid for your services.\n\nYoung children can get confused about where their parents\u2019 authority begins and ends too. In their house, what his dad says, goes. So he fully believes his dad has the right to tell him *and* you that he can come to your house. Kiddo needs to learn that each household makes the rules for their own home, and what his dad says is ok in their house might not be ok in yours.",

Since he's a kid, he might accept and understand rules from your parents even when he questions you (do touch base with your parents, so they know the deal and can back up your stance) Also try setting specific days or times when Derek can *ask* to come over (not guaranteed to come over), such as only Tuesday or Thursday, and after 4, or by saying he must have his dad text you to ask first. And tell Derek that if he starts crying, he has to go home.\n\nIf that doesn't fix stuff, reach out to Derek's parents to say you like the little guy, but you're not a babysitter, so they need to ask before sending him over, and only during such and such times, and you're only willing to play with him outside.",

Let's call him Derek. Me and derek have grown a strong bond, and I sometime invite him over to play transformers and such, but lately, all he wants to do is watch TV and eat all of my snacks.\n\nI played outside with him, but he just begs to go inside my house, and comes knocking every 8am to ask if he can come inside. I almost always refuse, saying that I can't because my parents are asleep, or something like that.\n\nBut he always says \"But my dad said I can come to your house\" and just begs and begs and sometimes starts crying. I usually let him in after that, but yesterday, I tell no the can't come in sternly and say that it was super early and he can't just demand to come in.\n\nHe leaves, crying, and I haven't seen him in a while. AITA??\n\nTLDR; My young neighbor keeps begging to come in my house and I finally tell him no, and he starts crying.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
